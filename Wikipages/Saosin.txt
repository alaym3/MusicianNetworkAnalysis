'''Saosin''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Orange County, California]] in 2003, originally formed by [[Beau Burchell]], [[Justin Shekoski]], Zach Kennedy, and [[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]]. The band released their first EP, ''[[Translating the Name]]'' in 2003. That same year original vocalist [[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]] left Saosin due to personal reasons. In 2004, [[Cove Reber]] replaced Green as vocalist after auditioning for the role. With Reber the group recorded its [[Saosin (album)|self titled debut album]] which was released on [[Capitol Records]] on September 26, 2006. Their second studio album, ''[[In Search of Solid Ground]]'', was released on September 8, 2009 on [[Virgin Records]] and contains three re-recorded tracks from ''The Grey EP''. In 2010, Reber was dismissed from the band. In 2013, the band reformed with all original members, except Zach, and began touring. They released ''[[Along the Shadow]]'', their third studio album and first studio album with original vocalist Anthony Green, on May 20, 2016 through [[Epitaph Records]].

Saosin emerged at the beginning of the [[emo]] and [[post-hardcore]] scene in the early 2000s, and has been regarded for their harmonizing vocals, lead guitar riffs with delays and natural harmonics as a form of creating melodies.[https://thenewfury.com/the-vault-revisiting-saosins-debut-ep-translating-the-name/] 

==Origin of name==
[[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]] had initially suggested the name "Saosin" for the band. Saosin means "careful" in Chinese (小心 xiǎo xīn). The word comes from a 15th-century [[proverb]] about fathers admonishing their sons who are being married off for money to not get emotionally involved with their wives, as they could die at any time. Green explained the meaning behind this as being a reference to the fact that nothing is eternal, and that it is a mistake to become overly attached to anyone or anything, because that thing will eventually be lost.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web|url=http://www.saosin.forumsunlimited.com/index.php?showtopic=12111|title=Saosin FAQ|access-date=August 27, 2006|author=Samantha Klingman|publisher=Saosin.com}}</ref> While Green's personal interpretation of the word 小心 is obscure, 小心 is generally used in Chinese as a means to express caution. Green had previously used "Saosin" as a track name in his high school band, Audience of One, ''I Remember When This All Meant Something''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p579297|pure_url=yes}}|title=Saosin biography|access-date=May 21, 2008|author=Corey Apar|publisher=Allmusic.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/3619|title=Audience of One; Anthony Green's high school band|publisher=Punknews.org|access-date=May 21, 2008}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and ''Translating the Name'' (2003–2004)===
The original lineup for Saosin, consisting of Burchell, [[Justin Shekoski|Shekoski]], Kennedy and Green, was formed in the summer of 2003.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} On June 17, the band released their first commercial production, the [[Extended Play|EP]] ''[[Translating the Name]]''.<ref name="emo">{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalpunk.com/cdreview/222/ |title=Saosin: ''Translating the Name'' |author=Andrew Martin |publisher=Emotionalpunk.com |access-date=May 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816194745/http://www.emotionalpunk.com/cdreview/222/ |archive-date=August 16, 2007 }}</ref> It was an immediate success and was immensely popular on online forums and music sites.

Saosin first became popular through promotion and exposure through the [[Internet]]. They became known for their distinct musical styles long before their first studio-length album was released, and were popularized on social networking and music sites such as [[MySpace]]. The E.P. has sold an estimated 62,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/artists/showlink.php?do=showdetails&l=2426|title=Saosin -- band profile|access-date=May 21, 2008|publisher=Absolutepunk.com}}</ref>

Bassist Zach Kennedy left the band early on, as he wanted to pursue a career in art.<ref name=FAQ/> He was later replaced by [[Chris Sorenson]]. 
A local Southern Californian drummer by the name of Pat Magrath <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/thepatmagrath |title=Pat Magrath |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2016-01-19 |access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> was hired only for the recording for the EP, according to Burchell. The band was impressed with his drumming skills, however, and he later appeared as a guest performing Lost Symphonies live with the band. Alex Rodriguez was unable to record Translating the Name as he had promised his band at the time [[Open Hand]] he would finish recording with them. Danny King filled in for live drums with the band before Rodriguez completed his responsibilities with Open Hand and joined Saosin full-time after the EP release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nipp.com/artists/detail/saosin|title=Saosin Bio|publisher=Nipp.com|access-date=May 21, 2008}}</ref> Saosin went on a U.S. tour with bands [[Boys Night Out (band)|Boys Night Out]] and [[Anatomy of a Ghost]] shortly after the release of Translating the Name.

In February 2004, the band's vocalist [[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]] left Saosin and later formed the band [[Circa Survive]]. Green was homesick, depressed<ref name=punkbands.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.punkbands.com/interviews/226/|title=Interview with Anthony Green @ Punkbands.com|access-date=July 7, 2010}}</ref> and said he was missing his family. Green was also disenchanted with the direction of Saosin and disliked that the band excluded him from the writing process.<ref name=punkbands.com /> The band finished their [[Warped Tour]] obligations with [[Story of the Year]]'s [[Philip Sneed]] taking the mic. A public, nationwide audition then took place.

''[[Translating the Name]]'' was viewed as "expanding the limits" of the post-hardcore genre and rewriting the music scene.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-10-10|title=The Vault: Why Saosin's debut EP, "Translating The Name", remains one of post-hardcore's finest|url=https://thenewfury.com/the-vault-revisiting-saosins-debut-ep-translating-the-name/|access-date=2021-05-09|website=New Fury Media|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] noted that with the release of the EP, Saosin stirred the underground and had many labels scurrying to sign them.<ref>{{Cite web|last=AltPress|date=2016-05-03|title=Taste Of Tuesday: In 2006, Saosin were tasked with surpassing their own accomplishments|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/taste_of_tueday_saosin_2006/|access-date=2021-05-09|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Arrival of Cove Reber and ''Saosin EP'' (2004–2006)===
After the audition process and several guest vocalists on demos, the then 19-year-old [[Cove Reber]] was announced as their new permanent lead singer. Reber had sent in his demo tape, which was an acoustic demo with "[[Mookie's Last Christmas]]". The demo has since leaked onto the internet. It is widely speculated to have included a few songs from ''Translating the Name''. When Beau Burchell first heard the demo, he thought it was Anthony playing a trick on them, as Reber's vocal stylings were very similar to those of Green's when the demo was originally recorded.

In an interview with Euphonia Online, Reber commented that "everyone I've played with wants to make music their lives...Saosin is a band on a completely different level. All these dudes are freaks about music."<ref>{{cite web|title=Euphonia Online|url=https://www.euphoniaonline.net/interviews/CoveSaosin.html|work=New Singer Interview - Cove Reber (Saosin)|access-date=July 5, 2011}}</ref>

Reber's addition to the band was difficult, for the more experienced Green was the center piece of the band in the eyes of Saosin's fans. Many fans consider the time with Green to be something entirely different from the time with Reber. There are still distinct fans of both eras (Green Era/Reber Era) debating on which is a better fit for the band as a whole.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

Saosin played the first [[Taste of Chaos]] tour the following winter with [[The Used]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Killswitch Engage]], [[Senses Fail]] and [[A Static Lullaby|Static Lullaby]].<ref>{{Cite web|title='Taste Of Chaos' Takes Shape|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65588/taste-of-chaos-takes-shape-|access-date=2021-05-09|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref> Saosin was signed to [[Capitol Records]] in March and toured the United States with the [[Warped Tour]] for the second time. That summer, they released the ''[[Saosin EP]]''. At first it was intended to be a free sampler, but Capitol Records would not allow this and released it as an EP. It contained demo versions of songs later recorded on their first full-length album. A video to their new single "Bury Your Head" was filmed during the tour. The band continued touring for the rest of 2005, opening for [[Avenged Sevenfold]] and [[Coheed and Cambria]].

=== Saosin LP and Come Close (2006–2008) ===
After a respite from touring between February and June, the [[Warped Tour 2006]] and numerous demos and compilation appearances, Saosin released their first full-length album ''[[Saosin (album)|Saosin]]'' on September 26, 2006. The well-known music producer [[Howard Benson]] was hired for the production of the album. Benson had worked with several major rock bands such as [[My Chemical Romance]] and [[Blindside (band)|Blindside]]. The guitar riffs on the album were listed on [[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'s "Best Guitar Riffs of 2000s Rock."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Waldman|first=Scott|date=2020-06-22|title=Here are the 20 greatest guitar riffs from the 2000s|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/best-guitar-riffs-2000s-rock/|access-date=2021-05-09|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref> The first single, "Voices" was listed on the Top 46 [[post-hardcore]] songs of the 2000s, and the second single "You're Not Alone" was listed on the Top 10 Essential [[Emo]] Power Ballads by the [[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Magazine|first=Alternative Press|date=2020-02-10|title=Top 46 post-hardcore songs from the 2000s|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/best-post-hardcore-songs-2000s/|access-date=2021-05-09|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

During the rest of 2006, Saosin toured on the International [[Taste of Chaos]] Tour, playing their first shows outside of America. They also toured the United States with [[Bleeding Through]] and [[Senses Fail]]. They kept on touring for the whole year of 2007, beginning with a tour with [[Senses Fail]], [[Alexisonfire]], [[The Sleeping]] and [[Drop Dead, Gorgeous]]. Saosin also invited the non-profit organization [[Invisible Children]] for a portion of the tour. In February they joined the Taste of Chaos 2007 tour. Between April and June they toured in Europe, Australia, Japan and Indonesia.

When Saosin returned home they continued their headlining tour with [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]], [[The Receiving End of Sirens]], [[Fiore (music)|Fiore]] and [[Flight 409 (band)|Flight 409]]. In the later summer of 2007, they were part of [[Linkin Park]]'s [[Projekt Revolution]] tour.
After this they headlined yet another tour in USA and Canada with [[Alexisonfire]], [[Envy on the Coast]], [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]] and The Dear and Departed. Concert footage was recorded during the tour stop on November 3, 2007 at The Theater of Living Arts in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The concert footage was compiled for a live album and concert movie entitled ''[[Come Close (Saosin album)|Come Close]]''.

Saosin toured from January 26 to February 8, 2008 with [[Armor for Sleep]], [[Meriwether (band)|Meriwether]], and [[The Bled]]; from February 9 to 16 [[Fear Before]] joined the tour. They went to Australia between February and March, after which they performed in Singapore on March 7 as the opening performance for Incubus on their Light Grenades Tour. On their way home they also visited Bali, Hawaii and Mexico. After two final shows at home in California in April, they took a nine-month break from touring.

===The Grey EP and ''In Search of Solid Ground'' (2008–2010)===
Saosin returned to touring in October 2008 alongside [[Underoath]] and [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]].

In early 2009, they started recording a new album with producer [[Butch Walker]]. They partnered with [[Hurley International|Hurley]] to broadcast the recording process live on Hurley's website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hurley.com/saosin/ |title=Hurley Official Website.

Saosin released a new EP titled The Grey EP on October 14, 2008. The EP was sold on tour and on [[iTunes]] and featured three new demos, as well as an acoustic version of "Come Close".<ref>{{cite news |last=DeAndrea |first=Joe |url= http://absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=547921 |publisher=absolutepunk.net |title= Saosin: The Grey EP |date=September 15, 2008 |access-date=September 15, 2008}}</ref> The purpose of The Grey EP was to show demos they had been recording; a similar manner in which the ''[[Saosin EP]]'' contained demos for their debut LP.

Saosin released ''[[In Search of Solid Ground]]'' on September 8, 2009. Two songs were released as a download to anyone who bought a shirt, and a digital pre-order. The songs were "On My Own" and "Is This Real". These two songs were released as singles on iTunes August 4, 2009. On August 5 a new song titled "Changing" was made available for streaming on the internet. The single was then put up for download on iTunes August 11.

Three unreleased Saosin songs have leaked onto the internet through the Hurley Live Recording Stream they broadcast while recording ''In Search of Solid Ground''. Fans have titled them "The Norma Jean Song," "Back to Greatness" and the third is still known as "Untitled".

The band stated on Twitter that they have parted ways with Virgin records and are going back into a "DIY" direction.<ref name=backunsigned/>

===The departure of Cove Reber and inactivity (2010–2014)===
[[File:Saosin live on Projekt Revolution tour.jpg|thumb|280px|Saosin with [[Cove Reber]], live on [[Projekt Revolution]] Tour, in 2007]]
On July 21, 2010, guitarist Beau Burchell made the following announcement: <blockquote>"Well, a few days ago, Alex, Justin, Chris and I got back into the studio for our first group writing/jam session. We have all been writing things on our own, but it was cool to get into a room and play with loud amps all together again. I am very excited about this record, for a few different reasons. After 5 years with Cove, we have decided to part ways. So it will be a new experience for us, not knowing what to expect in the vocal dept, who will replace him, or if we will even find a replacement this century."<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Sean |url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2010/07/cove-reber-leaves-saosin.html |title=Cove Reber Leaves Saosin |publisher=Alter The Press! |date=2009-08-20 |access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref></blockquote> Reber was asked to leave due to his diminishing stage performance and vocal abilities. According to Justin Shekoski, "We didn't feel he could represent the music that we have recorded well on stage."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linescratchers.com/?p=1663 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318095017/http://www.linescratchers.com/?p=1663 |archive-date=2012-03-18 |title=It’s not easy being Cove Reber. @ Linescratchers |publisher=Linescratchers.com |date=February 21, 2011 |access-date=October 26, 2011}}</ref>

[[Cove Reber]] is now lead vocalist for the band Dead American. <blockquote>"finished Two NEW Songs, Instrumentals, ones called JUD JUD JUD. Lots of Riffs, Rolls and ROFLCOPTERS. Might put one up in a few days. STOKED! - Beau"<ref>{{cite web |last= Shotwell |first= James |title= Saosin speak about kicking out Cove |work= [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |date= August 12, 2010 |url= http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/saosin_speak_about_kicking_out_cove/ |access-date= August 12, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

On November 25, it was reported that Charles Furney, lead singer of [[Secret and Whisper]], had been recruited to fill Reber's abandoned vocalist spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strikegently.com/2010/11/25/saosin-select-new-lead-singer/ |title=Saosin Select New Lead Singer |publisher=Strike Gently |access-date=October 26, 2011}}</ref> One day later, on November 26, Saosin themselves denied these claims on their Facebook page:
<blockquote>''Thanks for the update from strike gently But, unfortunately, we DO NOT have a new singer yet, and its not Chris from Secret & Whisper. INFORMATION POLLUTION!- SAOSIN<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/saosin/posts/151104101602911 |title=Thanks for the... |publisher=Facebook |date=2010-11-26 |access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref></blockquote>
There has been speculation that [[Tides of Man]] vocalist, [[Tilian Pearson]], will audition for Saosin's vacant position. Pearson confirmed rumors that he was kicked out of [[Tides of Man]] due to him expressing an interest in pursuing the vacant lead vocalist role in Saosin. Justin Shekoski has also confirmed the speculation and clarified by saying: <blockquote>"Here's the truth, since I can't stand rumors. Tilian has been hitting us up. A lot. It looks like he wants the job pretty badly if he would quit his band. BUT....the REALITY is we haven't even met the guy in person. Everybody is talking about step No.&nbsp;54 (joining the band).<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Sean |url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2010/12/tilian-pearson-comments-on-tides-of-men.html |title=Tilian Pearson Comments on Tides of Men Departure and Interest In Joining Saosin |publisher=Alter The Press! |date=2009-08-20 |access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref></blockquote>

A new demo was leaked on the internet, fuelling speculation that Pearson had joined the band and begun recording. In an interview with Mind Equals Blown, Pearson revealed that the leaked demo is a track Saosin bassist Chris Sorenson had been working on, and that he was asked to provide vocals for it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mindequalsblown.net/2011/03/interview-tilian-pearson-emarosa-saosin-leak-demo/ |title=MEB Interview: Tilian Pearson |publisher=Mind Equals Blown |access-date=October 26, 2011}}</ref>

In an interview with Alternative Press, Pearson gave an update on his status with Saosin, and cleared up the rumor of him being an official Saosin member.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Sean |url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2011/06/tilian-pearson-comments-on-work-with.html |title=Tilian Pearson Comments on Work with Saosin and New Project |publisher=Alter The Press! |date=August 20, 2009 |access-date=October 26, 2011}}</ref> There were no further announcements of Pearson doing a record with Saosin, nor was there any announcement of him being added as an official member.

On February 23, 2012, the band's Twitter account confirmed that they were no longer in search of a new vocalist.

On November 18, 2012, Saosin tweeted a picture with the caption "Studio stuff #hewfring", dispelling rumours of the band's break-up which had begun to circulate due to their inactivity.

On December 16, 2012 Anthony Green was joined on stage by Beau and Justin for an encore where they played 'Seven Years'. Green stated it was the first time in nearly ten years that they had played together.

On February 21, 2013, Saosin updated their Facebook status "To satisfy those who wish to hear more about Saosin, We have written 14 songs. When they are ready, you will be the first to know."

A second Tilian Pearson-fronted demo, recorded over the instrumental originally released as a bonus track on the iTunes version of ISOSG entitled "Exfoliator," was posted to YouTube on May 7, 2013.

Anthony Green was interviewed by AltPress regarding his former group, Saosin, celebrating their ten-year anniversary of Translating The Name EP. In this particular segment, Green was asked if he would ever rejoin Saosin, he said "I love those songs and I love singing “Seven Years” when I play solo. I'm not opposed to talking about doing anything in the future. If the timing was right and it was for the right reasons, then I think it could be something really special".

On January 25, 2014, Beau Burchell tweeted a photo from Hurley Studios indicating that he was tracking drums with Alex Rodriguez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/jmUzuVOn3B/|title=beau burchell on Instagram: “Tracked this Frankenstein kit yesterday.
