'''Violadores del Verso''' ({{lang-es|Lyrical Molesters or Verse Rapists}}), also known as '''Doble V''', are a [[rap music]] crew from [[Zaragoza]], [[Spain]]. They used the name Doble V<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/violadores-del-verso-mn0002149821|title=Violadores del Verso|publisher=All Music|access-date=18 September 2014}}</ref> but were forced to return to their original long name due to legal issues (''Doble V'' is also the trademark of a Spanish whiskey). The band members are MCs Kase.O, Lírico, Sho-Hai (also known as Hate) and DJ R de Rumba. 

Violadores del Verso won the gold record for ''Vivir para contarlo'' (2006), and together with [[SFDK (band)|SFDK]] they are the only Spanish rap groups to have won a gold record to date.<ref>http://www.clubbingspain.com/phpBB/djs-y-grupos/violadores-del-verso-disco-de-oro-t40964.html</ref> Violadores del Verso are often considered the greatest [[Spain|Spanish]] hip hop group in history and one of the most influential Spanish-speaking hip hop artists of all time. 

The group has been on a long pause since 2010 as they wanted to grow separate careers and be creators on their own. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Violadores del Verso se toman una pausa para centrarse en sus proyectos en solitario {{!}} Tanaka Music|url=http://tanakamusic.com/2010/04/18/violadores-del-verso-se-toman-una-pausa-para-centrarse-en-sus-proyectos-en-solitario/|access-date=2021-04-14|language=es}}</ref> 

== Biography ==
Violadores del Verso started off in 1997 in Zaragoza, Spain.<ref name="Allmusic"/> They were initially 5 MC's, but Brutal (Kase.O's brother) left the group. 

In 1999 they published their first LP as a group, ''Genios'', which increased their popularity on the Spanish rap scene. They had legal problems with a whiskey company called Doble V, so they changed the name of the group back to their original name Violadores del Verso. 

In 2001 they published two more albums as Doble V. In 2006 they published "Vivir para contarlo", which is regarded as one of the best Spanish hip hop albums of all time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In 2019, the member Lírico was arrested for the aggression of a 27 year-old woman who he said was stalking him.
