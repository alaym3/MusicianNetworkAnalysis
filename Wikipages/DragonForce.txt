'''DragonForce''' are<!-- Per ENGVAR, British English uses the plural form of grammar when referring to certain organisations. See discussion on talk page for more info. --> a British [[power metal]] band from [[London]], England. The band was formed in 1999 by guitarists [[Herman Li]] and [[Sam Totman]], and are known for their long and fast [[guitar solo]]s, [[fantasy literature|fantasy]]-themed lyrics and [[video game music|retro video game-influenced sound]]. DragonForce's current lineup comprises Li, Totman, vocalist Marc Hudson and drummer Gee Anzalone. The band have been through a number of lineup changes throughout their career; longtime members in vocalist [[ZP Theart]], keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov, drummer [[Dave Mackintosh]] and bassist [[Frédéric Leclercq]] are among the former members of the band.

DragonForce have released eight studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one live DVD and one demo. Their third album, ''[[Inhuman Rampage]]'' (2006), was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI); its lead single, "[[Through the Fire and Flames]]", is their best-known song, and was featured in several [[video games]], including ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. The lead single from their fourth album, "[[Heroes of Our Time]]", was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2009.

DragonForce were founded in 1999 by guitarists [[Herman Li]] and [[Sam Totman]], under the name of '''DragonHeart'''. Totman and Li had both experienced being in a band previously, with both having come from the New Zealand [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Demoniac]]. The two later found vocalist [[ZP Theart]] through an advertisement,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-experience.com/interviews/dragonforce%20int.htm|title=Interview Dragonforce|website=Metal-experience.com}}</ref> and soon acquired former Demoniac drummer Matej Setinc, bassist Steve Scott and keyboardist [[Steve Williams (keyboardist)|Steve Williams]]. Setinc left the band in December 1999 to continue his studies in Slovenia, so the band hired Peter Hunt to record the drums for their demo album before finding Didier Almouzni. The band also parted ways with Scott, who left to join [[Shadowkeep]], in 2000. Williams took a small break then later rejoined the band as they recorded their first [[demo (music)|demo]] with [[Clive Nolan]] as a session member on the keyboards later that year, but left once again in December 2000, days ahead of the band's tour with [[Halford (band)|Halford]] and [[Stratovarius]] to promote the demo, and formed his own band, [[Power Quest]]. Bassist Diccon Harper joined the band in November that year, with keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov joining in February 2001 to complete the line-up for recording their debut [[album|studio album]].

Although it was an independent release, their demo was enough to make them one of the most popular independent power metal bands in the UK at the time. Their song "Valley of the Damned" was released as their debut single shortly after they changed their name permanently to DragonForce in 2002 (after finding out another power metal band already had the name DragonHeart). A promotional video featuring live footage from their tour around Europe was released along with the song. The song was also a huge success on [[MP3.com]] where it charted at No. 1 for 2 weeks as the most downloaded song. In 2002, the band signed to [[Noise Records]] and began recording their debut album, ''[[Valley of the Damned]]''. Harper performed the bass tracks for the album, but left the band in 2002 because of a [[tendon]] problem that required surgery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/hit_the_lights/dragonforce_live_playing_through_the_roof_since_having_in-ear_monitors.html |title=DragonForce: Live Playing 'Through the Roof' Since Having In-Ear Monitors |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002234730/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/hit_the_lights/dragonforce_live_playing_through_the_roof_since_having_in-ear_monitors.html |archive-date=2 October 2012  }}</ref> The title track, re-released in promotion of the album, is one of the best-known DragonForce songs to date and is a staple of their live performances to this day. The band's tour for ''Valley of the Damned'' lasted until 2004, with the tour ending in Tokyo, Japan.

DragonForce's second studio album, ''[[Sonic Firestorm]]'', proved to be even more successful than their previous album, with the help of the album's lead single, "Fury of the Storm". ''Sonic Firestorm'' was the first DragonForce album to feature new bassist [[Adrian Lambert]] and drummer [[Dave Mackintosh]]. When Mackintosh entered the band in 2004, they began referring to their style of music as "extreme power metal" due to his fast [[blast beats]] and double bass rhythms. The tour was longer than the band's previous tour for ''Valley of the Damned'', and featured many more headlining shows. The band toured with many well-known metal bands such as [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] and [[Iron Maiden]]. On the album, they also added a video commentary focusing on the making of ''Sonic Firestorm''.

===''Inhuman Rampage'' and ''Ultra Beatdown'' (2005–2009)===
[[File:DragonForce - VH45 (cropped).JPG|thumb|Herman Li, Frédéric Leclercq and Sam Totman performing in Melbourne in 2009]]
The band went [[mainstream]] with their third album, ''[[Inhuman Rampage]]'', which was released on 9 January 2006 after signing with [[Roadrunner Records]]. The first song on the album, "[[Through the Fire and Flames]]", is perhaps their most famous song to date, and is featured on the [[video games]] ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits]]'' and ''[[Brütal Legend]]'', and as downloadable content for the [[Rock Band|''Rock Band'' franchise]]. Former Demoniac frontman [[Lindsay Dawson (musician)|Lindsay Dawson]] appeared as a backing vocalist for the album. In November 2005, prior to the release of the album, Lambert left the band to raise his newborn son, and the band enlisted [[Frédéric Leclercq]] for the remainder of the ''Sonic Firestorm'' tour. Leclercq later became an official member of the band in January 2006 following the release of ''Inhuman Rampage'', and was also featured in the band's music video for their second single from the album, ''[[Operation Ground and Pound]]''. The "Through the Fire and Flames" single later reached gold status in USA and Canada.

DragonForce toured with [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] during the inaugural [[Mayhem Festival]] in 2008; the band then returned in autumn with the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[Ultra Beatdown]]''. The album's lead single, "[[Heroes of Our Time]]", was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] on 3 December 2008, eventually losing out to [[Metallica]] with their song "[[My Apocalypse]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx |title=The 51st Annual Grammy Awards Winner List |work=GRAMMY.com |publisher=The Recording Academy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102161757/http://www2.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/51st_show/list.aspx |archive-date=2 January 2010 |access-date=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> A short version of "Heroes Of Our Time" is also featured in the video game ''[[Skate 2]]'', and the full version in ''[[NHL 10]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/news/skate_2_and_skate_it_soundtracks_revealed.html |title=Skate 2 and Skate It soundtracks revealed |first=James |last=Orry |date=23 October 2008 |work=VideoGamer.com |publisher=Pro-G Media Ltd. |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205191843/http://www.videogamer.com/news/skate_2_and_skate_it_soundtracks_revealed.html |archive-date=5 February 2013 |access-date=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ea.com/music/the-official-nhl-10-soundtrack |title=The Official NHL 10 Soundtrack – EA Trax |work=EA.com |publisher=Electronic Arts Inc. |access-date=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324103935/http://www.ea.com/music/the-official-nhl-10-soundtrack |archive-date=24 March 2010  }}</ref> On 22 January 2009, the music video for their song "The Last Journey Home" was released to the [[Xbox Live]] Community a week before it was released online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonforce.com/df/news/dragonforce-video-world-premier-on-xbox-live |title=DragonForce Video World Premier on Xbox Live |website=DragonForce.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109174601/http://dragonforce.com/df/news/dragonforce-video-world-premier-on-xbox-live |archive-date=9 January 2010 |access-date=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The band carried out the ''Ultra Beatdown'' world tour in Europe, North America and South America. They were supposed to play in South America in May but the tour was postponed due to the [[swine flu]] outbreak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonforce.com/df/news/mexico-south-amercia-tour-dates-added |title=Mexico, South America Tour Dates Added |website=DragonForce.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430042945/http://www.dragonforce.com/df/news/mexico-south-amercia-tour-dates-added |archive-date=30 April 2009 |access-date=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name="Tour dates">{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonforce.com/tour/list-view |title=DragonForce Tour Schedule |website=DragonForce.com|access-date=10 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520054403/http://www.dragonforce.com/tour/list-view |archive-date=20 May 2009 }}</ref> They performed at the Two Days a Week Festival in Wiesen, Austria on 4 September, before performing in the United States and Canada from 15 September to 11 October, with special guests [[Sonata Arctica]] and [[Taking Dawn]].

They then travelled to South America to perform in [[Curitiba]], [[Porto Alegre]], São Paulo, [[Mexico City]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], Buenos Aires and [[Bogotá]] from 6–14 November.<ref name="Tour dates"/> The final part of the tour was carried out entirely in the UK from 19 November to 12 December.

===Departure of Theart and ''Twilight Dementia'' (2010–2011)===
Li stated in late 2009 that DragonForce would stop touring in December and spend Christmas at home, before beginning to write and record their next studio album in January.<ref name="Graspop">{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/hit_the_lights/dragonforce_live_playing_through_the_roof_since_having_in-ear_monitors.html |title=DragonForce: Live Playing 'Through The Roof' Since Having In-Ear Monitors |website=Ultimate-guitar.com |access-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002234730/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/hit_the_lights/dragonforce_live_playing_through_the_roof_since_having_in-ear_monitors.html |archive-date=2 October 2012  }}</ref> On 22 February 2010, the band re-released their first two albums, ''Valley of the Damned'' and ''Sonic Firestorm''. ''Valley of the Damned'' included newly remixed and remastered tracks while both albums included bonus tracks, updated packaging and DVDs featuring live footage, commentary and more. Both albums were also released in a box set which featured a T-shirt, a card of guitar picks, and an inflatable guitar.

On 8 March 2010, it was announced via the band's record label at the time, [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]], that Theart had parted ways with DragonForce due to "insurmountable differences of musical opinion", and that the band would be seeking a new frontman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espyrock.com/2010/03/dragonforce-part-ways-with-singer-9023/ |title=Updated: Dragonforce part ways with singer |website=Espyrock.com |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> The next day, the band released a press statement confirming the news and containing a link to request an audition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=136360 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET – DRAGONFORCE Confirms Singer's Departure |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208151205/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=136360 |archive-date=8 February 2012  }}</ref>

The band released their first [[live album]], ''[[Twilight Dementia]]'', on 13 September 2010, in Europe and 14 September 2010, in US and Canada. The album art, title, and release date were revealed on the band's official website on 22 June 2010.

{{bquote|For years, fans have been asking us to record a live album, but honestly, we never really had the time due to our worldwide touring commitments and studio album recording. However, due to the overwhelmingly positive feedback from fans on the ''Ultra Beatdown'' world tour, we decided to finally put some real thought into it...

These recordings really capture the raw sonic energy of a DragonForce show in fine detail. It is so real that you can hear the noise of the crowd and experience the show as it was that night – you can even hear the guitar pedals being stepped on!}}

The band then began working on their new studio album in early 2010, recording in various studios in California, London and the South of France. The band later confirmed that they would be the opening act for Iron Maiden in two UK shows in August 2011, with the first at [[Odyssey Arena]] in [[Belfast]] on 3 August and the second at [[The O2 Arena (London)|The O<sub>2</sub> Arena]] in London on 5 August. On 2 March 2011, DragonForce announced their new vocalist, Marc Hudson.<ref>

"We were flying out, playing a festival, then back into the studio, then back out again," said Leclercq, who handled majority of songwriting on the album. "It was very intense and very tiring... [I] lost my temper a few times – I think we all did at some point, because we wanted to deliver nothing but the best. I think we have proven that playing fast was something we were good at, so this time I wanted to bring even more diversity into our music.

A music video for "Ashes of the Dawn" was released on 15 May 2017. Keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov was not featured in the clip, nor in any of the shows happening by the time of the album's recording. In a video published in his official [[YouTube]] channel, he explained he wanted to have more time for his daughter and that due to contractual limitations, he had to choose between performing in all or none of the shows. He chose the second option and was absent from the album's promotional tour as well.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pruzhanov|first1=Vadim|title=Regarding my recent absence on tour with Dragonforce.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGPRMq2Ylhk| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428105344/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGPRMq2Ylhk&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=2020-04-28 | url-status=dead|website=Vadim Pruzhanov's official channel|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=25 May 2017|date=3 May 2017}}</ref> [[Power Quest]] supported DragonForce as special guests on the UK leg for the Reaching Into Infinity World Tour while supporting their own new album, ''Sixth Dimension''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.power-quest.co.uk/2016/index.php/404 |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927124003/http://www.power-quest.co.uk/2016/index.php/404 |archive-date=27 September 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 13 July, the band announced that Swedish act [[Twilight Force]] would support the band during the European leg of the ''Reaching Into Infinity World Tour''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dragonforce.com/2017/07/13/europe-tour-special-guest-confirmed-twilight-force/|title=EUROPE TOUR SPECIAL GUEST CONFIRMED: TWILIGHT FORCE|website=Dragonforce.com|date=13 July 2017}}</ref> A music video for "Midnight Madness" was released on 21 September 2017, which documented the making of that song at Fascination Street Studios.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Music Video – Midnight Madness|url=http://www.dragonforce.com/2017/09/21/new-music-video-midnight-madness/|website=Dragonforce.com|date=21 September 2017|access-date=7 October 2017}}</ref> On 15 October, they were announced to appear as a headlining band at [[Vagos Open Air]] in 2018, however on 20 January 2018, they issued a statement saying that they will not be attending due to "circumstances beyond their control".<ref>{{cite web|title=DragonForce regarding Vagos Open Air Festival|url=https://twitter.com/DragonForce/status/954564189934309376|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=20 January 2018|date=20 January 2018}}</ref> On 20 December, the band were announced to appear at Skogsröjet Festival in [[Rejmyre]], Sweden in August 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dragonforce.com/2017/12/20/sweden-rejmyre-skogsrojet-festival-2018/|title=SWEDEN, REJMYRE – SKOGSROJET FESTIVAL 2018|website=Dragonforce.com|date=20 December 2017}}</ref>

===Lineup changes and ''Extreme Power Metal'' (2018–2019)===
In January 2018, the band were announced to appear at Area 53 Festival in [[Leoben]], Austria in July,<ref>{{cite news|title=Area 53 Festival in Austria Confirmed|url=http://www.dragonforce.com/2018/01/21/area-53-festival-in-austria-confirmed/|website=Dragonforce.com|date=21 January 2018|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> and at [[Download Festival]]'s main stage for the first time since 2009 in June.<ref>{{cite news|title=Download Main Stage Confirmed|url=http://www.dragonforce.com/2018/01/24/download-main-stage-confirmed/|website=Dragonforce.com|date=24 January 2018|access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref> In April 2018, the band announced a remastered version of ''The Power Within'' called ''Re-Powered Within''. Li stated: "I love how ''Re-Powered Within'' has turned out. We remixed and remastered the original music with a more modern production, in the vein of our last two releases. The result is a clearer, more powerful sound. The fans will get to hear the music in better detail, bringing out parts they couldn't hear so well before, and injecting new excitement into the songs we love even more now."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dragonforce.com/2018/04/05/dragonforce-to-release-re-powered-within-on-may-4th-on-earmusic-fully-re-mixed-re-mastered-and-re-powered/|title=DRAGONFORCE TO RELEASE "RE-POWERED WITHIN" ON MAY 4TH ON earMUSIC.

===New live members and upcoming albums (2020–present)===

In January 2020, Alicia Vigil took over as the band's new touring bassist, beginning with their European tour.<ref name="replacements">{{cite news|title=DRAGONFORCE's GEE ANZALONE To Miss U.S. Tour; AQUILES PRIESTER To Step In|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dragonforces-gee-anzalone-to-miss-u-s-tour-aquiles-priester-to-step-in/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=2 March 2020|access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref> In March, Anzalone was admitted to hospital with [[myocarditis]] and was forced to skip DragonForce's United States tour, with [[Aquiles Priester]] replacing him for the tour<ref name="replacements"/> until it was cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="lockdown">{{cite news|title=DragonForce is using coronavirus downtime to work on new music|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dragonforce-is-using-coronavirus-downtime-to-work-on-new-music/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=12 April 2020|access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref> In April, Li said that the band had decided to use the lockdown time to write new music for "a new album which isn't going to be out for ages", while also saying that they were considering recruiting Vigil as their next permanent bassist.<ref name="lockdown"/>

While in quarantine, DragonForce have written and recorded parody songs in the style of bands like [[Rammstein]], [[Amon Amarth]], [[Blink-182]], and [[Nightwish]], along with a collaboration with [[Jaret Reddick]] from [[Bowling For Soup]]. In February 2021, the band announced that they would professionally record those songs and release them in an album later this year, before writing their next proper album.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dragonforce's Parody Album|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/news/42493/Dragonforces-Parody-Album/|work=[[Sputnikmusic]]|date=23 February 2021|access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
{{Listen|filename=DragonForce Soldiers of the Wasteland.ogg|title=Soldiers of the Wasteland (sample)|description=A brief sample of the sixth track from the ''[[Sonic Firestorm]]'' album.}}
Much of DragonForce's idiosyncratic style comes from the high-speed dual guitar sounds of [[Herman Li]] and [[Sam Totman]]. By playing at a high tempo within the upper registers of their instruments, their sound becomes similar to the "bleepy" arpeggios and quick pitch-bends normally associated with [[chiptune]], usually heard in the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] of [[video game music]]. The band often pays homage to this influence in their music videos.

Although the band has frequently referred to their style as [[power metal]], Li commented on descriptions of the band's style in an interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'': {{"'}}[[Nintendo]] metal', 'extreme power metal', '[[Bon Jovi]] on [[Amphetamine|speed]]', '[[Journey (band)|Journey]] meets [[Slayer]]', ... people are always coming up with weird labels for us."<ref>''[[Guitar World]]'', Holiday 2006, p. 72, "Hotter Than Hell"</ref> The band has also been labeled as a [[speed metal]] band.<ref>{{cite web |author=Paul Saitowitz |url=http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Ent_Guide_D_soundtracks.204707.html |title=Entertainment &#124; PE.com &#124; Southern California News &#124; News for Inland Southern California |website=PE.com |date=6 July 2006 |access-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211221329/http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Ent_Guide_D_soundtracks.204707.html |archive-date=11 February 2009  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/entertainment/music/hottickets/article_1223269.php |title=Entertainment – Juan Gabriel to play the Pond |website=Ocregister.com |access-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212225018/http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/entertainment/music/hottickets/article_1223269.php |archive-date=12 February 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Hot right now |url=http://www.gigwise.com/contents.asp?contentid=19752 |title=Friday 07/07/06 Ozzfest 2006, Main Stage @ The Cricket Pavilion, Phoenix Arizona |work=Gigwise |date=14 July 2006 |access-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718191955/http://www.gigwise.com/contents.asp?contentid=19752 |archive-date=18 July 2006  }}</ref>
