==History==
Two Steps from Hell was founded in early 2006 when Thomas Bergersen and Nick Phoenix joined forces to write original music for movie trailers. The two have composed music for over 1,000 major motion picture trailers.<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.twostepsfromhell.com/page2/index.html|publisher=Two Steps from Hell}}</ref>

With the founding of the company in 2006, Bergersen was looking for a name that would draw attention with the old adage in mind, "All PR is good PR." The idea for the name came from "Two Steps From Heaven",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.novinky.cz/kultura/clanek/hudebni-skladatel-thomas-bergersen-tihnu-k-dramaticke-hudbe-40306658|title=Hudební skladatel Thomas Bergersen: Tíhnu k dramatické hudbě - Novinky.cz|website=www.novinky.cz|access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref> a Norwegian nightclub that, according to Bergersen, had a similar theme going on.<ref>[https://issuu.com/burstmagazine/docs/burst_magazine_august_2013/42 Interview] with Thomas Bergersen and Nick Phoenix, Burst Magazine August 2013, S. 43.</ref>

Despite the company finding success with its music, the tracks were not officially released to the public until the May 2010 release of the commercial album ''[[Invincible (Two Steps from Hell album)|Invincible]]''. ''Invincible'' was approaching Gold record status.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} As of January 2017, Two Steps from Hell has published 10 public albums in addition to 20 demonstration albums, with almost 1,000 unique tracks in total.

''Invincible'' was followed by Bergersen's first solo album, ''[[Illusions (Thomas Bergersen album)|Illusions]]'', then [[Archangel (Two Steps from Hell album)|''Archangel'']] and ''[[Halloween (Two Steps from Hell album)|Halloween]]'', both primarily compilation albums of industry tracks. Next, ''[[SkyWorld]]'' was released as the first public album to feature mostly new tracks, followed by the primarily compilation albums ''[[Classics Volume One (Two Steps From Hell album)|Classics Volume One]]'' and ''[[Miracles (Two Steps from Hell album)|Miracles]]''.

In 2013 Nick Phoenix released his only solo album to date, ''[[Speed of Sound (Nick Phoenix album)|Speed of Sound]].''
