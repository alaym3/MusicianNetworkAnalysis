==Reception==
''[[The Economist]]'' said of Tempest's commission from the Royal Shakespeare Company: "A stunning piece by [Kae] Tempest, a London-born performance poet, comes bursting off the screen. Rarely has the relevance of Shakespeare to our language, to the very fabric of our feelings, been expressed with quite such youthful passion. (It should be mandatory viewing for all teenagers.)"<ref name="Economist">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2012/08/william-shakespeare|title=William Shakespeare: A digital reinvention |date=28 August 2012|publisher=[[The Economist]] |access-date=15 September 2012}}</ref> The ''[[Huffington Post]]'' describes them as "Britain's leading young poet, playwright and rapper...one of the most widely respected performers in the country – the complete package of lyrics and delivery. [They are] also one of the most exciting young writers working in Britain today" (2012). ''The Guardian'' commented of ''Brand New Ancients'', "Suddenly it feels as if we are not in a theatre but a church... gathered around a hearth, hearing the age-old stories that help us make sense of our lives. We're given the sense that what we are watching is something sacred."<ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/10/brand-new-ancients-review?INTCMP=SRCH|title= Brand New Ancients – review BAC, London|last=Gardner |first=Lyn|date= 10 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=15 September 2012}}</ref> In 2013, the newspaper noted:

<blockquote>
[They are] one of the brightest talents around. [Their] spoken-word performances have the metre and craft of traditional poetry, the kinetic agitation of hip-hop and the intimacy of a whispered heart-to-heart... Tempest deals bravely with poverty, class and consumerism. [They do] so in a way that not only avoids the pitfalls of sounding trite, but manages to be beautiful too, drawing on ancient mythology and sermonic cadence to tell stories of the everyday.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/10/kate-tempest-performance-poet-cant-be-ignored "Kate Tempest: the performance poet who can't be ignored"] 10 April 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>
</blockquote>

In 2013, they won the [[Ted Hughes Award]] for their work ''Brand New Ancients'', the first person under the age of 40 to win the award,<ref name="Auto">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/sep/14/kate-tempest-poet-rapper-mercury-prize-profile|title=Kate Tempest: a winning wielder of words|author=Michael Hogan|work=The Guardian|date=14 September 2014}}</ref> and was selected as one of the 2014 Next Generation Poets by the [[Poetry Society]].<ref name="auto2">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/11/next-generation-20-poets-poetry-book-society-kate-tempest|work=The Guardian|title='Next Generation' of 20 hotly-tipped poets announced by Poetry Book Society|date=11 September 2014|author=Alison Flood}}</ref>

Tempest has received wide critical acclaim for their written and live work.<ref name="Economist"/> A performance of ''Brand New Ancients'' prompted the New York Times to say “As gorgeous streams of words flow out, [they conjure] a story so vivid it’s as if you had a state-of-the-art Blu-ray player stuffed into your brain, projecting image after image that sears itself into your consciousness”<ref name="Isherwood" /> while a review by Michiko Kakutani of their poetry collections in the same paper explored their written style: “While [their] intense performances on stage add a fierce urgency to the words, these text versions of [their] work stand powerfully on their own on the page...using [their] pictorial imagination to sear specific images into the reader’s mind”.<ref name="Kakutani" />

They have been published in nine languages.

''Everybody Down'' was nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize and ''Let Them Eat Chaos'' have been nominated for the 2017 Mercury Music Prize. Their accompanying poetry book ''Let Them Eat Chaos'' was nominated for the Costa Book of the Year in the Poetry Category in 2016. They were nominated as [[Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist|Best Female Solo Performer]] at the 2018 Brit Awards.
