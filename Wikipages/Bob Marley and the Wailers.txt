'''Bob Marley and the Wailers''' (also known as '''Bob Marley & the Wailers''' or '''The Wailers''') were a Jamaican [[reggae]] band led by [[Bob Marley]]. It developed from the earlier [[ska]] vocal group, '''The Wailers''', created by  [[Peter Tosh]], Marley, and [[Bunny Wailer]] in 1963. By late 1963 singers [[Junior Braithwaite]], [[Beverley Kelso]], and [[Cherry Smith]] had joined on. By the early 1970s, Marley and Bunny Wailer had learned to play some instruments, and brothers [[Aston Barrett|Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] (bass) and [[Carlton Barrett]] (drums), had joined the band. After Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh left the band in 1974, Marley began touring with new band members as Bob Marley and the Wailers. His new [[Backup band|backing band]] included the Barrett brothers, [[Junior Marvin]] and [[Al Anderson (The Wailers)|Al Anderson]] on lead guitar, [[Tyrone Downie]] and [[Earl Lindo|Earl "Wya" Lindo]] on keyboards, and [[Alvin "Seeco" Patterson]] on percussion. The [[#I Three|"I Threes"]], consisting of [[Judy Mowatt]], [[Marcia Griffiths]], and Marley's wife, [[Rita Marley|Rita]], provided backing vocals.

==History==
The Wailers were formed when self-taught musician Hubert Winston McIntosh ([[Peter Tosh]]) met the singers Neville Livingston ([[Bunny Wailer]]), and Robert Nesta Marley ([[Bob Marley]]) in 1963.

===Early years===
The lineup was known variously as the Teenagers, the Wailing Rudeboys, the Wailing Wailers and finally just the Wailers. The original lineup featured [[Junior Braithwaite]] on vocals, [[Bob Marley]] on guitar, [[Peter Tosh]] on keyboard, [[Bunny Wailer]] on percussion, and [[Cherry Smith]] and [[Beverley Kelso]] on backing vocals. By 1966 Braithwaite, Kelso and Smith had left the band, which then consisted of the trio Livingston, Marley and Tosh.

In 1964, the Wailers topped the Jamaican charts with "[[Simmer Down]]", which was recorded 1963 at Studio One with the rhythm section from studio house band [[The Skatalites]]. Some of the Wailers' most notable songs were recorded with [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] and his studio band [[the Upsetters]]. The Wailers also worked with renowned [[reggae]] producer [[Leslie Kong]], who used his studio musicians called Beverley's All-Stars ([[Jackie Jackson (bassist)|Jackie Jackson]], [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]], [[Gladstone Anderson]], [[Winston Wright]], Rad Bryan, [[Hux Brown]]) to record the songs that would be released as an album titled ''[[The Best of The Wailers]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Moskowitz, David V.|title= "Rebel Music, 1970–1975."

In 1966, they created a [[rocksteady]] [[record label]], the [[Wail N Soul M]].<ref name="rym">{{cite web|title=Wail'n Soul'm|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/label/wailn_soulm/|website=[[Rate Your Music]]|access-date=5 August 2017}}</ref>

During the early 1970s the Upsetters members [[Aston Barrett|Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] and his brother [[Carlton Barrett|Carlton (Carly) Barrett]],<ref>[http://www.uncarved.org/dub/scratch.html Lee Scratch Perry Interview], ''New Musical Express'', 17 November 1984</ref> were recruited as instrumental backing for The Wailers. The Wailers recorded groundbreaking ska and reggae songs such as "Simmer Down", "Trenchtown Rock", "Nice Time", "[[War (Bob Marley song)|War]]", "[[Stir It Up]]" and "[[Get Up, Stand Up]]". An attempt at creating a full overview of all the music made by The Wailers prior to their signing to [[Island Records]] was made by the [[Roots Reggae Library]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.roots-reggae-library.com/2013/03/the-wailers.html|title = The Wailers|access-date = 8 January 2015|website = roots-reggae-library.com|last = de Vries|first = Anton E. (2013)}}</ref>

===Line-up changes===
The original Wailers line-up disbanded in 1974 due to Tosh and Livingston's refusal to play "freak clubs". The pair believed doing so would violate their [[Rastafarian]] faith.<ref>(Marley 2012 by Magnolia Films)</ref> Bob Marley formed Bob Marley and the Wailers with himself as guitarist, songwriter, and main singer, the Wailers Band as the backing band, and the I Three as backup vocalists. The Wailers Band included the brothers Carlton Barrett and "Family Man" Barrett on drums and bass respectively, [[Junior Marvin]] and [[Al Anderson (Wailers)|Al Anderson]] playing lead guitar, [[Tyrone Downie]] and [[Earl Lindo|Earl "Wya" Lindo]] playing keyboard, and [[Alvin Patterson|Alvin "Seeco" Patterson]] playing percussion. The I Three consisted of Bob Marley's wife [[Rita Marley]], [[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Marcia Griffiths]].

Peter Tosh believed that producer [[Chris Blackwell]], whom he called "Chris Whiteworst", was responsible for the bad relationship between the band members, as he thought Blackwell released their albums under "Bob Marley and the Wailers" instead of "the Wailers" since 1969, which tested their friendship. Perry released two compilation albums for [[Trojan Records]] in 1974, ''[[Rasta Revolution]]'' and ''[[African Herbsman]]'', which contained songs from ''[[Soul Rebels]]'' and ''[[Soul Revolution]]'', respectively, and he was the copyright holder of several songs from these albums.<ref name=white222>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=h4nfr2cYAMQC |title=Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley |pages=222–223 |author=Timothy White |publisher=Henry Holt|date= 2 May 2006 |isbn=9780805080865 |access-date=17 May 2012}}</ref> These changes caused a major dispute between Marley and Perry, when the former saw the albums, six months after their publication, in the Half Way Road in England.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=h4nfr2cYAMQC |title=Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley |page=224 |author=Timothy White |publisher=Henry Holt|date= 2 May 2006 |isbn=9780805080865 |access-date=17 May 2012}}</ref>

===Later years===
Bob Marley and the Wailers, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer all enjoyed considerable success as reggae music continued to gain popularity during the 1970s and 1980s. One of the last performances that included Marley was in 1980 at Madison Square Garden. Several of the group's members have died subsequent to Marley's death in 1981: Carlton Barrett and Tosh (both murdered) in 1987, Braithwaite (also murdered) in 1999, Smith in 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2008/10/12/cherry_1013.html?imw=Y |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-10-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715043416/http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2008/10/12/cherry_1013.html?imw=Y |archive-date=15 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Earl Lindo in 2017,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iriefm.net/earl-wyaa-lindo-dies-64/|title=Earl "Wyaa" Lindo dies at 64|publisher=IrieFm.net|date=5 September 2017|access-date=6 September 2017}}</ref> and Wailer in 2021. [[Beverley Kelso]], Constantine "Dream" Walker and [[Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] are the only surviving members of the group's original line-up.

==I Three==
{{anchor|I Threes}}
[[Image:Bob Marley I Threes.jpg|thumb|The I Three from left to right: Judy Mowatt, Rita Marley, and Marcia Griffiths]]

The I Three, commonly called I Threes, were formed in 1974 to support Bob Marley and the Wailers after [[Peter Tosh]] and [[Bunny Wailer]] – the original Wailer backing vocalists – left the band.

The three members were Marley's wife [[Rita Marley]], [[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Marcia Griffiths]].<ref name="Harris">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p39481/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: I-Threes|last=Harris|first=Craig|website=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=24 July 2010}}</ref> Their name is intended as a spin on the [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] "[[Iyaric#I words|I and I]]" concept of the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]] within each person.
