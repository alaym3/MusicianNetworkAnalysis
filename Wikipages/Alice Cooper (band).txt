'''Alice Cooper''' (also known as The Alice Cooper Group, or The Alice Cooper Band) was an American rock band formed in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], in 1964. The band consisted of lead singer Vince Furnier (stage name [[Alice Cooper]]), [[Glen Buxton]] (lead guitar), [[Michael Bruce (musician)|Michael Bruce]] (rhythm guitar, keyboards), [[Dennis Dunaway]] (bass guitar), and [[Neal Smith (drummer)|Neal Smith]] (drums). Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and has had a solo career under that name since the band became inactive in 1975. The band was notorious for their elaborate, theatrical [[shock rock]] stage shows.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waksman|first=Steve|title=This Ain't the Summer of Love: Conflict and Crossover in Heavy Metal and Punk|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqDJjAeYxssC|year=2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94388-9|page=76}}</ref> In 2011, the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=HallofFame>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundspike.com/news/article/1239-rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_news_rock_hall_makes_it_official_alice.html |title=Rock Hall makes it official: Alice Cooper, Neil Diamond among new class |publisher=SoundSpike |date=December 15, 2010 |access-date=December 17, 2010}}</ref>

After years of obscurity, the Alice Cooper band rose to fame in 1971 with the [[hit single]] "[[I'm Eighteen]]" and the album ''[[Love It to Death]]''. Success continued with the popular single "[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]" and the [[School's Out (album)|album of the same name]] in 1972. The band peaked in popularity in 1973 with their next album ''[[Billion Dollar Babies]]'' and its tour, which broke box-office records previously held by [[The Rolling Stones]].

In 1964, 16-year-old Furnier, then a student at Cortez High School, was eager to participate in the local annual [[Letterman (sports)|Letterman's]] talent show, so he gathered four teammates from his high school's [[cross-country running|cross-country]] team to form a group for the show: [[Glen Buxton]], [[Dennis Dunaway]], John Tatum and John Speer.<ref>Cooper describes in detail in his first autobiography, ''Me, Alice'', how he was tasked with organizing an act for the show.</ref> They named themselves The Earwigs.<ref name=superduper>Harkima, Reginald, Scott McFayden and Sam Dunn, dir. Super Duper Alice Cooper. Banger Films, 2014. DVD.</ref> They dressed up in costumes and wigs to resemble [[the Beatles]], and performed several parodies of Beatles songs, with the lyrics modified to refer to the track team: in their rendition of "[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]", for example, the line "Last night I said these words to my girl" was replaced with "Last night I ran four laps for my coach".<ref>{{cite news |title=Alice Cooper bandmates reflect on their historic past |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/06/06/alice-cooper-band-interviews-history/28625657/ |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |first=Ed |last=Masley |date=June 6, 2015}}</ref> Of the group, only Buxton and Tatum knew how to play an instrument—the guitar—so Buxton and Tatum played guitars while the rest mimed on their instruments.<ref name="rock lifestyle">{{cite news |title=Rock lifestyle caught up with Cooper guitarist Glen Buxton |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/20110308alice-cooper-glen-buxton.html |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |date=October 1999 |first=Larry |last=Rodgers}}</ref> The group got an overwhelming response from the audience and won the talent show. As a result of their positive experience, the group decided to try to turn into a real band. They acquired musical instruments from a local [[pawn shop]], and proceeded to learn how to play them, with Buxton doing most of the teaching, as well as much of the early songwriting.<ref name="rock lifestyle" /> They soon renamed themselves The Spiders, featuring Furnier on vocals, Buxton on lead guitar, Tatum on rhythm guitar, Dunaway on bass guitar, and Speer on drums.<ref name=superduper /> Musically, the group was inspired by artists such as the Beatles, [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Who]], [[the Kinks]], [[the Doors]], and [[the Yardbirds]]. For the next year the band performed regularly around the Phoenix area with a huge black spider's web as their backdrop, the group's first stage prop.<ref name=superduper />

In 1965, the Spiders recorded their first single, "Why Don't You Love Me" (originally performed by the Blackwells), with Furnier learning the harmonica for the song.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The single's B-side track was the [[Marvin Gaye]] [[Tamla Records]] hit, "[[Hitch Hike (song)|Hitch Hike]]". The single was released by local record label, Mascot Records, owned by Jack Curtis, a concert promoter who also owned the Stage 7 teen club which later became the VIP Club where the Spiders were the house band. At the VIP Club the band supported other bands including – [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], the Yardbirds, [[Them (band)|Them]], [[the Animals]], the Kinks and [[the Byrds]].<ref>Alice Cooper Golf Monster (2007) ISBN 978 1 84513 358 0 p36</ref>

In 1966, the Spiders graduated from high school and after [[North High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|North High School]] footballer [[Michael Owen Bruce|Michael Bruce]] replaced John Tatum on rhythm guitar, the band released their second single, "Don't Blow Your Mind", an original composition which became a local #1 hit, backed by "No Price Tag". The single was recorded at Copper State Recording Studio and issued by local micro-imprint, Santa Cruz Records.<ref name=superduper />

By 1967, the band had begun to make regular road trips to Los Angeles to play shows. They soon renamed themselves Nazz and released the single "Wonder Who's Lovin' Her Now", backed with future Alice Cooper track "Lay Down and Die, Goodbye". At around this time, drummer John Speer was replaced by [[Neal Smith (drummer)|Neal Smith]]. By the end of the year, the band had relocated to Los Angeles.<ref name=superduper /> For a while the band lived in the same house with the [[Syd Barrett]] line-up of [[Pink Floyd]]. This was on Beethoven Street, Venice, Los Angeles.<ref>Alice Cooper Golf Monster (2007) ISBN 978 1 84513 358 0 p59</ref> In Los Angeles, the band's lifestyle involved regular car trips into the desert. Activities included shooting rabbits with a 0.22 rifle. In 1967, Neal Smith moved into the range of Cooper's rifle as Alice was about to fire. Smith was hit in the ankle. He has the fragment in his ankle to this day.<ref>Alice Cooper Golf Monster (2007) {{ISBN|978 1 84513 358 0}} p39-41</ref> Around this time, the band and three others were driving in Los Angeles in a van. An incident on the road caused the driver to lose control of the van and it went off the road rolling over four times. The van was destroyed, but all band members and the three other passengers survived without serious injury.<ref>Alice Cooper Golf Monster (2007) {{ISBN|978 1 84513 358 0}} p55-56</ref>

In 1968, the band learned that [[Todd Rundgren]] also had a band called [[Nazz]], and found themselves in need of another stage name. Furnier also believed that the group needed a [[gimmick]] to succeed, and that other bands were not exploiting the showmanship potential of the stage.<ref name=superduper /> The legend is that the name "Alice Cooper" came from a session with a [[Ouija|Ouija board]], largely chosen because it sounded innocuous and wholesome, in humorous contrast to the band's image and music. However, in an interview with [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] on the [[Radcliffe and Maconie]] show on [[BBC Radio 2]] on 30 November 2009 Alice described the incident with the ouija board as an [[urban legend]]. He said "We literally got that whole story about the witch thing the way you guys got it. It was like just pure urban legend. I heard about the witch thing probably the same day you did, but it was a great story."<ref name="auto">"[[The Radcliffe and Maconie Show]]." Guest Alice Cooper. BBC Radio 2. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p36ry Episode 30 November 2009].</ref> Eventually Furnier adopted this stage name as his own. He later stated that the name change was one of his most important and successful career moves.<ref name="auto1"/> The classic Alice Cooper group [[Band (music)|line-up]] consisted of Furnier, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, rhythm guitarist Michael Bruce, bassist Dennis Dunaway and drummer Neal Smith – all former members of the Spiders. This lineup stayed intact through 1974.<ref name=superduper /><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGJ7XmA8rjIC&pg=PA188 |title=History of Rock and Roll |author=Tom Larson |year=2004 |page=188 |isbn=9780787299699 |via=[[Google Books]]|access-date=2015-10-13}}</ref>

The band's first gig that used the name Alice Cooper was on March 16, 1968 at Earl Warren Fairgrounds in Santa Barbara. The posters still showed the band as The Nazz.<ref>Alice Cooper Golf Monster (2007) {{ISBN|978 1 84513 358 0}} p57</ref> After a 1968 gig at the Cheetah club in [[Venice, California]], where most of the club's patrons left after hearing the band play just ten minutes, they were approached by [[music manager]] [[Shep Gordon]], who saw the band's negative impact that night as a force that could be turned in a more productive direction.<ref name="Harkima">''Super Duper Alice Cooper.'' Dir. Reginald Harkima, Scott McFayden, and Sam Dunn. Banger Films in association with Eagle Rock Entertainment, the Movie Network, and Movie Central. 2014 – documentary</ref> Shep arranged an audition for the band with renowned musical artist and record producer [[Frank Zappa]], who was looking to sign bizarre music acts to his new record label, [[Straight Records]]. Zappa told them to come to his house "at 7 o'clock" for an audition. The band mistakenly assumed he meant 7 o'clock in the morning. Being woken up by a band willing to play that particular brand of music at seven in the morning impressed Zappa enough for him to sign them to a three-album deal.<ref name="Harkima"/> "Frank was the only one who stuck out his neck for us, for me," recalled Alice himself. "He was the one who said, 'Here's a band that everybody in the business is laughing at – I like 'em.' … He was the outcast in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] and so were we."<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|title=Alice Cooper|date=March 2002}}</ref> The first three Alice Cooper albums were released on Zappa's Straight label.

Another Zappa-signed act, the all-female [[The GTOs|GTOs]], were encouraged to dress up the Alice Cooper band members in women's clothing and heavy makeup, and played a major role in developing the band's early onstage look.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/people/p-christine.php |title=Miss Christine |work=SickthingsUK |date=November 5, 1972 |access-date=April 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420085327/http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/people/p-christine.php |archive-date=April 20, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band was the subject of media criticism after Furnier threw a live chicken into the audience during the 1969 [[Toronto]] Rock 'n' Roll Revival Festival. The audience ripped the chicken, whose name was Dutchess, to shreds.<ref name=star20140424>Howell, Peter. "Toronto 'chicken incident' sparked rage". ''Toronto Star'', 24 April 2014.</ref> In 1970, the band appeared on a Warner Bros sampler album, ''Zapped'', featuring acts produced by Zappa.

===Finding success===
Slow sales of the band's first two albums, as well as Californians' indifference to their act, led the band to relocate again in 1970, this time to [[Pontiac, Michigan]] near Furnier's original home town of [[Detroit]]. Here, their bizarre stage act was much better received by [[Midwest]]ern crowds accustomed to the [[proto punk]] styles of local bands such as [[the Stooges]] and [[the MC5]]. "L.A. just didn’t get it," Furnier stated. "They were all on the wrong drug for us. They were on acid and we were basically drinking beer. We fit much more in Detroit than we did anywhere else."<ref name="metrotimes">{{cite news |url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=5479 |date=October 8, 2003 |title=Alice doesn't live here anymore.

Hooking up with young producer [[Bob Ezrin]], Alice Cooper released the single "I'm Eighteen" in late 1970, and it became a surprise Top 40 hit. The single's success convinced Warner Bros that the band could be a viable commercial act, leading to much stronger investment in the third Alice Cooper album, ''[[Love It to Death]]''. The album was initially released on Straight Records, but was reissued on the Warner label following its buyout of the imprint from Zappa, giving Alice Cooper even greater exposure. Under Ezrin's direction, the band's sound moved from psychedelic rock to a tighter, guitar-driven [[hard rock]] sound, even as much of the lyrical content continued to explore "decadence, perversion and psychosis."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Alice-Cooper-American-rock-band |title=Alice Cooper – American Rock Group|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=May 15, 2019}}</ref>

In 1971 the band was doing its first headliner tour. Backstage at a gig in Florida, a young woman came in with a Boa Constrictor coiled around her arm. This gave Alice a fright, and after experiencing this kind of reaction, the idea of using a snake in the stage performance began.<ref>Alice Cooper Golf Monster (2007) ISBN 978 1 84513 358 0 p83</ref> With ''Love It to Death'' and its follow-up album ''[[Killer (Alice Cooper album)|Killer]]'' both charting well, the band was able to afford a more elaborate stage show, including sophisticated props and elements of gothic horror, and they became a highly popular concert attraction in the US and UK over the next few years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/alice-cooper-mn0000005953/biography|title=Artist Biography – Alice Cooper|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Earlwine |work=allmusic|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref> Calls by members of British Parliament in 1972 to have the group banned from performing in the UK only solidified the band's legend,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alicecooperechive.com/articles/feature/alis/011019 |title=Loads More Mr Nice Guy |work=Alice Cooper eChive |date=October 19, 2001 |access-date=April 8, 2012}}</ref> and the next year's ''[[Billion Dollar Babies]]'' tour broke box office records.

Following ''Killer'', Alice Cooper released three more top ten albums, the pinnacle being 1973's ''Billion Dollar Babies'' which rose all the way to No. 1 on the US and UK album charts. The band headlined highly successful tours from 1972 to 1974, before breaking up. The band made so much money in 1973 and 1974 that Alice appeared on the cover of Forbes Magazine in 1974.<ref>Alice Cooper Golf Monster (2007) ISBN 978 1 84513 358 0 p111</ref>

===Breakup of the original band===
The original Alice Cooper band played their final show on April 8, 1974 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Billion Dollar Babies Gigography |url=https://alicecooperechive.com/gigography/billion-dollar-babies |website=alicecooperechive.com |access-date=December 6, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> There are varying reasons former band members have given for the breakup. Smith said the members wanted to take a year off to slow down and possibly do solo projects, and just never reunited. Cooper said there was disagreement over how much money to sink back into stage shows, which had become costly. Bruce contends that Buxton's issues with substance abuse, which at one time led him to pull a switchblade on the band's tour manager, likely hastened the breakup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2011/03/08/20110308alice-cooper-glen-buxton.html |title=Rock lifestyle caught up with Cooper guitarist Glen Buxton |first=Larry |last=Rodgers |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |date=March 8, 2011 |access-date=April 20, 2018}}</ref>

Bruce, Dunaway and Smith would go on to form the short-lived band '''Billion Dollar Babies''', producing one album – ''Battle Axe'' – in 1977. While occasionally performing with one another and [[Glen Buxton]], they would not reunite with Alice until October 23, 1999, at the second Glen Buxton Memorial Weekend for a show at CoopersTown in Phoenix (Buxton having died in 1997). They reunited for another show, with [[Steve Hunter]] on guitar, on December 16, 2010, at the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxuPXFuhBSQ |title=Alice Cooper – Dennis Dunaway Interview |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2011-10-30 |access-date=2015-04-15}}</ref> This lineup would perform together again (televised) on March 14, 2011, at the induction of the original Alice Cooper group into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], as well as on May 11, 2011, at London's [[Battersea Power Station]] at the [[Jägermeister]] Ice Cold 4D event (webcast). Bruce, Dunaway and Smith appeared on three tracks they co-wrote on Alice's 2011 album ''[[Welcome 2 My Nightmare]]''.

A documentary about the band entitled ''[[Super Duper Alice Cooper]]'' premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 17, 2014, and was scheduled to be screened at the [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]] a week later.<ref name=star20140424 />
