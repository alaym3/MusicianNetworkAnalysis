== Career ==
The duo's first U.S. single and release was "DJ Interview", appearing on World to World, which later got them a recording contract with [[Profile Records]] in 1987. The duo was assisted by a long time friend from New Jersey, producer David Wynn. David Wynn produced three songs on their debut album and five songs on their sophomore album.

The first Profile release was "[[It Takes Two (Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock song)|It Takes Two]]".<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|pages=287/8}}</ref> It used multiple samples from the [[James Brown]] and [[Lyn Collins]] 1972 song "[[Think (About It)]]".<ref name="LarkinDM" /> The track first became a regional hit and then slowly climbed the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], picking up a multi-platinum single certification. The song also peaked at No. 3 on the [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart.

An album, also called ''[[It Takes Two (album)|It Takes Two]]'', was quickly put together and it produced a significant follow-up hit, "Joy and Pain", which sampled a song of the same name by [[Maze (band)|Maze]] featuring [[Frankie Beverly]], as well as "Put the Music Where Your Mouth Is" by [[The Olympic Runners]].<ref name="LarkinDM" /> It also hit the top 10 on the dance chart and climbed to No. 58 on the Hot 100. "Get On the Dance Floor", produced by David Wynn (DJ Wynn), a track released to clubs in between the two singles, hit No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. Boosted by those singles, the ''It Takes Two'' album went platinum seven times over.

Base responded in 1989 with ''[[The Incredible Base]]'', his debut solo album.<ref name="LarkinDM" /> It did not sell as well as ''It Takes Two''.<ref name="LarkinDM" /> One song from the album hit the dance chart in late 1989: "Turn It Out (Go Base)", credited only to Rob Base.

In 2008, their song "It Takes Two" was ranked number 37 on [[VH1]]'s 100 greatest songs of hip hop.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Macnie |url=http://blog.vh1.com/2008-09-24/100-greatest-hip-hop-songs/ |title= VH1′s 100 Greatest Hip Hop Songs Ever |publisher=VH1 |date=September 24, 2008 |access-date=August 18, 2014}}</ref>
