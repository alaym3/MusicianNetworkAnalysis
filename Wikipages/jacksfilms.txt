'''John Patrick Douglass''' (born June 30, 1988), known online as '''jacksfilms''', is an American [[YouTuber]]. Douglass began his online career in 2006. His YouTube channel initially consisted of [[infomercial]] parodies, sketches, and comedic music videos. As his audience grew, he expanded into comedy series centered around viewer comments and submissions, such as ''Your Grammar Sucks'' (''YGS''), in which he makes fun of incorrect grammar; ''JackAsk'', in which he answered questions about himself (often satirically); and ''Yesterday I Asked You'' (''YIAY'' {{IPAc-en|j|aɪ}}), initially a segment at the end of JackAsk, which later became a standalone series, in which he asks questions to his audience, and they give answers for him to react to. In October 2020, Douglass announced the end of YGS and JackAsk,<ref name=":0">{{Cite tweet|number=1320459048358010880|user=jacksfilms|title=I know a lot of you are concerned about me ending YGS and JackAsk, but I promise it's for the best - these shows feel like obligations at this point, and they're holding me back from creating genuinely fresh stuff. Think of this as a big fat reset button|author=Jack Douglass|date=October 25, 2020|access-date=October 25, 2020}}</ref> though he later revived those series by presenting them in a blind, unscripted format.

Douglass also does occasional livestreams on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], where he has two shows on the platform: ''YIAY Live'' and its spinoff, ''Are You Funnier Than A YouTuber?''

== Early life and education ==
Douglass was born in [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], [[Maryland]], on June 30, 1988, and is primarily of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite AV media|last=Douglass|first=Jack|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcwGLjl2W_s|title=The CLICKBAIT Game (YIAY #304) |work=jacksfilms|via=[[YouTube]]|date=January 13, 2017|access-date=January 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|last=Douglass|first=Jack|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZMIc3w-Llc|title=My Apology|work=jacksfilms|via=[[YouTube]]|date=May 1, 2017|access-date=July 19, 2017}}</ref> He has two older sisters. Douglass went to school in Maryland. During high school, he started to develop a love for music. He then began to play the [[French horn]] as well as the [[piano]].

In May 2006, during his senior year of high school, he was given the task of making a video about all the books he had read during the year. He and his friends decided to film a series of short videos that made fun of books such as ''Beowulf'' and ''All the King's Men''. After making these sketches, he decided that he wanted to make films to a greater extent. By the next month, he had begun using YouTube and had started to upload videos.<ref>{{cite AV media|last=Douglass|first=Jack|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAHDywxvxuw|title=DRAW MY LIFE - Jack Douglass|work=jacksfilms|via=[[YouTube]]|date=July 19, 2013|access-date=December 10, 2015}}</ref>

==== ''Your Grammar Sucks'' ====
In June 2011, Douglass began the series ''Your Grammar Sucks'', mocking internet comments with excessive grammatical and spelling errors. This would become a major recurring series on his channel, and grew to include self-created songs and comedic sketches.[[File:Jack Douglass at VidCon 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Douglass at [[VidCon 2014]]]]{{Anchor|Jackask}}

==== ''JackAsk''====
On January 8, 2014, Douglass launched a new series titled ''JackAsk'', in which he answers viewers' questions in a satirical way. The intro and logo for the series are a reference to the TV series of a similar name, ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]''. The last episode of the original ''JackAsk'' was released on October 21, 2020.

On October 21, 2020, Douglass announced on Twitter that he was ending his long-running series JackAsk after 107 episodes after growing tired of the format,<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1319089938537693184|user=jacksfilms|title=I think JackAsk this month is the last JackAsk I'll ever do (just getting tired of the format).

In January 2020, he released the song "[[Twitter for Android]]",<ref>{{Cite web|title=Twitter for Android|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujZcM-DSamA}}</ref> a song made exclusively from tweets that he had put out on [[Twitter]] in the past year. He had started this as a joke because people were criticizing him for using an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphone. The first tweet came out on December 30, 2018, and every day after for a year, he would take a screenshot of the chain of tweets, and add a new tweet each day, often saying "Twitter for Android", but sometimes he would tweet other phrases that would be featured in his song. The last tweet was posted on December 31, 2019, an entire year later. This song has received over 2 million views.

=== ''Yesterday, I Asked You'' (YIAY) ===
On February 3, 2015, Douglass started a daily series on his secondary channel jackisanerd, titled ''Yesterday I Asked You'' (''YIAY''), in which he would ask his viewers a question and then read his favorite answers to the viewers. After 15 days of uploading ''YIAY'' videos to his second channel, jackisanerd, he moved the series to his main channel, jacksfilms, and has released episodes on it since. As of September 2021, he has uploaded 583 episodes, making it the series with the most installments on his channel. He also briefly operated a live version of this series known as ''YIAY LIVE'' (in which he had live viewers on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] compete for the best answer to a given question), which was cancelled due to the large amount of technical difficulties. Many other series, like [[PewDiePie]]'s ''LWIAY'' (''Last Week I Asked You''), [[Davie504]]'s ''SDAIAY'' (''Some Days Ago I Asked You''), Aloona Larionova's ''STTA'' (''Show This To Aloona''), [[Joel Berghult|Roomie]]'s ''SIOR'' (''Slap It On [[Reddit]])'' were inspired by YIAY.

In August 2018, Douglass announced a new series that would take place on [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], called YIAY LIVE.<ref>{{Cite AV media|title=My Big, Fat Announcement|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6MXspLcTxA|last=Douglass|first=John|via=[[YouTube]]|work=jacksfilms}}</ref> This show was a live edition of his popular ongoing series, YIAY, and would have viewers answer his questions in real-time, and he would pick his favorite ones. The viewers would then get to vote for the best answer among those shortlisted ones, and the answer with the most votes would win. There would be 5 different rounds, each with a different format of answering. The winners of the first 4 rounds will be pitted against each other in the final round, and the winner of the final round would receive a code to obtain any merchandise from his official store<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jacksfilms Official Merchandise|url=https://crowdmade.com/collections/jacksfilms|website=Crowdmade|access-date=May 17, 2020}}</ref> for free. This show had seven episodes in total, with the last one coming out in October 2018. A special episode was released on April 1, 2019, and was the only YIAY LIVE episode to be released on YouTube.

In May 2020, Douglass uploaded the 500th episode of YIAY, titled "YIAY #500".<ref>{{cite web |title=YIAY #500 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UThPS_UijHo |access-date=May 28, 2020}}</ref> He previously mentioned that the milestone episode would be 1 hour long,<ref>{{cite tweet |user=jacksfilms |number=931278909101846528 |title=YIAY 500 will be an hour long... |url=https://twitter.com/jacksfilms/status/931278909101846528?lang=en |access-date=May 28, 2020 |date=November 16, 2017}}</ref> similarly to "YGS #100". It also features many of his YouTuber friends. This video, as of May 2021, has accumulated 2.61 million views.
