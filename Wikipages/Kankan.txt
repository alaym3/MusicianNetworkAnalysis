'''Kankan''' ([[Mandingo language|Mandingo]]:&nbsp;Kánkàn; [[N'Ko script|N’ko]]: ߞߊ߲ߞߊ߲߫) is the largest city in [[Guinea]] in [[land area]], and the third largest in population, with a population of 190,722 people as of 2014.<ref name =recensement2014/> The city is located in eastern [[Guinea]] about {{convert|345|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} east of the national capital [[Conakry]].

The city is the capital and largest town of the [[Kankan Prefecture]] and of the [[Kankan Region]]. The population is largely from the [[Mande people|Mande]] ethnic group.

== Geography ==
The city is located on the [[Milo River]], a tributary of the [[Niger River]].

==History==
Kankan was founded by the [[Soninke people]] in the 18th century, after which it became an important trading centre, particularly for [[kola nut]]s, and the capital of the [[Baté Empire]].<ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Kankan Kankan], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 23, 2019</ref>
The population of the city is predominantly from the Mandinka ethnic group and their language is widely spoken throughout the city.

The French explorer [[René Caillié]] spent a month in Kankan in 1827 on his journey from [[Boké]], in present-day Guinea, to [[Djenné]] and [[Timbuktu]] in Mali. He arrived with a [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] transporting [[kola nut]]s. He described the visit in his book ''Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo''. The town had a population of 6,000 inhabitants and was an important commercial centre with a market held three times a week. Instead of having a surrounding mud wall, the town was defended by [[Hedge#Quickset hedge|quickset hedges]]. The chief of the town refused Caillié permission to travel along the river to the north as the town of Kankan was fighting for control of the Bouré gold producing area around [[Siguiri]] and the [[Tinkisso River]]. Instead Caillié left the town heading east in the direction of [[Minignan]] in the Ivory Coast.<ref>{{cite book | last=Caillié | first=René | title=Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo; and across the Great Desert, to Morocco, performed in the years 1824-1828 (Volume 1) | publisher=Colburn & Bentley |location=London | year=1830 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/travelsthroughc00cailgoog/page/n294 254]–286 | url= https://archive.org/details/travelsthroughc00cailgoog }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Quella-Villéger | first=Alain | year=2012 | title=René Caillié, l'Africain : une vie d'explorateur, 1799-1838 | publisher=Aubéron | place=Anglet, France | isbn=978-2-84498-137-0 | language=fr | pages=71–75}}</ref>

The town was conquered by [[Samori Ture|Samory Touré]] in 1881 and occupied by the [[France|French]] in 1891.

In 1904, the city is chosen as the final destination during the construction of the Conakry railway in Kankan.

==Climate==
Kankan has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw'').
