==Early life==
Royce Davison-Rodriguez was born on September 19, 1996, in [[Munster, Indiana]]. Rodriguez would then move to the north side of [[Houston]], Texas, where he'd live for the majority of his life. He played basketball for Gulfport High School basketball team in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/2017/6/ugly-god-basketball-high-school|title=Watch Ugly God Play Basketball in High School|website=HYPEBEAST}}</ref> He was born to an [[Afro-Dominicans|Afro-Dominican]] father and an African-American mother. On his upbringing, Davidson-Rodriguez said, "My mom and dad divorced, so I was raised in the South as a Black person. If you’ve been to [[Dominican Republic]], you should know they have a lot of Spanish, dark Dominicans. They be Black as fuck just like me. My dad happened to be a Black Dominican and my mom’s Black. African-Americans and Latinos have it rough in the U.S.—I’m both, so I guess I’m double rough." Rodriguez grew up speaking both Spanish and English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/01/ugly-god-kap-g-rico-nasty-how-being-latino-impacts-their-music/|title=Ugly God and More Discuss How Being Latino Impacts Their Music – XXL|first=Bianca|last=Torres|website=XXL Mag}}</ref>
