'''Thomas Richard Paxton''' (born October 31, 1937) is an American [[folk music|folk]] singer-songwriter who has had a music career spanning more than fifty years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tom-paxton-mn0000934721/biography|title=Tom Paxton &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2009, Paxton received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref name="TPaxGrammyClip">{{YouTube|Ivh6Y0NrIWA|Tom Paxton Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award Announcement (brief video clip from the 51st Annual Grammy Awards telecast)}}</ref><ref name="WashPostFeb2009">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/06/AR2009020603708.html?referrer=emailarticle Power Of Just Plain Folk, Tom Paxton Humbly Garners Life Grammy], J.

Paxton's songs have been widely recorded, including modern standards such as "[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]", "[[Bottle of Wine]]", "Whose Garden Was This", "The Marvelous Toy", and "Ramblin' Boy".

==Early life==
Paxton was born on October 31, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, United States, to Burt and Esther Paxton. His father was "a chemist, mostly self-educated",<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 12.</ref> and as his health began to fail him, the family moved to [[Wickenburg, Arizona]].  It was here that young Paxton began riding horses at the numerous [[Guest ranch|dude ranches]] in the area.  It was also here that he was first introduced to folk music, discovering the music of [[Burl Ives]] and others.<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 13.</ref>

In 1948, the family moved to [[Bristow, Oklahoma]], which Paxton considers to be his hometown.  Soon after, his father died from a stroke.  Paxton was about fifteen when he received his first stringed instrument, a ukulele.<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 14.</ref> He was given a guitar by his aunt when he was sixteen, and he soon began to immerse himself in the music of Burl Ives and [[Harry Belafonte]].<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 14–15</ref>

In 1955, Paxton enrolled at the [[University of Oklahoma]], where he studied in the drama school.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=939}}</ref> It was here that he first found other enthusiasts of folk music and discovered the music of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[The Weavers]].  Paxton would later note, "Woody was fearless; he'd take on any issue that got him stirred up&nbsp;... and he became one of my greatest influences."<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 17.</ref> In college, he was in a group known as the Travellers, and they sang in an off-campus coffeehouse.<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 18–19</ref>

==Career==
===Early career===
Upon graduating in 1959 with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree, Paxton acted in [[summer stock theatre]] and briefly tried graduate school before joining the [[United States Army|Army]].  While attending the Clerk Typist School in [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]], he began writing songs on his typewriter and spent almost every weekend visiting [[Greenwich Village]] in New York City during the emerging early 1960s [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 20–21.</ref>

Shortly after his [[honorable discharge]] from the Army, Paxton auditioned for the Chad Mitchell Trio via publisher [[Milt Okun]] in 1960.  He initially received the part, but his voice did not blend well enough with those of the group members. However, after singing his song "The Marvelous Toy" for Okun, he became the first writer signed to Milt's music publishing company, Cherry Lane Music Publishing.<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p.22</ref>

Paxton soon began performing at [[The Gaslight Cafe]] in Greenwich Village, where he became a mainstay.<ref name="Larkin"/> In 1962, he recorded a privately produced live album at the Gaslight entitled, ''I'm the Man That Built the Bridges''.<ref name="Larkin"/> During his stay in Greenwich Village, Paxton published some of his songs in the folk magazines ''[[Broadside Magazine|Broadside]]'' and ''[[Sing Out!]]'', and performed alongside such folksingers as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Eric Andersen]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], and [[Mississippi John Hurt]].  Paxton met his future wife, Margaret Ann Cummings (known as "Midge"), at the Gaslight one night in January 1963 after being introduced to her by [[David Blue (musician)|David Blue]].<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p.26</ref>

[[Pete Seeger]] learned a few of Paxton's songs in 1963, including "Ramblin' Boy" (which Seeger performed at [[The Weavers]] reunion concert at [[Carnegie Hall]]) and "What Did You Learn in School Today?" Paxton increased his profile as a performer, appearing at the 1963 [[Newport Folk Festival]], which was recorded by [[Vanguard Records]]. A month after Newport in 1963, Paxton married Midge. He began traveling the country on the coffeehouse and small-venue circuit before returning to New York.<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 26–29.</ref> Paxton became involved with causes that promoted human rights, [[civil rights]] and [[labor rights]]. In 1963, Paxton and a group of other folk musicians performed and offered [[moral support]] to striking [[Coal mining|coal miners]] in [[Hazard, Kentucky]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

After returning to New York in 1964, Paxton signed with [[Elektra Records]], a label which at that time featured a distinguished roster of folk musicians. He would go on to record seven albums for Elektra.  As the folk revival hit its peak, Paxton began getting more work outside of New York City, including benefit concerts and college campus visits. In 1964, he took part in the [[Freedom Summer]] and visited the [[Deep South]], with other folk musicians, to perform at [[voter registration drive]]s and civil rights [[Demonstration (people)|rallies]].  His civil rights song "Beau John" was written after attending a Freedom Song Workshop in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, and the song "Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney" was written about the murders of three civil rights [[Activism|activists]] ([[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], [[Michael Schwerner]], and [[James Chaney]]) in the summer of 1964 by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] near [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. Paxton's own compositions began to be increasingly recognized within folk music circles, and in other genres.

Of the songwriters on the Greenwich Village scene of the 1960s, [[Dave Van Ronk]] said, "Dylan is usually cited as the founder of the new song movement, and he certainly became its most visible standard-bearer, but the person who started the whole thing was Tom Paxton&nbsp;... he tested his songs in the crucible of live performance, he found that his own stuff was getting more attention than when he was singing traditional songs or stuff by other people ... he set himself a training regimen of deliberately writing one song every day.  Dylan had not yet showed up when this was happening, and by the time Bobby came on the set, with at most two or three songs he had written, Tom was already singing at least 50 percent his own material.  That said, it was Bobby's success that really got the ball rolling.  Prior to that, the folk community was very much tied to traditional songs, so much so that songwriters would sometimes palm their own stuff off as traditional."<ref>Dave Van Ronk, ''The Mayor of MacDougal Street'' (2006) p. 197</ref>

In 1965, Paxton made his first tour of the United Kingdom. The tour was the beginning of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included yearly performances there. He met [[Bruce Woodley]], one of the founding members of the Australian folk group [[The Seekers]] and they collaborated on the song "Angeline (Is Always Friday)" which The Seekers recorded and featured in their concerts, TV shows and a DVD. In 1967, the rock group [[Clear Light]] recorded a menacing and lengthy psychedelic version of Paxton's song "Mr. Blue" on their only album ''[[Clear Light (album)|Clear Light]]''.  [[Porter Wagoner]] and [[Dolly Parton]]'s recording of "[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]" reached the top ten on the U.S. country singles charts in December 1967.  Then in 1968, Paxton scored a Top 10 radio hit when [[The Fireballs]] recorded his song "[[Bottle of Wine]]".  In the 1960s, Paxton licensed one of his songs, "My Dog's Bigger than Your Dog", for use in a [[Ken-L Ration]] dog food commercial.  Not too fazed by the success of some of his songs, Paxton continued writing and performing. He was not interested in jumping on the [[folk rock]] (or, as he once joked, "folk rot"<ref>Tom Paxton, "Folk Rot", ''[[Sing Out!]]'' (Autumn 1965)</ref>) bandwagon though, and continued his folk singer-songwriter style on albums like ''Outward Bound'' (1966) and ''Morning Again'' (1968).  On January 20, 1968, three months after the death of Woody Guthrie, Paxton and a number of other prominent folk musicians performed at the [[Harold Leventhal]] produced "A Tribute to Woody Guthrie" concert at New York City's Carnegie Hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.woodyguthrie.org/events/harold.htm|title=Harold Leventhal|website=Woodyguthrie.org|access-date=October 4, 2019}}</ref>

Paxton decided to try some more elaborate recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, as well as his acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate [[Judy Collins]] and his friend [[Phil Ochs]] were experimenting with around this time.  Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts himself with ''The Things I Notice Now'' in the summer of 1969, and also charted with ''Tom Paxton 6'' in the spring of the following year. His song "Whose Garden Was This", an environmentalist anthem written for the first [[Earth Day]], was later recorded by [[John Denver]] and became the title track of [[Whose Garden Was This|Denver's 1970 album]]. Another Paxton song Denver recorded was "Forest Lawn", in whose lyrics Paxton satirized the "theme park approach" to death that [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]] has been accused of having taken.

The diverse "Baroque Folk" experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best.  Regarding this time, he said, "the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most&nbsp;... I ''know'' I didn't have that rock mentality or anything.  I was still a kid from a small town in Oklahoma.  And I just wanted to hear folk songs."<ref name="RUnterberger">{{Cite web|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/paxton.html|title=Tom Paxton Interview|website=Richieunterberger.com|access-date=October 4, 2019}}</ref> Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it was not too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.

===Middle career===
Paxton, his wife and their two daughters lived in [[Holland Park|Holland Park, London]], for about four years in the early 1970s.  After a stay in England due to professional success and love of the country, Paxton and Midge went on a tour of New Zealand and China and even appeared on a Chinese talk show.  Paxton released ''How Come the Sun'' in 1971. The album gave him his highest chart ranking in the U.S. but it only reached number 120 and his next album, ''Peace Will Come'' (1972), barely even reached the charts.  He soon returned to New York City and the [[Long Island]] town of [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] before moving to the Washington, D.C. area around 1977.  After recording three albums for [[Reprise Records]] and a few for "an English label that didn't pan out well",<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 49</ref> Paxton signed with [[Vanguard Records]], with whom he recorded a live album with [[Steve Goodman]], ''New Songs From the Briarpatch'' (1977), which contained some of Paxton's [[topical song]]s of the 1970s, including "Talking Watergate" and "White Bones of Allende" as well as a song dedicated to [[Mississippi John Hurt]] entitled "Did You Hear John Hurt?" In 1978, Paxton released his album ''Heroes'', which contained a song, "Phil", about his friend [[Phil Ochs]], who had taken his own life in 1976.  The album also includes the song "The Death of Stephen Biko", which details the murder of anti-[[History of South Africa in the Apartheid era|apartheid]] activist [[Stephen Biko]] in South Africa. 
Paxton's 1979 album, ''Up and Up'', contains the song "Let the Sunshine", which addresses issues concerning environmentalism and [[solar energy]].  Paxton has also performed at the [[Clearwater Festival]], an annual event, started by [[Pete Seeger]], dedicated to environmentalism and cleaning up the [[Hudson River]].  His 1983 album ''Bulletin'' includes a song about [[Woody Guthrie]] entitled "They Couldn't Take the Music".<ref>[[ArtistDirect]], [http://artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,144530,00.html Tom Paxton: ''Bulletin''.] Retrieved November 14, 2007</ref>

After recording for labels such as Mountain Railroad and Flying Fish in the 1980s, Paxton started his own label, Pax Records, in 1987. It was during this time that Paxton continued to suffer from an undiagnosed and deepening depression that affected his work.  With some advice from Midge, he began to look for a solution and was eventually diagnosed with [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention Deficit Disorder]], for which he received ongoing treatment.<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 50</ref>

===Later career===
In the 1990s, Paxton began delving deeply into [[children's music]], recording nine children's albums during the decade.  In July 1994, Paxton was invited to perform at a folk festival in Israel, "Jacob's Ladder", and he played there and a series of concerts around Israel accompanied by folk guitarist and harmonica player Shay Tochner.  Paxton recorded a live album in 1996 with his good friend Jim Rooney, and it contained some new comical songs about current events.  [[Eric Weissberg]], [[John Gorka]], [[Robin and Linda Williams]], among others, also performed; and the album was titled ''Live: For the Record''.  In the mid-1990s, Paxton also began to give more workshops in songwriting. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2000, Paxton once again began to write more of the [[topical song]]s that had been prominent during his early career.  In 2001, he released an album with Anne Hills entitled ''Under American Skies'', and in 2002, he released an album of all new songs entitled ''Looking for the Moon'' (Appleseed Recordings).  At the time of its release, Paxton was quoted saying that it might be his best album so far.<ref>Behind the Beat audio interview (2002) {{cite web |url=http://www.behindthebeat.net/artist.asp?sid=1&ar=320&al=315 |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 20, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609050609/http://www.behindthebeat.net/artist.asp?sid=1&ar=320&al=315 |archive-date=June 9, 2007 }}</ref>  ''Looking for the Moon'' contains the song "The Bravest", which is about the firefighters who gave their lives while trying to save others in New York City on September 11, 2001. Around this time, Paxton began writing and releasing his "Short Shelf Life Songs" about current events for free download on his website.<ref>[http://www.tompaxton.com/download.html Short Shelf Life Songs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703054937/http://tompaxton.com/download.html |date=July 3, 2007 }}; accessed June 12, 2014.</ref> Paxton wrote a number of [[Topical song|topical]] [[protest song]]s that were critical of the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration's]] actions. In 2007, he rewrote a song of his from 1965 entitled "Lyndon Johnson Told The Nation", about the [[Vietnam War#American ground war|escalation of the war in Vietnam]], and transformed it into "George W. Told The Nation", about the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge in the Iraq war]]. In 2007, Tom Paxton became one of the founding members of the [[Copyright Alliance]], whose purpose is to promote the cultural and economic benefits of copyrights. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2008, Paxton rewrote his song "I'm Changing My Name to Chrysler", about the federal [[History of Chrysler#1980s|loan guarantee to Chrysler in 1979]], as "I Am Changing My Name to Fannie Mae", about the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|700&nbsp;billion dollar "bailout of the U.S. financial system"]]. He continues to perform yearly tours of the United States and UK. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In March 2015, Paxton released the studio album ''[[Redemption Road (album)|Redemption Road]]''.<ref name="Kickstarter Tom Paxton Redemption Road">{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1971199080/tom-paxtons-new-recording-redemption-road |title=Tom Paxton's New Recording-Redemption Road |date= September 28, 2014 |website=[[Kickstarter]] |access-date= March 22, 2015}}</ref> In January 2017, Paxton released ''Boat in the Water'', his sixty-third album.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Tom Paxton Album "Boat In The Water" Out NOW|url=http://www.tompaxton.com/new-tom-paxton-album-boat-in-the-water-out-january-27-2017/|website=tompaxton.com|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>

Paxton is now in "semi-retirement", though he still performs occasional shows and did a 10 venue UK tour in 2017.

Paxton toured the UK in 2018 and 2019 (11 venues), accompanied by [[The Don Juans (band)|The Don Juans]]. His shows featured his 2011 song "What if, no matter" ("He couldn't lay his hands on a gun").<ref name="coventry">{{cite news |last1=Coventry |first1=Joe |title=Tom Paxton and the Don Juans:Capstone Theatre, Liverpool: 13th April 2018 |url=http://www.catalystmedia.org.uk/reviews/tom-paxton-and-the-don-juans/ |access-date=April 15, 2019 |work=Nerve Magazine}}</ref><ref name="whitefield">{{cite news |last1=Whitefield |first1=Mark |title=Tom Paxton: "What if, no matter how angry he was, he couldn't lay hands on a gun?" |url=https://americana-uk.com/tom-paxton-what-if-no-matter-how-angry-he-was-he-couldnt-lay-hands-on-a-gun |access-date=April 15, 2019 |work=Americana UK |date=February 26, 2018}}</ref><ref name="brewery">{{cite web |title=Tom Paxton and the Don Juans |url=https://www.breweryarts.co.uk/event/tom-paxton-don-juans/ |publisher=The Brewery, Kendal |access-date=April 15, 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life and family==
Paxton married his wife, Midge (born Margaret Anne Cummings, February 23, 1945), in 1963. They have two daughters, Jennifer and Kate, and three grandsons. Jennifer is a history professor who has published courses for [[The Teaching Company]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tompaxton.com/jennifer-paxton-and-the-teaching-company/ |title=Jennifer Paxton and The Teaching Company |publisher=Tom Paxton website |author=Tom Paxton |date=March 8, 2010 |access-date=November 4, 2018}}</ref> Midge Paxton died June 1, 2014 after a long illness.<ref name="midge">{{cite news |title=Midge Paxton, 69 |url=https://www.easthamptonstar.com/archive/midge-paxton-69 |access-date=April 5, 2020 |work=The East Hampton Star |date=June 5, 2014}}</ref>

He has described his political views in the following way:  "My own politics more or less resembled [[Will Rogers]]'s politics. He had said that he belonged to no organized political party&nbsp;— he was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]&nbsp;... being young and impassioned almost automatically put me over on the radical side of most issues. Being older, I find myself still more or less there, somewhat to my surprise."<ref>Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000), p. 40</ref>

==Awards, honors, and nominations==
