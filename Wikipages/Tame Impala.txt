==History==

===2007–2008: Early career===
The origins of the act can be found in the Perth music scene. Parker played in a number of bands, one being the Dee Dee Dums, a rock duo that consisted of Parker (guitar) and Luke Epstein (drums). Tame Impala emerged in 2007 as a [[Kevin Parker (musician)|Kevin Parker]] home-recording project in this period and he posted a number of tracks on [[Myspace]]. This brought interest from a number of labels and eventually, he signed a worldwide deal with the independent [[Modular Recordings]] in July 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=5542|title=Tame Impala Sign With Modular|publisher=Undercover.com.au|date=7 July 2008|last=Cashmere|first=Paul|access-date=19 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721031722/http://undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=5542|archive-date=21 July 2008}} {{unreliable source?|date=May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/tame-impala-lonerism-110817 |title=Tame Impala – Lonerism |publisher=The Line Of Best Fit |date=3 October 2012 |access-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220110337/http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/tame-impala-lonerism-110817 |archive-date=20 February 2015  }}</ref> To transfer these recordings to a live-stage, Parker enlisted the help of Dominic Simper (bass) and [[Jay Watson]] (drums) and began playing at some local gigs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songkick.com/artists/927852-tame-impala/gigography?page=33 |title=Tame Impala Tickets, Tour Dates 2015 & Concerts – Songkick |publisher=Songkick.com |access-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006161319/http://www.songkick.com/artists/927852-tame-impala/gigography?page=33 |archive-date=6 October 2014  }}</ref>

Tame Impala's debut album ''[[Innerspeaker]]'' was released on 21 May 2010. In the UK the official release date was 28 June, but [[iTunes]] accidentally{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} made it available for purchase on 12 May. The album was released in the United States on 8 June to general and critical acclaim. [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] named it Best New Music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14279-innerspeaker/ |title=Tame Impala: Innerspeaker &#124; Album Reviews |work=Pitchfork |date=28 May 2010 |access-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716011649/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14279-innerspeaker/ |archive-date=16 July 2015  }}</ref>

In an interview with [[Triple J]] talking about the album's nomination for the [[J Award]], Parker stated that they had secretly been recording a new album. "Jay and I have been recording pretty compulsively and album number two is nearing potential completion already and I'm so excited about it that I'm having trouble keeping myself from telling you all about it". This came only months after ''Innerspeaker'' was released.

The group toured in mid-2010, commencing the ''Innerspeaker'' album tour on 13 May 2010 as the opening act for [[MGMT]]'s 2010 American tour.  The band returned to Australia to play at [[Splendour in the Grass]] festival, which was followed by a European Tour in July (including an appearance at the [[Reading Festival]]) and a national Australian tour in October. In November they returned to the UK and Europe for a fifteen date tour, including their largest London headline show to date which was attended by [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Tom Meighan]], [[Sergio Pizzorno]], [[Noel Fielding]], [[Alexa Chung]] and [[Alison Mosshart]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/daily-gossip/53627 |title=NME News Kasabian's Tom Meighan offloads stagewear to Oxfam – Daily Gossip |work=NME |date=29 October 2010 |access-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720232631/http://www.nme.com/news/daily-gossip/53627 |archive-date=20 July 2015  }}</ref> the band then went on to the United States and Canada for twenty headline dates including sold-out shows in Toronto, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. They also received four 2010 [[ARIA Music Awards]] nominations which include, "Album of the Year" and "Best Rock Album" for ''Innerspeaker'', "Best Group" and also "Breakthrough Artist".<ref>[http://www.take40.com/news/20335/2010-aria-nominations-announced---full-list-here!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002004145/http://www.take40.com/news/20335/2010-aria-nominations-announced---full-list-here!|date=2 October 2010}}</ref>

===2011–2014: ''Lonerism''===

[[File:Tame Impala @ Sir Stewart Bovell Park (3 1 2011) (5359140996).jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Parker performing with Tame Impala in March 2011]]
Tame Impala's second album, ''[[Lonerism]]'' was released in 2012 and was mixed by [[Dave Fridmann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davefridmann.com/dave/News.html|title=Dave Fridmann|publisher=Dave Fridmann|date=7 December 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116193421/http://www.davefridmann.com/dave/News.html|archive-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> Parker said that ''Lonerism'' "represents a departure from his previous work by incorporating an expanded sonic palette, more emotional song writing, and a more pronounced narrative perspective". It was created in a similar set up as ''Innerspeaker'', whereby Parker wrote and recorded the majority of the album by himself at his home in Perth, Western Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/new-tame-impala-album-due-mid-2012/ |title=New Tame Impala Album Due Mid 2012 |publisher=musicfeeds.com.au |access-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222124322/http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/new-tame-impala-album-due-mid-2012/ |archive-date=22 February 2012  }}</ref> Parts of the recording also occurred in Parker's home studio in France.

While in France, Parker produced and played on the self-titled [[dream pop]] album by [[Melody's Echo Chamber]], the project of French singer [[Melody Prochet]]. As a result, one of the tracks on ''Lonerism'' is titled "Endors Toi", which roughly translates from [[French language|French]] to English as "fall asleep". The album cover is a photo taken by Parker of the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]] in Paris, France, with additional editing by [[Leif Podhajsky]], a graphic designer who created the album art for ''Innerspeaker''. The image ties into the themes of isolation of ''Lonerism'', with a metal gate separating the viewer from the people in the Gardens.<ref name="Lonerism Album Cover">{{cite web|title=Lonerism Album Cover|url=http://leifpodhajsky.com/|publisher=Leif Podhajksy|access-date=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719164519/http://leifpodhajsky.com/|archive-date=19 July 2012}}</ref>

It is believed that Parker started recording the follow-up album to ''Lonerism'' at the beginning of 2014, due to various Instagram posts that showed recording taking place at the Wave House in [[Western Australia]], where the debut album ''Innerspeaker'' was recorded.<ref name="Third album recording snippet">{{cite web |url=http://instagram.com/p/kgVxS-KXah/?modal=true |title=Instagram |publisher=Instagram |date=17 February 2014 |access-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821044951/https://instagram.com/p/kgVxS-KXah/?modal=true |archive-date=21 August 2015  }}</ref> Prior to this, Parker had been touring with Tame Impala and working on other musical projects, including his disco-funk band, AAA Aardvark Getdown Services. Parker said in May 2013:

<blockquote>
Right now, doing another album doesn't excite me. There's something narrow-minded about thinking an album is the only way you can put out music, especially in the world we’re in at the moment. Anything is possible. There's so many people doing interesting things with the internet and technology, there could be so many ways of making music and listening to it. It's 2013 and you can make music anywhere ... There are so many possibilities, my brain is overloading on them all. I just need to wait, think about things a bit more.

In May 2014, Parker spoke of his growing inclination toward the recording of another album in a triple J radio interview, explaining that: "I'm getting more and more sucked into the world of making an album.

In October 2021, the band announced a deluxe box set edition of ''The Slow Rush'' would be released in February 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/tame-impala-announce-the-slow-rush-deluxe-edition-share-new-video-watch/|title= Tame Impala Announce The Slow Rush Deluxe Edition, Share New Video: Watch|website=pitchfork.com|date=6 October 2021|access-date=9 October 2021}}</ref>

==Musical style==
[[File:Tame Impala-3760 (18222291464).jpg|thumb|Tame Impala performing in 2014]]
Parker's decision to make the music for Tame Impala in the studio by himself is a result of Parker liking "the kind of music that is the result of one person constructing an awesome symphony of sound. You can layer your own voice 700 times for half a second if you want, and I just love that kind of music".<ref name="Nylon TV Interview">{{cite web|title=Nylon TV Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4m_BKefOQg|publisher=Nylon TV|access-date=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626043715/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4m_BKefOQg|archive-date=26 June 2014}}</ref> However, Parker has to translate his music to a live setting with the band, and the band doesn't play the songs until they have been recorded. "The only [[jam session|jamming]] that's done as a band is done a long time after the song is recorded for the sake of the live environment. It's good for us, because we can take a song that's been recorded and do what we want to it: slow it down, speed it up, make it 10 seconds or 10 minutes long. It gives us a lot of freedom."<ref name="Tame Impala - Inner Visions" />

Some favoured and often-used effects by Parker include [[Phaser (effect)|phasing]], [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[Reverberation|reverb]] and [[Distortion (music)|fuzz]]. Experimentation with different effects pedals such as Roland RE-20 Space Echo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equipboard.com/pros/kevin-parker|title=Kevin Parker Equipboard|website=Equipboard|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref> has led to Parker creating new and unique sounds. "If you make an effort to not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used." "People have a [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] pedal and then a [[reverberation|reverb]] pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded. You can do different things just by treating things differently."<ref name="Undercover TV interview">{{cite web|title=Undercover TV interview|url=http://www.uctv.com.au/site/play/391-Tame-Impala-Undercover-Interviews|publisher=Undercover TV|access-date=14 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121231011401/http://www.uctv.com.au/site/play/391-Tame-Impala-Undercover-Interviews|archive-date=31 December 2012}}</ref>

Parker's process for making music is "I’ll have a sudden, spontaneous vision of a song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and do my best to record it as quick as I can. I’ll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I’ll have a whole bunch of them [demos] and then I’ll just choose which ones to make into full songs".<ref name="Tame Impala - Inner Visions" /> Parker has a strong sense of [[melody]] in his music, having composed "excessively melodic music from about the age of 12 to 15".<ref name="LA Times interview">{{cite web|title=LA Times interview|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221201723/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|archive-date=21 December 2011}}</ref> For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story."<ref name="Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview" /> Parker also said "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me."<ref name="Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview" />

===Influences===
[[File:Tame Impala @ La Riviera, Madrid (9280795653).jpg|thumb|Tame Impala's music and live visuals are heavily influenced by psychedelic music.]]
Parker's music is heavily influenced by late 1960s and early 1970s [[psychedelic rock]],<ref>{{cite web |author=K. Ross Hoffman |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/innerspeaker-mw0001990920 |title=Innerspeaker – Tame Impala &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=3 July 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621111734/http://www.allmusic.com/album/innerspeaker-mw0001990920 |archive-date=21 June 2014  }}</ref> which is achieved through various production methods. Parker said that he has a "fetish for extremely sugary pop music" from artists like [[Britney Spears]] and [[Kylie Minogue]].<ref name="Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview|url=http://www.wowmagazine.fr/2010/06/tame-impala-interview-3/|publisher=WOW Magazine|access-date=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806165632/http://www.wowmagazine.fr/2010/06/tame-impala-interview-3/|archive-date=6 August 2013}}</ref> Parker also loves "fucked-up explosive cosmic music" in the vein of [[The Flaming Lips]],<ref name="In the Studio feature">{{cite web|title=In the Studio feature|url=http://tameimpala.com/news/in-the-studio-feature/1319.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331204449/http://www.tameimpala.com/news/in-the-studio-feature/1319.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 March 2012|publisher=tameimpala.com|access-date=13 July 2012}}</ref> with whom Parker collaborated on the track "Children of the Moon" in 2012, for the release ''[[The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends]]''.<ref name="The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends">{{cite web |url=http://flaminglips.com/shop/item/1417/the-flaming-lips-and-heady-fwends-%28rsd-release%29/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423193622/http://flaminglips.com/shop/item/1417/the-flaming-lips-and-heady-fwends-(rsd-release) |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 April 2012 |title=The Flaming Lips Official Store – Music, CDs, T-Shirts, Merchandise |publisher=Flaminglips.com |access-date=17 July 2015  }}</ref>

Combining these two things, [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] have influenced Parker's music with their contrasting combination of loud guitars and ethereal melodies. Parker has "always been in love with the [[wall of sound]] as employed by My Bloody Valentine" and he tries to capture that "melancholy dreamy feel".<ref name="Kevin Parker LA Times Interview">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala's Kevin Parker Discusses His Band's Success, Origins and Impressions of California|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221201723/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/innerspeaking-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-discusses-his-bands-success-origins-and-impressions-of-calif.html|archive-date=21 December 2011}}</ref> Parker tries to incorporate this balance into his own music. "If I was singing, I wouldn't be able to match the tone of the instruments, which is really crunchy. The instruments are quite sonically brutal, but the voice is really soft, and I think that kind of resonates with people. It's kind of like My Bloody Valentine, where it's really brutal sounding, but kind of beautiful at the same time".<ref name="Tame Impala Sopitas interview">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala en entrevista para Sopitas.com|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uZjIsSVngY|via=YouTube|access-date=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017181404/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uZjIsSVngY|archive-date=17 October 2013}}</ref> Tame Impala live drummer Jay Watson has described Parker's music as containing "[[shoegaze]]y guitar sound, but not played in a shoegazey manner".<ref name="Tame Impala Hartzine interview">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala Hartzine interview|url=http://vimeo.com/18386586|via=Vimeo|access-date=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928091551/http://vimeo.com/18386586|archive-date=28 September 2013}}</ref>

[[Electronic dance music|Electronic music]] is another influence. Parker has used rock instrumentation in an electronic manner, saying "The way we do music, it's organic, but it's meant to be quite repetitive and hypnotic, almost in a kind of electronic nature. Using our playing as though it was a living sample".<ref name="Tame Impala KCRW interview">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala KCRW interview|url=http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2010/12/tame-impala-live-on-kcrw/|publisher=KCRW|access-date=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721173821/http://blogs.kcrw.com/musicnews/2010/12/tame-impala-live-on-kcrw/|archive-date=21 July 2012}}</ref> A heavy feature on ''[[Innerspeaker]]'' is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a [[synthesizer|synth]]. Parker mentioned this by saying "I had a few obsessions when recording ''Innerspeaker''. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples and pretty much anything except guitars and drums. I'm obsessed with confusing people as to the origin of a sound."<ref name="Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview" /> He has described his dream collaboration as "probably [being] someone really, really kind of fucked up", citing the electronic artists [[Aphex Twin]] and [[Squarepusher]] as examples: "You know, someone that would like scare me, but I'd be able to see how they do all their really insanely headcase stuff and I'd be able to learn from it."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tame Impala|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/7822-tame-impala/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref>

Parker was inspired to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, "I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and I used to get the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, even if it was just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar."<ref name="Tame Impala WOW Magazine Interview" />

[[Lo-fi]] music is also a favourite of Parker's, and he incorporated it heavily in the early days of Tame Impala, heard prominently on the ''[[Tame Impala EP]]''. With the release of ''Innerspeaker'', Parker went for a different approach to a lo-fi sound, aiming more for a more cosmic and sonic [[wall of sound]], helped by mixer [[Dave Fridmann]]. Parker explained "It sounds more cohesive, like an organism. It has a different emotion to it, it brings out a different feeling when it's absolutely blaring at you. I love that sound."<ref name="Tame Impala - Inner Visions">{{cite web|title=Tame Impala – Inner Visions|url=http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|publisher=Mess and Noise|access-date=14 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630160656/http://www.messandnoise.com/articles/3964065|archive-date=30 June 2012}}</ref>

Parker has also stated that [[Supertramp]], one of his favourite bands, are a major influence on the musical style of Tame Impala. Despite their difference in sound, he feels he is always somewhat "channeling Supertramp".<ref name="TheVine-interview-2014">{{cite web |url=http://www.thevine.com.au/music/interviews/tame-impala-i-have-no-idea-how-successful-we-are-20140116-271521 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201190822/http://www.thevine.com.au/music/interviews/tame-impala-i-have-no-idea-how-successful-we-are-20140116-271521 |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2014 |title=Tame Impala: "I have no idea how successful [we] are"|publisher=TheVine |author=Doug Wallen |date=16 January 2014 |access-date=20 January 2014}}</ref> He has said that listening to the [[Bee Gees]] on mushrooms inspired him to change the sound of the music he was making on ''Currents''.<ref>{{cite web|title = Tame Impala's Kevin Parker reveals listening to the Bee Gees while on drugs inspired his new album|url = https://www.nme.com/news/tame-impala/86681|website = NME|access-date = 17 November 2015|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151214095039/http://www.nme.com/news/tame-impala/86681|archive-date = 14 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>
