== Biography ==

=== Beginnings (2005–2010) ===
Alix and Mattia met in middle school. The former is from [[Île-de-France]], and the latter is from [[Milan]]. The inspiration for the group's name comes from this period. "Odezenne was the name of our old principal. We used it in a freestyle and it made us laugh, so we kept it," explains Alix.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.cafebabel.fr/culture/article/odezenne-des-mecs-qui-chantent-en-francais.html|title= Odezenne : " Des mecs qui chantent en français "|date= 20 April 2016|work= Café Babel|access-date= 26 May 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170922144823/http://www.cafebabel.fr/culture/article/odezenne-des-mecs-qui-chantent-en-francais.html|archive-date= 22 September 2017|url-status= dead}}.</ref> In 2005, the group was initially called O2zen (which has a phonetic similarity in French to Odezenne).<ref name="ovni">{{Cite web |url= http://www.mowno.com/disques/odezenne-ovni/ |title= Odezenne – " Ovni " |author=François Renoncourt |date=4 April 2011 |work=Mowno |access-date=26 May 2016}}.</ref> The two friends later met Jacques, from [[Choisy-le-Roi]], who at the time went by Jaco H17.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.tsugi.fr/magazines/2015/12/15/entretien-odezenne-gout-epoque-13163 |title= Entretien : Odezenne, le goût de l'époque |date= 15 Dec 2015 |work= tsugi |access-date= 26 May 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304011123/http://www.tsugi.fr/magazines/2015/12/15/entretien-odezenne-gout-epoque-13163 |archive-date= 4 March 2016 |url-status= dead }}.</ref>

The group started recording their first songs between 2005 and 2007. A friend offered them their first gig at Inca, an underground bar known throughout the city of [[Bordeaux]] as being the place where many local groups first played. Odezenne filled the room and returned to the bar three more times in April 2007. They decided to record an album, put on concerts, and start their label, Universeul, since they wanted to be independent. Released in November 2008, their first studio album, titled ''Sans chantilly'', was well received by critics.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.chroniquemusicale.com/?p=18221 |title= Souvenir – Odezenne |date= 7 May 2013 |work= chroniquemusicale |access-date= 26 May 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610153652/http://www.chroniquemusicale.com/?p=18221 |archive-date= 10 June 2016 |url-status= dead }}.</ref>

=== ''O.V.N.I.'' (2011–2013) ===
In March 2011, after eleven months in the studio, the group released their second album, a [[concept album]]<ref name="ovni" /> by the name of ''O.V.N.I. _Orchestre Virtuose National et Incompétent'', the acronym of which also doubles as the acronym for UFO in French. This time, the album was sold in some stores. With their growing popularity, Odezenne released a deluxe version of the album in 2012 with five new songs, calling it "''L'édition Louis XIV''" (the Louis XIV Edition).

Since the end of 2011, the group has released a series of music videos, exclusively produced by Universeul, which have strongly helped launch the group. The first was for the song "Gomez" and was directed by Selim Bentounes, followed by "Taxi," directed by Adrien Benoliel. It was the video for "Tu pu du cu" that was the group's first big hit on the web. The young director Romain Winkler became more and more active with the group and directed the videos for "Saxophone," "Chewing-gum," "Rien" (Nothing), "Je veux te baiser" (I Want to Fuck You), and "Vilaine."

In late 2012 the group was named on the FAIR 2013, a list of musicians chosen by a French music publication, which helped solidify Odezenne's presence in the French music scene. Their reputation afforded them a spot in many of the largest music festival in the summer of 2014, notably [[Vieilles Charrues Festival|Les Vieilles Charrues]], the [[Eurockéennes]] of [[Belfort]], the Paléo Festival in [[Switzerland]], the [[Solidays]], [[Les Francofolies de La Rochelle|Francofolies]] of [[La Rochelle]], and Fusion Festival in [[Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.leparisien.fr/massy-91300/massy-le-groupe-odezenne-au-centre-culturel-paul-b-17-02-2016-5554021.php#xtref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.fr |title= Massy : le groupe Odezenne au centre culturel Paul B. |date=17 Feb 2016 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |access-date=26 May 2016}}.</ref> In October 2013, the group released a live EP recorded at Vivres de l'art in [[Bordeaux]] to celebrate their hundredth concert.

=== ''Rien'' (2014) ===
On 21 April 2014, the group released "Rien"'' ''(Nothing), which was later released as a part of an [[Extended play|EP]] of the same name in May 2014. The EP was mainly known thanks to the music video for "Je veux te baiser" (I want to fuck you). The video was an instant hit due to the subject matter and quickly went viral on social media.

===''Dolziger Str. 2'' (2015–present)===

Following a winter trip in Berlin that lasted several months, Odezenne released ''Dolziger Str. 2'' on 13 November 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.indiepoprock.fr/chroniques/albums/odezenne/dolziger-str-2/ |title= Odezenne - ''Dolziger Str. 2'' |work=Indiepoprock |access-date= 26 May 2016}}.</ref> The first single, "Bouche à lèvres," was released as a music video which was widely spread on social networks despite its –18 warning.

== Role of the Internet ==
Odezenne is a group whose career is intimately linked to the [[DIY ethic]] and to the power of the Internet. Starting in 2008, barely twelve days after its release, the album artwork for ''Sans chantilly'' was displayed prominently on the home page of the music platform [[Deezer]] and the 1,000 copies quickly sold without being available in stores. Odezenne achieved this feat while opting neither to sign with a label nor try to get their songs on the radio, relying instead on word of mouth on social networks.
