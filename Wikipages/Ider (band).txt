'''Ider''' (Stylized in all-capital letters) are an English singer-songwriter duo from London, United Kingdom, composed of two friends Megan Markwick and Lily Somerville. Their music style combines features of various [[musical genre]]s, and it has been described as "post-genre" or "cross-genre".<ref name="lineofbestfit">{{cite web |url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/ider-soul-sisters |title=IDER: Soul Sisters |last=Williams |first=Pip |date=17 July 2019 |website=The Line of Best Fit |publisher= |access-date=4 January 2020 |quote=}}</ref> Formed in 2016 after its members met at [[Falmouth University]], Ider has released a number of singles, and released their debut EP, ''[[Gut Me Like an Animal]]'', in 2017. Their first full-length album, ''[[Emotional Education]]'', was released two years later in 2019.

==Background==
Ider's members, Lily Somerville, who is originally from [[Tamworth, Staffordshire]], and Megan Markwick, who is from [[North London]], met during the first term of their Bachelor of Arts course in Popular Music at [[Falmouth University]] in 2012. The pair were put into a group with other music students, but quickly began working as a duo. Throughout university, they formed a friendship and began songwriting together; they also performed together during this time as an [[acoustic folk]] duo called "Lily & Meg".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/falmouthuni/posts/147906755371702|title=Falmouth University|website=Facebook.com|access-date=2020-06-23}}</ref> As Lily & Meg, they released some singles, including "I'll Be Yours", and two EPs.<ref name="musicglue">{{cite web |url=https://www.musicglue.com/lily-and-meg/about |title=About – LILY & MEG |date= |website=musicglue.com |publisher= |access-date=4 January 2020 |quote=}}</ref> They eventually moved to London, where they now share a flat. It was after they graduated from Falmouth in 2016 that they released their first single as Ider, ''Sorry''. In 2017, they were signed to [[Glassnote Records]].<ref name="glassnote">{{cite web |url=https://www.musicweek.com/labels/read/glassnote-records-adds-ider-to-uk-roster/068120 |title=Glassnote Records adds Ider to UK roster |last=Gumble |first=Daniel |date=11 April 2017 |website=Musicweek.com |publisher= |access-date=5 January 2020 |quote=}}</ref>

Having previously joked that "Ider" is an [[alter ego]] which "manifests itself when [they] harmonise", Somerville and Markwick have stated that the band's name is an invented name that they decided to call themselves.<ref name="independent">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/ider-interview-emotional-education-debut-album-release-date-a9011001.html |title=IDER: The duo giving voice to mid-20s melancholy – ‘We’re so intertwined, we understand each other’s language’ |last=White |first=Adam |date=22 July 2019 |website=The Independent |publisher= |access-date=4 January 2020 |quote=}}</ref>
