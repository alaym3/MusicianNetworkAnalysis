'''Makbule Hande Özyener''' (born 12 January 1973), better known by her stage name '''Hande Yener''', is a Turkish singer. She made her debut in the early 2000s, and since then has become a prominent figure of [[Turkish pop music]] with numerous songs that rose to the top of music charts. Alongside her music career, she is also known for her choice of clothes and has renewed her image multiple times over the years. She has occasionally made changes in her music style as well; for a while, she started making electronic music, but this period was short-lived and she again returned to performing pop music. During her career, both her professional and personal life have been among the favorite subjects of columnists, and her rivalry and on and off feud with [[Demet Akalın]] were covered in the tabloids from time to time.

Yener was born in [[Kadıköy]], [[Istanbul]]. After finishing her middle school she decided to go to a conservatory, but after facing objections from her family, she enrolled in [[Erenköy Girls High School]]. She left the school while in the second grade and got married. To achieve her dream of becoming a singer, she tried to get in contact with [[Sezen Aksu]], and while she was working as a shop assistant she met [[Hülya Avşar]] who later introduced her to Aksu. She worked as Aksu's backing vocalist for a while, before working with Altan Çetin who helped her with preparing her first studio album, ''[[Senden İbaret]]'', which was released in 2000. She later released the [[MÜ-YAP]] certificated album ''[[Sen Yoluna... Ben Yoluma...]]'' (2002), followed by ''[[Aşk Kadın Ruhundan Anlamıyor]]'' (2004) and ''[[Apayrı]]'' (2006). These albums made her one of the successful artists inside Turkey in the 2000s. With the album ''[[Nasıl Delirdim?]]'' (2007), she shifted her style to electronic music and distanced herself from pop music for a while. During this period, which formed the first decade of her career, many of her songs became great hits, including "Yalanın Batsın", "Sen Yoluna... Ben Yoluma...", "Acele Etme", "Kırmızı", "Kelepçe", "Aşkın Ateşi", "Kibir" and "Romeo".

Although [[Hande Yener#2007–09: Nasıl Delirdim?, Hipnoz and Hayrola?|Yener's electronic songs]] received critical praise, she suffered commercial loss compared to her previous works, which resulted in several problems with her producing partners, causing a change in the production company and label twice. Hence, Yener's era of electronic music ended in a few years and with the pop album ''[[Hande'ye Neler Oluyor?]]'' (2010) she returned to pop music charts. The pop albums released in this phase of her career were often compared to her initial albums, and although they received mixed reviews in general, many of their songs, especially the ones from ''[[Mükemmel]]'' (2014) and ''[[Hepsi Hit Vol. 1|Hepsi Hit]]'' (2016–17) managed to top the music charts in Turkey. Among these songs were "Bodrum", "Ya Ya Ya Ya", "Naber", "Sebastian", "Mor", "Bakıcaz Artık" and "Beni Sev".

Throughout her career, Yener has been influenced by a number of artists, including [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] to whom her image, clips and performances were often compared. In the 2000s, she was one of the few artists who had an album that successfully sold over 1 million copies in Turkey. In 2013, she was the Turkish singer whose music videos were viewed the most on YouTube. By the end of the 2000s, she was known as a gay icon inside Turkey, and made some statements demanding the advancement of [[LGBT rights in Turkey]], but she became the target of criticism after being silent about LGBT issues in the following years. In the second half of the 2010s, she expanded the scope of her work and worked periodically as the operator of various night clubs. Yener has received five Golden Butterfly Awards, as well as four [[Turkey Music Awards|Kral Turkey Music Awards]] and has received various other awards and nominations.

During this period, she began to meet music mentor Erdem Siyavuşgil, who said that she had the potential of becoming a soloist. Yener later began to take singing lessons and made numerous efforts to get in contact with [[Sezen Aksu]]. Subsequently, she began working as a sales representative at the Mudo store in Suadiye, knowing that many artists would pass by the store, and that way she could "reach Aksu through the celebrities" who would shop in the store. She later found Aksu's phone number, and left her notes everyday, asking her for a chance to become her backing vocalist, but did not receive any response. Many singers who came to the store, including [[Nilüfer (singer)|Nilüfer]], [[Şehrazat]] and [[Sertab Erener]], left her wish for contacting Aksu unanswered. Yener started to lose her hope of becoming a singer, until she met [[Hülya Avşar]], who promised her that she would make an appointment for her with Aksu. In April 1993, Yener met Aksu through Avşar's help, and performed the songs "Yalnızlık Senfonisi" and "Oyun Bitti" for Aksu during the meeting. After winning Aksu's favor, she began working for her and for two years served as her backing vocalist and assistant.<ref name="itiraf"/><ref name="titredim"/> In December 1994, she made her television debut as a vocalist in [[Cem Özer]]'s program ''Laf Lafı Açıyor''.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Laf Lafı Açıyor|people=Presnter: [[Cem Özer]]; Guests: [[Levent Yüksel]], [[Sezen Aksu]] and [[Sertab Erener]]|location=Mecidiyeköy, Istanbul|date=28 October 1994}}</ref> To work in bars, she stopped working for Aksu and for a number of years performed at various places in Turkey.

=== 2004–06: ''Aşk Kadın Ruhundan Anlamıyor'' and ''Apayrı'' ===
[[File:Hande Yener - Müzik Dergisi - 2004 (cropped).png|thumb|200px|Yener during an interview with ''Müzik Dergisi'' in December 2004]]
Yener's third studio album was recorded in [[Hamburg]] and Istanbul, and was released under the title ''[[Aşk Kadın Ruhundan Anlamıyor]]'' in July 2004 by Erol Köse Production. Yener later said that she had become more professional while working on this album and "I listen to the songs while being played by guitar with all my soul and feelings, as a listener. If I like it myself, I'll give it a thumbs-up. I mean, questions like 'Does it become a hit, how much will it sell?' do not pop up in my head. I don't put myself in the mindset that we are preparing this album for Hande Yener. The team also worked with the same energy, very intensely, everyone put their most precious and valuable songs together for this album. All the songs they made were very successful and they were songs that could be considered classic in terms of quality. They just gave me the songs that matched with my style."<ref name=akra>{{cite news |url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2004/07/25/cumartesi/acum.html|title=14 yıl barda söyledim artık başka planlarım var|newspaper=Milliyet|first=Yiğit|last=Karaahmet|date=25 July 2004|access-date=16 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050201015200/http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2004/07/25/cumartesi/acum.html|archive-date=1 February 2005}}</ref><ref name=uc>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelshow.com/2072/roportaj/hande-yener-ucte-uc-yapti.html|title=HANDE YENER, Üçte Üç Yaptı|publisher=Michael Show|first=Michael|last=Kuyucu|date=22 October 2004|access-date=21 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321170230/http://www.michaelshow.com/2072/roportaj/hande-yener-ucte-uc-yapti.html|archive-date=21 March 2015}}</ref> The album was well-received and found successful by music critics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yazarlar/uluc/2004/08/25/iki_album|title=İki albüm!..|newspaper=Sabah|first=Can|last=Sayın|date=25 August 2004|access-date=17 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714124219/http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yazarlar/uluc/2004/08/25/iki_album|archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> The hit songs "Acele Etme", "Kırmızı" and "Acı Veriyor" were all turned into music videos, followed by separate clips for "Armağan", "Hoşgeldiniz" and "Bu Yüzden".<ref name=kralpop>{{cite web|url=http://www.kralpoptv.com.tr/sanatcilar/detay/hande-yener|title=Hande Yener|publisher=Kral Pop|access-date=6 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714163557/http://www.kralpoptv.com.tr/sanatcilar/detay/hande-yener|archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> "Acele Etme", "Kırmızı" and "Acı Veriyor" became number-one hits on many radio's music lists.<ref>"Acele Etme", "Kırmızı" and "Acı Veriyor" on music charts:

In 2007, Yener got in argument with various other singers after she used the term "grocery music" and her name started to appear in court cases and lawsuits. Due to these arguments, her feud with [[Demet Akalın]] started and their fight became among the hot topic of tabloids for years. After being compared to Akalın in an interview, Yener made a response which eventually started the feud and said: "I do Western music, so I can not compete with those who make [[Fantezi|fantasy music]]. What Demet does is not similar to my style." Akalın continued the argument by saying: "If she does not like me, why is she after my works?

=== Influences ===
[[File:Madonna - Rebel Heart Tour - Antwerp 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|American singer Madonna has been a source of inspiration for Yener.]]
Yener has said that she has been influenced by various artists while shaping her career. Before becoming famous, she was mostly inspired by Sezen Aksu about which she said: "I was always imitating Sezen Aksu, and especially I would keep singing her songs 'Sen Ağlama' and 'Hadi Bakalım'. Meeting her and working alongside her to enter the music industry had made me freak out."<ref name=titredim/> While describing the songs in her first studio album, she said: "Because I'm a fan of [[Jennifer Lopez]], there are fast and intense songs in my album that wriggle people's souls."<ref name=ibaret/>

The songs in her album ''Sen Yoluna... Ben Yoluma...'' were found similar to those of Aksu's early career, and with the release of ''Aşk Kadın Ruhundan Anlamıyor'' she was described by many as "[[Ajda Pekkan]] of the future" as her music style in this album was compared to that of Aksu, as well as Pekkan.<ref name=sybymichael/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2002/08/18/sanat/san22.html|title=Duyduk duymadık demeyin!|newspaper=Milliyet|first=Naim|last=Dilmener|date=18 August 2002|access-date=6 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021228170332/http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2002/08/18/sanat/san22.html|archive-date=28 December 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelshow.com/album-yorumlari/hande-yener-ask-kadin-ruhundan-anlamiyor-erol-kose-2004|title=HANDE YENER – Aşk Kadın Ruhundan Anlamıyor (Erol Köse – 2004)|publisher=Michael Show|first=Michael|last=Kuyucu|access-date=27 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125206/http://www.michaelshow.com/album-yorumlari/hande-yener-ask-kadin-ruhundan-anlamiyor-erol-kose-2004|archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> In response to comparisons, Yener said that she has been influenced by both of them and said: "I listened to foreign music for years.

[[File:Hande Yener (7).jpg|thumb|right|Yener was referred to as a gay icon in Turkey for a while, but she became target of criticism in the following years after being silent about LGBT issues and working with people who were against homosexuals.]]
In the late 2000s, Hande Yener was referred to as Turkey's gay icon, but the sincerity of her relationship with the [[LGBT]] movement in the late 2010s was questioned. After the release of ''Nasıl Delirdim?'' in 2007, Yener was asked questions about the fondness of gay people of herself. Yener responded by saying: "I think they are very good music listeners.

Yener's relationship with the LGBT movement and the questioning of this relationship came up again in 2018. In the second half of the year, she released her first English song "Love Always Wins". The name of the song is the same as the Love Wins slogan used in 2015 for the recognition of homosexual marriage in the US, and it brought back the questions surrounding Yener's relationship with the movement back to the surface, and at the same time led to criticism as she had remained silent on LGBT issues for ten years.<ref name="t24.2808"/> Following the songwriter Mert Ekren's comments, in which he stated that he hated homosexuals, Yener's decision to continue working with Ekren gave rise to a number of reactions. Onur Baştürk from ''Hürriyet'' saw the choice for the song's title as an effort to promote Yener outside Turkey through the LGBT movement and criticized the singer by saying, "When it suits your work, 'love wins'. ...

In the same period, Yener became the target of criticism from the LGBT movement after images and footage showing the singer İntizar being involved in an intimate relationship with another woman were leaked on the internet. Poll Production, which served as the production company for both İntizar and Yener, immediately terminated its contract with İntizar after the leak of the images and videos. Yener supported the production company's decision for dismissing İntizar, and as a result both the production company owner Polat Yağcı and Yener were labeled as [[homophobic]] and became subject of criticism. The company and Yener reacted to the criticism by issuing separate statements and arguing that the contract's termination was not related in any way to İntizar's sexual orientation, and the decision was only made because of the lack of trust between the two parties.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.posta.com.tr/intizarin-yapim-sirketi-poll-productiondan-ikinci-aciklama-2025119|title=İntizar'ın yapım şirketi Poll Production'dan ikinci açıklama!|newspaper=Posta|date=14 July 2018|access-date=26 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714152817/https://www.posta.com.tr/intizarin-yapim-sirketi-poll-productiondan-ikinci-aciklama-2025119|archive-date=14 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://gzone.com.tr/sozde-gey-ikonundan-homofobi-gundemiyle-alakali-aciklama/|title=Sözde "gey ikonu"ndan homofobi gündemiyle alakalı açıklama(!)|magazine=Gzone|date=14 July 2018|access-date=26 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526131844/http://gzone.com.tr/sozde-gey-ikonundan-homofobi-gundemiyle-alakali-aciklama/|archive-date=26 May 2019}}</ref> In May 2019, a party which included a show making fun of Demet Akalın and Yener's feud and in which a number of [[drag queen]]s had participated was cancelled due to the unauthorized use of Yener's name at the event.
