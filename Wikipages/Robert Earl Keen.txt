'''Robert Earl Keen''' (born January 11, 1956)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.folklib.net/index/birth/birth_k.shtml#Keen,RE |author=Henkle, Doug |title=FolkLib Index |access-date=January 16, 2018 }}</ref> is an American singer-songwriter and entertainer. Debuting with 1984's ''No Kinda Dancer'', the Houston native has recorded 18 full-length albums for both independent and major record labels.  His songs have had [[cover version]]s recorded by many musicians, including [[George Strait]], [[Joe Ely]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] and [[Nanci Griffith]].

Although both his albums and his live performances span many different styles, from folk, country, and bluegrass to rock, he is most commonly affiliated with roots music. Keen has toured extensively both in the US and abroad throughout his career, and was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 along with Lyle Lovett and the late [[Townes Van Zandt]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Davis|first=John T.|title=Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame will induct Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen and Townes Van Zandt|newspaper=Austin American Statesman|access-date=January 4, 2012|url=http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/music/texas-heritage-songwriters-hall-of-fame-will-ind-2/nRkpq}}</ref>
