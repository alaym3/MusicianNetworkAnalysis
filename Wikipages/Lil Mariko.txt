==Early life==
Katherine Mariko Zhang was born to a Chinese father and a Japanese mother in 1997. Her family lived in [[Taipei]] for a while before permanently moving to [[Houston, Texas]] where she would spend most of her childhood.

==Career==
===2019‚Äì2021: Initial success and ''Lil Mariko''===
The collaborative single "Where's My Juul??" was freestyled by Lil Mariko as a joke in August 2019 using a beat made by Full Tac. The track benefited from Zhang's heavy metal past and love of 1990's [[rave music]]. Guitarist Russ Chell provides the metal riff on the track. Despite being made as a joke, Zhang took serious influence from [[Mindless Self Indulgence]] and [[The Prodigy]]. The music video for the track was released on December 18. Lil Mariko's vocals were also likened to [[Poppy (musician)|Poppy]].<ref name="Paper mag">{{Cite web| url=https://www.papermag.com/wheres-my-juul-full-tac-2642227365.html| title='Where's My Juul??'

The trend was comparatively similar to the clown check trend where users would do the same but to [[Insane Clown Posse]] songs instead.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://stayhipp.com/news/wheres-my-juul-trend-on-tiktok/| title="Where's My Juul?"
