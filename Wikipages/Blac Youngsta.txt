== Early life ==
Sammie Marquez Benson was born on April 8, 1990, in McMillan Street, a poor area on the southside of [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Benson and his younger brothers were raised by their grandparents. Despite both of his grandparents having jobs, they earned very little and struggled to put food on the table. Benson's grandfather managed to get him a job at a local grocery store when he was just 7 years old, however, he was fired when the manager caught him placing fake orders to the store in order to take the food home for him and his brothers. After losing his job at the store, Benson began selling drugs and served numerous sentences in prison for drug and gun charges. In 2012, after serving a year in prison, Benson began hosting local block parties which made him locally popular in [[South Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee|South Memphis]]. Shortly after, he began pursuing a career in music, releasing his debut mixtape ''Fast Bricks'' in 2012.<ref name="hotnewhiphop.com" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2016/03/interview-blac-youngsta-growing-up-poverty-jail-guns-memphis|title=Blac Youngsta Has A Serious Story To Share|date=March 29, 2016|website=Vibe|access-date=March 28, 2019}}</ref>
