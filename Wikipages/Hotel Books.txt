'''Hotel Books''' is an American [[spoken-word]] project from [[Porterville, California]] revolving around the poetry of Cam Smith (born February 16, 1993). The project is often presented on tour as a full band, but has also been shown as a solo project of Cam Smith. They are known for Smith's unique vocal style, which is often the central focus of their work.

== History ==
Hotel Books began in 2010. After the release of "Call Me Human," many demos were released online, which ultimately became "Everything We Could Have Done Differently." After extensive touring in the US and overseas, the band signed to [[InVogue Records]], under which they released a double-packaged EP, "I'm Almost Happy Here, But I Never Feel At Home" as well as two full band records, "Run Wild, Young Beauty," and "Run Wild, Stay Alive," along with two albums in the "Equivalency" series and an experimental LP "I'll Leave the Light on Just in Case."

The band's InVogue Records debut, "I'm Almost Happy Here, But I Never Feel at Home" was released July 1, 2014, via InVogue Records. The album received mostly positive reviews, as well as earned the band their first Billboard chartings; No. 9 on Alternative New Artists and No. 20 on Heatseekers, for the album's debut week.<ref>{{cite web|title=Billboard Heatseekers Chart 7/1/2014|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2014-07-05/heatseekers-albums|website=Billboard Charts}}</ref> Their next effort, "Run Wild, Young Beauty," was released on April 7, 2015, and spent three total weeks on the Billboard charts.

In 2016, Hotel Books released their second long-player "Run Wild, Stay Alive" to negative and mixed reviews. The album focused more on the rock elements and traditional song structure.

In October of 2017, Hotel Books released "Equivalency" via InVogue Records to critical acclaim.

Hotel Books has toured the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia, playing with a variety of notable acts, including [[Defeater (band)|Defeater]], [[Counterparts (band)|Counterparts]], and [[I Prevail]].<ref>{{cite web|title=IndieVisionMusic Interviews Hotel Books|url=http://www.indievisionmusic.com/2013/08/26/hotel-books/|website=Indie Vision Music|date=August 26, 2013|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}</ref>
