'''Crazy Town''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''CXT''') is an American [[rap rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles, California]], in 1995 by [[Epic Mazur|Bret Mazur]] and [[Shifty Shellshock|Seth Binzer]]. Crazy Town is best known for their 2000 hit single, "[[Butterfly (Crazy Town song)|Butterfly]]", which reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and helped their debut album, ''[[The Gift of Game]]'' (1999) sell over 1.5 million units. Their follow-up album, ''[[Darkhorse]]'' (2002) failed to achieve the same level of success, contributing to the band's break-up in 2003. Mazur and Binzer reformed the band in 2007, and released their third album, ''[[The Brimstone Sluggers]]'', in  2015. In 2017, Mazur left the band and Binzer changed the name of the band to '''Crazy Town X'''.

==History==
===Formation (1995–1999)===
[[Epic Mazur|Bret Mazur]] and [[Shifty Shellshock|Seth Binzer]], who go by the names of Epic and Shifty Shellshock, respectively, started collaborating under the name of "The Brimstone Sluggers" in 1995 in Los Angeles, along with [[Adam Bravin]] (a.k.a. DJ Adam 12) who preceded DJ AM. However, they did not become serious about releasing any material until much later.<ref name="2001 interview">{{cite magazine |last1=Edwards |first1=Gavin |title=Q&A: Shifty Shellshock of Crazy Town |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date= March 15, 2001 |issue=  864 |page=35 }}</ref> By early 1999, [[Rust Epique]], James Bradley Jr (a.k.a. JBJ)., Doug Miller, [[Adam Goldstein]] (a.k.a. DJ AM), and Antonio Lorenzo "Trouble" Valli joined the band. Prior to joining the band, Bradley was the drummer for jazz trumpeter [[Chuck Mangione]] from 1977 to 1981, and had been a member of the alternative rock band [[Mary's Danish]] in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Keeps |first1=David |title=U are now Entering Crazy Town |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/u-are-now-entering-crazy-town-46206/ |date=August 2, 2001 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |archive-date=March 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190317120704/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/u-are-now-entering-crazy-town-46206/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Crazy Town's debut album, ''[[The Gift of Game]]'', was released in November 1999, having been recorded earlier that year.

===''The Gift of Game'' and "Butterfly" (1999–2001)===
The release of ''The Gift of Game'' was followed by a tour support slot for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Guitarist Rust Epique left the band while the album was being mixed, and Crazy Town was joined by Kraig Tyler shortly after. The first two singles from ''The Gift of Game'', "Toxic" and "Darkside", were released but failed to chart.<ref name="where ya been">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1551815/where-ya-been-city-high-crazy-town.jhtml |title=Where Ya Been?: City High Drop Out, Crazy Town Stop The Insanity |last1=Kaufman |first1=Gil |date=February 8, 2007 |work=[[MTV]] |archive-date=April 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428020752/http://www.mtv.com/news/1551815/where-ya-been-city-high-drop-out-crazy-town-stop-the-insanity/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2000, Crazy Town was signed to tour with [[Ozzfest]]; however, they were forced to withdraw after only two weeks when Binzer was arrested after he threw a chair through a window while he was drunk.<ref name="2001 interview"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427579/crazy-town-leaves-ozzfest-after-arrest.jhtml |title=Crazy Town Leaves Ozzfest After Arrest |last1=Johnson |first1=Tina  |date=July 13, 2000 |work=[[MTV]] |archive-date=April 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401162902/http://www.mtv.com/news/1427579/crazy-town-leaves-ozzfest-after-arrest/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Crazy Town then released their third single in 2001, "Butterfly" (which uses samples from Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Pretty Little Ditty"). It reached number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. [[Soundscan]] reports 100,000 album sales of ''The Gift of Game'' prior to the release of "Butterfly"; after "Butterfly" reached number 1, sales exceeded 1.5 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/77197/billboard-bits-crazy-town-nelly-ny-metropolis-fest |title=News on Crazy Town, Nelly, NY Metropolis Fest |last=Jeckell |first=Barry |date=January 10, 2002 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |archive-date=November 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126050648/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/77197/billboard-bits-crazy-town-nelly-ny-metropolis-fest |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:CrazytownGERMANY.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Crazy Town performing live in Germany in 2000]]
Crazy Town toured with Ozzfest in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1458830/crazy-town-hope-to-put-an-end-to-butterfly-boys-taunts/ |title=Crazy Town Hope To Put An End To 'Butterfly Boys' Taunts |last1=D'Angelo |first1=Joe |date=November 22, 2002 |work=[[MTV]] |archive-date=October 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010011530/http://www.mtv.com/news/1458830/crazy-town-hope-to-put-an-end-to-butterfly-boys-taunts/ |url-status=live}}</ref> They were received with mixed reviews; many people in the Ozzfest crowd mockingly called them "The Butterfly Boys".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1439313/crazy-town-join-ozzfest/ |title=Crazy Town Join Ozzfest |last1=D'Angelo |first1=Joe |date=February 12, 2001 |work=[[MTV]] |archive-date=August 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822015450/http://www.mtv.com/news/1439313/crazy-town-join-ozzfest/ |url-status=live}}</ref> A fourth single, "[[Revolving Door (song)|Revolving Door]]", was released with limited success. In 2001 Crazy Town also made a cameo appearance in the music video for "[[Bad Boy for Life]]" by [[P. Diddy]], [[Black Rob]] and Mark Curry.

===''Darkhorse'' (2001–2003)===
Their second album, ''[[Darkhorse]]'', was produced by [[Howard Benson]] and released on November 12, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457740/crazy-town-ride-darkhorse.jhtml |title=Crazy Town Take On All Comers With Darkhorse |last1=Wiederhorn |first1=Joe |date=September 23, 2002 |work=[[MTV]] |archive-date=February 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210212213231/http://www.mtv.com/news/1457740/crazy-town-take-on-all-comers-with-darkhorse/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Benson's influence resulted in a more [[Rock music|rock]] oriented sound. Prior to recording the album, drummer James Bradley Jr. eventually left the band and was replaced by Kyle Hollinger. The album achieved little commercial success, spawning only two singles: "[[Drowning (Crazy Town song)|Drowning]]", which became a minor hit in the US, UK, Austria and Germany, and "Hurt You So Bad", which failed to chart at all.  Shortly after the release of ''Darkhorse'' the band broke up in 2003, citing amongst other things, pressure from their record company for a "Butterfly" follow-up.<ref name="where ya been"/>

===Hiatus (2003–2007)===
During Crazy Town's hiatus, Bret Mazur went on to form ''The Pharmacy'', a record-producing company. Shortly after leaving Crazy Town, [[Rust Epique]] formed a band which would eventually go by the name [[pre)Thing]]. He died of a [[heart attack]] shortly before their debut album ''[[22nd Century Lifestyle]]'' was released in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ex-crazy-town-guitarist-dead-20040310/ |title=Ex-Crazy Town Guitarist Dead |last=Swanson |first=David|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 10, 2004 |archive-date=May 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529114936/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ex-crazy-town-guitarist-dead-92139/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Binzer contributed vocals to [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s 2002 single ''Starry Eyed Surprise''. He released his first solo album in 2004, ''[[Happy Love Sick]]'', under his alias [[Shifty Shellshock]]. Kraig Tyler joined Eric Powell's industrial band ''[[16Volt]]''.

===Reformation (2007–2011)===
In late 2007, Crazy Town announced that the remaining members had reformed and were working on a new studio album, tentatively titled ''Crazy Town is Back'', which would be released sometime in 2008,<ref name=reformed>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Chris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1575877/kris-kross-crazy-town-emf-extreme-and-more-unmemorable-reunions-in-our-year-end-top-10s/|title=Kris Kross, Crazy Town, EMF, Extreme And More Unmemorable Reunions, In Our Year-End Top 10s - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |work=[[MTV]] |date=December 5, 2007 |archive-date=June 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607204212/http://www.mtv.com/news/1575877/kris-kross-crazy-town-emf-extreme-and-more-unmemorable-reunions-in-our-year-end-top-10s/ |url-status=live}}</ref> though no such release was ever made.

===Mazur's departure, line-up change and ''Crazy Town X'' (2017–present)===
In January 2017, after a year of hiatus from the band, Epic announced through his [[Facebook]] post that he will no longer tour with the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/officialcrazytown/posts/638407856362788|title=To all of our fans and friends...|last=Mazur |first=Bret |date=January 10, 2017 |work=Crazy Town (via [[Facebook]]) |access-date=January 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/bret.mazur.12/posts/10202578548661312?match=Y3JhenkgdG93bixjcmF6eSx0b3du|title=Statement from Epic...|last=Mazur |first=Bret |date=January 10, 2017 |work=Bret Mazur (via [[Facebook]]) |access-date=January 11, 2017}}</ref> Epic intends to still be involved with Crazy Town, though not as a band member. Following Mazur's departure, Rick Dixon, Nick Diiorio and Kevin Kapler also left the band in early April.  Shifty decided to add an "[[X mark|X]]" next to the band's name. When asked about the letter's significance on their [[Instagram]] account, the band stated "the X is used by gangs to symbolize a territory that has just been won".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkJ0wkpHw9X/ |title=Instagram post |last=Binzer |first=Seth |date=June 18, 2018 |work=Instagram |url-status=live}}</ref>
