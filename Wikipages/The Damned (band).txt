As one of the first gothic rock bands, the Damned were a major influence on the [[goth subculture]] with lead singer Vanian's vampire-themed costume, baritone singing voice and dark lyrics being major influences.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |date=1 November 2000 |title=Alternative Rock |publisher=Miller Freeman Books |isbn=0-87930-607-6}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and Stiff years (1976–1978)===
Dave Vanian (David Lett), Captain Sensible (Raymond Burns) and Rat Scabies (Chris Millar) had been members of the band [[Masters of the Backside]], which also included future [[The Pretenders|Pretenders]] frontwoman [[Chrissie Hynde]].<ref name="The Damned">{{cite web|url=http://www.octopusmediaink.com/TheDamned.html |title=The Damned |publisher=Octopusmediaink.com |access-date=21 February 2012}}</ref> [[Brian James (guitarist)|Brian James]] (Brian Robertson) had been a member of [[London SS]], who never played live, but in addition to James included musicians who later found fame in [[The Clash]] and [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]]. Scabies knew James through a failed audition as drummer for London SS.<ref>{{cite book|author=Colegrave, Stephen and Chris Sullivan|title=Punk: The Definitive Record of a Revolution|publisher=[[Perseus Books Group|Thunder's Mouth Press]]|page=103|year=2001|isbn=9781560257691|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_t1hA7Zq0IC&q=tony+james+brian+james+mick+jones+london+ss&pg=PA105}}</ref> When the two decided to start their own band, with James on guitar and Scabies on drums, they invited [[Sid Vicious]] and Dave Vanian to audition to be the singer. Only Vanian showed up, and got the part.<ref name="The Damned"/> Sensible became the band's bassist, and the four called themselves The Damned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nypress.com/qa-with-the-damneds-captain-sensible|author=Tabb, George|title=Q&A with the Damned's Captain Sensible|publisher=NYPress.com|date=16 September 2001|access-date=4 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809153328/http://nypress.com/qa-with-the-damneds-captain-sensible/|archive-date=9 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Chrissie Hynde would later write that "Without me, they were probably the most musically accomplished punk outfit in town".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hynde|first1=Chrissie|title=Reckless|date=2015|publisher=Ebury Press|isbn=9781785031441}}</ref>

The Damned played their first show on 6 July 1976, supporting the [[Sex Pistols]] at the [[100 Club]]. A [[fidelity|lo-fi]] recording of the show was later released as ''[[Live at the 100 Club (The Damned album)|Live at the 100 Club]]''.<ref name="recordcollectormag.com">{{cite web|url=http://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/damned-damned-damned-expanded-edition|title=The Damned- Damned Damned Damned Expanded Edition|publisher=Record Collector Mag.com|access-date=4 July 2015}}</ref> As part of London's burgeoning punk scene, The Damned again played the club on 20 September, for the [[100 Club Punk Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/the-100-club-punk-rock-festival/|title=The 100 Club Punk Rock Festival|publisher=Rock's Back Pages.com|access-date=4 July 2015}}</ref>

On 22 October, five weeks before the release of the Sex Pistols' "[[Anarchy in the U.K.]]", [[Stiff Records]] put out The Damned's first single, "[[New Rose]]", thus making them the first UK punk band to release a single. The single's [[B-side]] was a fast paced cover of The Beatles' "[[Help! (song)|Help!]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/the-damned-damned-damned-damned-review |title=The Damned - Damned Damned Damned |magazine=Uncut |date=14 December 2012 |access-date=15 July 2015}}</ref> "New Rose" was described by critic Ned Raggett as a "deathless anthem of nuclear-strength romantic [[angst]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=Song Review by Ned Raggett |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/new-rose-mt0027067015 |title=New Rose - The Damned &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |website=AllMusic |access-date=17 April 2014}}</ref>

When the Sex Pistols released their single, they took The Damned, along with The Clash and [[Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers]], as openers for their December "Anarchy Tour of the UK". Many of the tour dates were cancelled by organizers or local authorities, with only seven of approximately twenty scheduled shows taking place. The Damned were kicked off the tour before it ended by Sex Pistols manager [[Malcolm McLaren]].<ref>Robb, John, ''Punk Diary'', pp. 263–273; Savage, Jon, ''England's Dreaming'', pp. 267–275.</ref>

The Damned released their first album, ''[[Damned Damned Damned]]'', on 18 February 1977. Produced by [[Nick Lowe]], it was the first full-length album released by a British punk band, and included a new single, "[[Neat Neat Neat]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=Ned Raggett |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/damned-damned-damned-mw0000193727 |title=Damned Damned Damned - The Damned &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=16 April 1977 |access-date=15 July 2015}}</ref> The band went on tour to promote the album, in March opening for [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] on their final tour. Later that spring, they became the first British punk band to tour the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/28/entertainment/ca-33475 |title=Still Damned - latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=12 May 2002 |access-date=15 July 2015}}</ref> According to [[Brendan Mullen]], founder of the Los Angeles club [[The Masque]], their first tour of the U.S. found them favouring very fast tempos, helping to inspire the first wave of west coast [[hardcore punk]].<ref>see Mullen's comments in the [[Don Letts]] directed documentary ''Punk: Attitude''.</ref>

That August, [[Lu Edmonds]] was added as a second guitarist.<ref name="recordcollectormag.com"/> This expanded line-up unsuccessfully tried to recruit the reclusive [[Syd Barrett]] to produce their second album.<ref>{{cite news|author=Nick Kent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/12/popandrock.sydbarrett3 |title=Nick Kent on life and death of Syd Barrett, the most famous recluse in rock &#124; Music |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=15 July 2015}}</ref> Unable to get Barrett, they settled for his former [[Pink Floyd]] bandmate, [[Nick Mason]]. In December, this album was released as ''[[Music for Pleasure (The Damned album)|Music For Pleasure]]'', and was quickly dismissed by critics. Its failure led to the band being dropped from Stiff Records.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Woodstra |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-pleasure-mw0000200275 |title=Music for Pleasure - The Damned &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=15 July 2015}}</ref> Scabies was also displeased with the album, and quit the band after the recording. He was replaced by future [[Culture Club]] drummer [[Jon Moss]], who played with The Damned until they decided to break up in February 1978.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gray, Marcus|title=The Clash: Return of the Last Gang in Town|publisher=4th Estate|year=1995|isbn=9780634082405|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=29hwkUOFO9QC&q=rat+scabies+jon+moss&pg=PA264}}</ref>

===Reformation and ''Machine Gun Etiquette'' (1978–1979)===
The former members of the band worked on a series of brief side projects and solo recordings, all making little commercial impact. Scabies formed a one-off band called "Les Punks" for a late 1978 gig: Les Punks was a quasi-reunion of The Damned (without Brian James or Lu) that featured Scabies, Vanian, Sensible and bassist [[Lemmy]] of [[Hawkwind]] and [[Motörhead]]. The Damned tentatively reformed with the "Les Punks" line-up in early 1979, but originally performed as "The Doomed" to avoid potential trademark problems. Captain Sensible switched to guitar and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s, and after a brief period with Lemmy on bass for studio demos and a handful of live appearances,<ref>see the notes for ''Smash It Up - The Anthology 1976–1987''</ref> and a slightly longer period with [[Henry Badowski]] on bass, the bassist position was filled by [[Algy Ward]], formerly of [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]]. During a December 1978 tour of Scotland, [[Gary Holton]] filled in for Vanian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/gary-holton-actor-and-heavy-metal-kid-a-look-back-at-a-cult-figure/ |title=Gary Holton (RIP) A look back at a cult figure |website=Louderthanwar.com |date=22 April 2012 |access-date=26 July 2014}}</ref>

The band officially went by The Damned again, playing their first gig under that name in April 1979, and signing a deal with [[Chiswick Records]]. They went back to the studio and released the charting singles, "[[Love Song (The Damned song)|Love Song]]" and "[[Smash It Up]]", followed by 1979's ''[[Machine Gun Etiquette]]'', and then a cover of [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]".<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17625/damned/|title=DAMNED &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref> Vanian's vocals had by now expanded from the high-[[baritone]] of the early records to a smoother [[crooning]] style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kemptown.co.uk/freerad/captain/sensible.htm |title=Sensible - Crooner Vanian |website=Kemptown.co.uk |access-date=21 February 2012}}</ref>

''Machine Gun Etiquette'' featured a strong 1960s [[garage rock]] influence, with [[Farfisa]] organ in several songs. Recording at Wessex Studios at the same time as [[The Clash]] were there to record ''[[London Calling]]'', [[Joe Strummer]] and [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] made an uncredited vocal appearance on the title track. Fans and critics were pleasantly surprised, and ''Machine Gun Etiquette'' received largely positive reviews; [[Ira Robbins]] and Jay Pattyn described it as "a great record by a band many had already counted out".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=damned |title=TrouserPress - Damned |publisher=TrouserPress.com |access-date=21 February 2012}}</ref>

=== Shift towards gothic rock (1980–1987) ===
Ward left the group in 1980, to be replaced by [[Paul Gray (English musician)|Paul Gray]], formerly of [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]]. ''[[The Black Album (The Damned album)|The Black Album]]'' was released later that year, produced by the band themselves apart from one track produced by [[Hans Zimmer]], with three sides of the [[double album]] consisting of studio tracks, including the theatrical 17-minute song "Curtain Call". Side 4 featured a selection of live tracks recorded at Shepperton. It was their last album for Chiswick.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In 1981, The Damned released ''[[Friday 13th (EP)|Friday 13th]]'', a four song E.P. on which featured original tracks "Disco Man", "Billy Bad Breaks", "Limit Club", and a cover of [[The Rolling Stones]] song "[[Citadel (The Rolling Stones song)|Citadel]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/damned.htm#friday|title=The Damned|website=Markprindle.com|access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref>

In 1982, The Damned released their only album for [[Bronze Records]], ''[[Strawberries (album)|Strawberries]]''.  The band had now expanded to a quintet, with the addition of new full-time keyboardist [[Roman Jugg]]. At this time, Sensible was splitting his time between The Damned and his own solo career, which had seen success in the UK with the number one hit "[[Happy Talk (song)|Happy Talk]]" in 1982. Consequently, the group's next album was a one-off side project recorded without the unavailable Sensible: a soundtrack to an imaginary 1960s movie called ''Give Daddy the Knife, Cindy''.<ref>[http://crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com/Article.aspx?id=5824 "Naz Nomad and the Nightmares"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220025047/http://crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com/Article.aspx?id=5824 |date=20 December 2008 }}, ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'', 27 February 2008.</ref> This limited-run album of 1960s [[Cover version|cover songs]] had the band billed as [[Naz Nomad and the Nightmares]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In 1984, The Damned made a live performance on the [[BBC Television]] show ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' performing their song "Nasty", featuring new bassist [[Bryn Merrick]] (replacing Gray) and both Jugg and Sensible on guitar.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Sensible played a last concert with the band at [[Brockwell Park]], before leaving to pursue his solo career.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3PODgAAQBAJ&q=the+damned+brockwell+park+1984&pg=PA1996|title=Smashing It Up: A Decade of Chaos with The Damned|first=Kieron|last=Tyler|date=12 June 2017|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9781783238903|via=Google Books}}</ref>

[[File:DavidVanianatExeter.jpg|thumb|right|Vanian in 2013]]
From the beginnings of the band, Vanian had adopted a [[vampire]]-like appearance onstage, with chalk-white makeup and formal dress.<ref>"Vanian's smart crooning and spooky theatricality ended up more or less founding goth rock inadvertently (with nearly all his clones forgetting what he always kept around -- an open sense of humour)." [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4021|pure_url=yes}} allmusic (((The Damned > Biography)))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> With Sensible gone, Vanian's image became more characteristic of the band as a whole. The Damned signed a contract with major label [[MCA Records|MCA]], and the ''[[Phantasmagoria (The Damned album)|Phantasmagoria]]'' album followed in July 1985, preceded by the UK No.&nbsp;21 single "[[Grimly Fiendish]]". Other hits from the same album were "[[The Shadow of Love]]" with its gloomy gothic sound, and the lighter "[[Is It A Dream?]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In January 1986, the non-album single "[[Eloise (Paul Ryan song)|Eloise]]", a cover of a 1968 hit by [[Barry Ryan (singer)|Barry Ryan]], was a No.&nbsp;3 chart success in the UK, the group's highest chart placing to date.<ref name="auto1"/>

However, ''Phantasmagoria'''s November 1986 follow-up, ''[[Anything (The Damned album)|Anything]]'', was a commercial failure, although MCA did include one of its tracks ("[[In Dulce Decorum]]") on the soundtrack release of ''[[Miami Vice]] II''. The cover of [[Love (band)|Love]]'s "[[Alone Again Or]]" was also released as a single.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Late in 1987 The Damned began to work on a new album for MCA, but the result of these sessions remain unreleased as the record contract was dissolved. Two of the new songs ("Gunning for Love" and "The Loveless and The Damned") were later re-recorded by the [[Dave Vanian and the Phantom Chords]] side project.

=== Final Damnation Tour (1988-89) === 
James and Sensible rejoined the group temporarily for a few live appearances including a concert at the London Town and Country Club in June 1988 which was released the following year as ''[[Final Damnation]] – The Damned Reunion Concert''. Following a farewell concert at London's Brixton Academy supported by The Milk Monitors, Horse, and [[Claytown Troupe]], the band disbanded again.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Second and third reformations (1990–1995)===
Although officially on hiatus, the group issued two singles in 1990. The first, "Fun Factory", was a song recorded in 1982 by the Sensible/Vanian/Scabies/Gray line-up; intended for single release at the time, the bankruptcy of their record company prevented the issue of the record for 9 years. The year's second single, "Prokofiev", was recorded by Scabies, Vanian and Brian James, and was sold on a 1991 reunion tour of the US.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In 1993 the group reformed again with a new line-up featuring Scabies, Vanian, guitarists Kris Dollimore (formerly of [[The Godfathers]]), Alan Lee Shaw, and bassist [[Moose Harris]] (formerly of [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]]). Around this time, two prominent modern rock groups each covered a Damned song: [[Guns N' Roses]] recorded "New Rose" for their ''[["The Spaghetti Incident?"]]'' (1993), while [[The Offspring]] covered "[[Smash It Up]]" for the ''[[Batman Forever]]'' [[soundtrack]] (1995). Both cover versions enjoyed major label distribution and created more exposure to the Damned sound, sometimes to a younger audience unfamiliar with the group.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The reformed Damned toured regularly for about two years and released a new full-length album, ''[[Not of This Earth (The Damned album)|Not of This Earth]]'' in late 1995. Promoted with a series of long tours prior to its release, by the time the album was released The Damned had yet again split, partly as the result of legal battles: Vanian and Sensible accused Scabies of releasing ''Not of This Earth'' without proper authorization.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Return of Captain Sensible and new lineup (1996–2003)===
Sensible rejoined Vanian in 1996 and yet another formation of The Damned appeared. This initially featured bassist [[Paul Gray (English musician)|Paul Gray]], who was later replaced by [[Patricia Morrison]], previously of [[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]], [[The Gun Club]] and [[The Sisters of Mercy]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

By February 1999, The Damned consisted of Vanian, Sensible, Morrison and new recruits [[Monty Oxymoron]] on keyboards and Spike T. Smith on drums. Spike would later that year go on to join [[List of Morrissey personnel|Morrissey]]'s live band and on Spike's recommendation the band recruited Andy (Pinch) Pinching, a founding member of [[English Dogs]], to replace him on drums. Garrie Dreadful, another recruit from Sensible's solo band, played drums from 1997 to 1999 then gave way to Spike. In 2001, the band released the album [[Grave Disorder]], on [[Dexter Holland]]'s Nitro Records label and promoted it with continual touring. A spring tour of the United States was planned in 2002 supporting [[Rob Zombie]]. However, the band dropped off after a few shows with Captain Sensible saying, "gothic punk was completely lost on the predominantly [[Heavy metal music|metal]] crowds". In the summer they played the [[Vans Warped Tour]] in the US.<ref name="punknews">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/3035/the-damned-drop-off-rob-zombie-tour|title=The Damned drop off Rob Zombie Tour &#124; Punknews.org|publisher=punknews.org|access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref>
