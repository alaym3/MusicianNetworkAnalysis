'''William Dale Fries Jr.''' (born November 15, 1926)<ref name="LarkinCountry">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=247}}</ref> is an American singer, activist and politician best known by his [[stage name]] '''C. W. McCall''', and for his truck-themed [[outlaw country]] songs.

==Biography==
As a child, C. W. McCall enjoyed listening to [[country music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oldies.com/artist-view/CW-McCall.html|title=C.W. McCall|website=Oldies.com}}</ref>

In 1973, while working as a creative director for Bozell & Jacobs, an [[Omaha, Nebraska]], advertising agency, Fries created a [[Clio Award]]-winning (1974) television advertising campaign advertising Old Home Bread for the Metz Baking Company. The advertisements featured a truck driver named C. W. McCall,<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> who was played by [[Dallas]], Texas, actor, Jim Finlayson. The waitress named Mavis Davis was played by Dallas actress, Jean McBride Capps. The commercial's success led to songs such as "Old Home Filler-Up an' Keep on a-Truckin' Café", "[[Wolf Creek Pass (album)|Wolf Creek Pass]]" and "[[Black Bear Road]]".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> Fries wrote the [[lyrics]] and sang while [[Chip Davis]], later of [[Mannheim Steamroller]], wrote the music.

McCall is best known for the 1976 No. 1 hit song, "[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]", which came at the peak of the [[CB radio|CB]] fad in the United States.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> It sold over two million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in December 1975.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/361 361] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/361 }}</ref> Though McCall is not a [[one-hit wonder]], "Convoy" has since become his [[signature song]]. McCall first charted the song "Wolf Creek Pass", which reached No. 40 on the U.S. pop top 40 in 1975. At least three other songs reached the [[Billboard Hot 100]], including "Old Home Filler-Up an' Keep on a-Truckin' Cafe", "[['Round the World with the Rubber Duck]]" (a [[pirates in popular culture|pirate]]-flavored sequel to "Convoy"), as well as the environmentally-oriented "There Won't Be No Country Music (There Won't Be No Rock 'n' Roll)".<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> A dozen McCall songs appeared in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart, including the sentimental "[[Roses for Mama (song)|Roses for Mama]]" (1977).<ref name="LarkinCountry"/>

In 1978, the movie ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' was released, based on the C. W. McCall song.<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> The film starred [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Ali MacGraw]], [[Burt Young]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]] and was directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]].<ref name="LarkinCountry"/> It featured a new version of the song, written specially for the film.

In addition to the "original six" McCall albums released between 1975 and 1979, two rare singles exist. "Kidnap America" was a politically/socially-conscious track released in 1980 during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], while "Pine Tar Wars" referred to [[Pine Tar Game|an event that actually happened]] in a [[New York Yankees]]-[[Kansas City Royals]] baseball game during 1983 (a dispute concerning the application of a large quantity of pine tar to a baseball bat used by [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]], one of the Royals' players).

In 1986, McCall was elected mayor of the town of [[Ouray, Colorado]], ultimately serving for six years.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RM&p_theme=rm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB4D999410879D3&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM "'McCall' Leaves Office"], ''Rocky Mountain News'', January 14, 1992. Accessed March 25, 2008</ref>

In 1990, [[American Gramaphone|American Gramaphone Records]] issued a CD containing a number of old McCall tracks re-recorded for the digital CD age, plus a new song, "Comin' Back For More", which was inspired by [[Alferd Packer]], an alleged 19th century [[cannibal]].

In 2009, McCall was inducted into the [[Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]].

The song "Convoy" is featured in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''. In 2014, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked "Convoy" No. 98 on their list of 100 Greatest Country Songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/100-greatest-country-songs-of-all-time-20140601/98-c-w-mccall-convoy-1975-0211083 |title=98.
