'''Vicki Ann Lawrence''' (née '''Axelrad''';<ref>{{cite web |title=California Birth Index, 1905-1995 |website=ancestry.com}}</ref> born March 26, 1949),<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=1439}}</ref> sometimes credited as '''Vicki Lawrence Schultz''', is an American [[actress]], [[comedian]], and pop music [[singing|singer]] known for the many characters she originated on [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', where she appeared from 1967 to 1978, for the entire series run.  One such character was "[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]" matriarch [[Thelma Harper|Thelma Harper/Mama]], the cold, unaffectionate mother of the neurotic, misfortunate [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) although Lawrence is 16 years younger than Burnett. Thelma Harper was the central character of the television situation comedy series  ''[[Mama's Family]]'' on [[NBC]] and, later, in first-run syndication. She also starred in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom series ''[[The Cool Kids (TV series)|The Cool Kids]]''.

In 1973, she became a [[one-hit wonder]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. chart]] with "[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]". It reached number one on both the United States and Canada charts. Lawrence has multiple [[Emmy Award]] nominations, winning one in 1976.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1976/outstanding-continuing-or-single-performance-by-a-supporting-actress-in-variety-or-music|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}</ref>

She is also a multiple [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominee, all for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. Lawrence has made numerous post-''Mama's Family'' guest TV show appearances in her famed Thelma Harper/Mama role.

On February 5, 2013, Lawrence appeared as the character in a special sketch for ''[[Betty White]]'s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/movies-specials-more/video/categories/betty-whites-second-annual-90th-birthday-party|title=Video Gallery|publisher=NBC|access-date=2013-03-05}}</ref> In addition, she regularly hosts an untelevised stage show, titled ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born Vicki Ann Axelrad in [[Inglewood, California]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://delafont.com/specialty_acts/Vicki-Lawrence.htm |title=VICKI LAWRENCE booking – Celebrity Actors, Comedians – Corporate Entertainment Booking|publisher=Delafont.com |date=1949-03-26|access-date=2012-03-31}}</ref> the daughter of Anne Alene (née Loyd) and Howard Axelrad, a certified public accountant for [[Max Factor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/29/Vicki-Lawrence.html|title=Vicki Lawrence Biography |publisher=Filmreference.com|access-date=2012-03-31}}</ref> The family surname was legally changed to "Lawrence" when Vicki was young.<ref name="emmytvlegends.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|access-date=11 May 2015}}</ref> She is a graduate of [[Morningside High School]] in Inglewood, class of 1967. Lawrence had originally planned on being a [[dental hygienist]]. She attended [[UCLA]] while on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', and  changed her major to [[theater arts]], but dropped out after two years.<ref name="emmytvlegends.org"/>

In high school, she auditioned for and got into the musical group [[The Young Americans]]. She stayed with the group almost until the end of high school. By being with the group, she gained experience from touring, performing at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], coming in contact with noteworthy performers such as [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], and performing on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''.<ref name="emmytvlegends.org"/>

In her senior year, she entered the Miss Fireball of Inglewood contest for the local firefighter's ball. A reporter for a local newspaper wrote a story about the contest and stated that Lawrence bore a striking resemblance to a young [[Carol Burnett]]. An avid fan letter-writer, Lawrence's mother urged her to write a letter, which Lawrence did, including the newspaper article.

After receiving the letter, Burnett found Lawrence's father's name in the phone book, called him, and said she would go to see the Miss Fireball contest. Lawrence won the contest and Burnett was called to the stage to crown her. Coincidentally, Burnett was looking for an actress to play her younger sister on [[Carol Burnett Show|her upcoming show]]. After a few months and auditions, Lawrence got the part, specifically for playing Chrissy in the "Carol and Sis" sketches.<ref name="emmytvlegends.org"/>

After Lawrence was given the job on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', both Burnett and [[Harvey Korman]] took her under their wings. Korman taught her various sketch comedy skills, such as listening not just for a cue line, and also coached her in other areas, such as speaking in different accents. Lawrence has credited Korman and Burnett with being her mentors, and has referred to her experience on the show as the "[[Harvard University|Harvard]] school of comedy". Lawrence has stated that she learned show business from Burnett and looked up to her very much, and that the two share a very close friendship.<ref name="emmytvlegends.org"/>

==Career==
===Acting===

[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma "Mama" Harper, 2009]]
As a comedian and actress, Lawrence is known for her work on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After ''The Carol Burnett Show'' ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.

Her portrayal of the Mama character on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' "The Family" sketches was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]'', elaborating on the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the [[Eunice Higgins]] character for the sitcom from time to time.) The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.

Lawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[Major Dad]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''. Between the NBC and syndication runs of ''[[Mama's Family]]'', Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot ''Anything for Love'', which aired as a special on CBS that summer and co-starred [[Lauren Tewes]] and [[Rebeca Arthur]]. Lawrence has also appeared with Burnett, Korman, and [[Tim Conway]] in the Burnett show retrospectives that were broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV special based on ''Nunsense Jamboree'' that originally aired on TNN in 1998.

Lawrence played Mamaw Stewart (the mother of [[Robby Ray Stewart]] and grandmother of [[Jackson Stewart (character)|Jackson]] and [[Miley Stewart]]) in the hit [[Disney]] series ''Hannah Montana'' alongside [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] and his daughter [[Miley Cyrus]].

Lawrence played as Mama in an Ohio commercial, promoting a constitutional amendment that would permit casino gambling in Ohio. Lawrence played Dan's old high-school flame, Phyllis, in an episode of ''Roseanne''. She also appeared in a special celebrity-edition episode of the [[Anne Robinson]] version of ''[[Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|The Weakest Link]]''. Playing for a charity, she made it to the final two but ended up losing to [[Ed Begley, Jr.]]

===Music===
As a singer, Lawrence got her start as one of the scores of hopefuls on the syndicated ''Johnny Mann's Stand Up And Cheer'' program. However, she is most known for her number-one hit, "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia", a song written by her first husband [[Bobby Russell]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which was released on [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] in November 1972. It sold over two million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in April 1973.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> During the last episode of the sixth season of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' (March 24, 1973), Lawrence received her gold record by surprise from Carol Burnett. Her first LP, ''[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia (album)|The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]'', was issued soon after the single went gold. The song was re-recorded by [[Reba McEntire]] for her 1991 album [[For My Broken Heart]]. McEntire released the track as a single to country radio in 1992 and it peaked at No. 12 on the country chart, aided in part by a highly cinematic music video.

"He Did With Me", Lawrence's follow-up to "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia", reached number 75 in the United States, although it reached the top 20 of the [[adult contemporary music]] charts and also became her biggest hit in Australia, peaking at number one there in November 1973. She followed it up there with "Ships in the Night" (1974). In the fall of 1975, Lawrence managed one last minor U.S. chart entry on the [[Private Stock Records|Private Stock]] label with "The Other Woman" (number 81).

In 1974, she recorded her second LP for Bell Records, ''Ships in the Night''. The label was in the process of being bought out by [[Arista Records|Arista]], and the LP was not released in the U.S. The LP was, however, released in Australia, where she continued to have chart success. Lawrence's first two LPs were released as a single CD with bonus tracks on April 1, 2014, by Real Gone Music.

She released a [[disco]] album entitled ''Newborn Woman'' late 1979. The album produced the minor disco hit "Don't Stop the Music".

===Hosting and other work===
As an emcee, she hosted the daytime NBC version of the game show ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'', as well as an unsold pilot for [[Mark Goodson]] Productions, 1990's ''Body Talk'', and has also appeared often as a popular celebrity player on such game shows as ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Password (American game show)|Password]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Password Plus]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Super Password]]'', and various incarnations of the [[Pyramid (game show)|''Pyramid'' game show]], where she was known for verbally sparring with host [[Dick Clark]] on numerous occasions. In one episode, she also left after losing only to return during the closing credits. She also appeared on the 1986-89 version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', where she appeared both as herself and in character as Thelma "Mama" Harper. Lawrence was nominated a number of times for a [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host]] for the eponymous ''[[Vicki!]]'' (1992–1994), but the show ended after two seasons amid creative battles with her syndicator. In 1997, she hosted ''[[Fox After Breakfast]],'' which was renamed ''The Vicki Lawrence Show'',<ref name="Fox After Breakfast">{{cite web |last1=Levin |first1=Mark |title=Fox remakes 'Breakfast'|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/fox-remakes-breakfast-1116678259/ |website=Variety |access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> but was cancelled five weeks later due to low ratings.<ref name="Vicki Lawrence Show">{{cite web |last1=Littlton |first1=Cynthia |title=Fox axes 'Vicki'; ankles ayem|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/fox-axes-vicki-ankles-ayem-111662675/ |website=Variety |access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref>  She was a regular panelist on the 1998 revival of Match Game, but the series only lasted one season.

She tours the country with her "two-woman" show with the first half as herself and the second half done as Mama.  She can also be seen on TV in an infomercial for the Big Boss Grill. She is also known for her voice-over work as Flo on the animated series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]''.

In 2018, Lawrence was seen promoting ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and other classic television series on the [[MeTV]] television network.

==Personal life==
Lawrence was married to singer and songwriter Bobby Russell from 1972 to 1974. Lawrence's second husband is Hollywood make-up artist Al Schultz, to whom she has been married since November 16, 1974, and with whom she has two children, Courtney Allison Schultz (born May 3, 1975) and Garrett Lawrence Schultz (born July 3, 1977).

Lawrence and her family appeared on ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' in July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrity Family Feud:Joey Lawrence vs. Mario Lopez/Ed Asner vs. Vicki Lawrence|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4854762|publisher=IMDb|access-date=2015-08-02}}</ref>

Lawrence was diagnosed with [[chronic idiopathic urticaria]] (CIU) around 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIU&You|url=http://www.ciuandyou.com|publisher=Ciuandyou.com|access-date=2015-03-11}}</ref> She teamed with the [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]] and has become the spokesperson for the campaign CIU & You.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedienne, Actress Vicki Lawrence Teams Up with AAFA To Talk About Chronic Skin Condition|url=http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7388251-aafa-ciu-and-you-campaign|publisher=Multivu.com|access-date=2015-03-11|archive-date=2015-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228193610/http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7388251-aafa-ciu-and-you-campaign/|url-status=dead}}</ref>
