}}
'''The Kelly Family''' is an Irish-American music group consisting of a multi-generational family, usually nine siblings who were joined occasionally on stage in their earlier years by their parents. They play a repertoire of [[Rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[folk music]], and sing fluently in English, Spanish, German, and Basque. The group had chart and concert success around the world, predominantly in [[continental Europe]] - mainly in Germany, the Benelux countries, Scandinavia, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and Portugal - and some in Ireland. They have sold over 20 million albums since the early 1980s and were ranked as the 6th most popular music act in Germany in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=PopXport Ranking: The Top 10 music acts of the 90s from Germany {{!}} PopXport {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 9 December 2016|url=http://www.dw.com/en/popxport-ranking-the-top-10-music-acts-of-the-90s-from-germany/a-18576155|website=DW.COM|access-date=26 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> Despite their American origins, the group is virtually unknown in the United States.<ref name="Keeping it Kelly">{{cite web|title=Keeping it Kelly|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/keeping-it-kelly-1.1526559|website=The Irish Times|access-date=26 March 2017}}</ref>

For many years, the group presented a ragamuffin image and a [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonding]] lifestyle, travelling around Europe in a [[double-decker bus]] and [[houseboat]]. Their image was enhanced by their eclectic and often homemade clothing, and the very long hair worn by both male and female members of the band. The Kelly Family began to break up in 2000 and afterwards they performed mostly as individuals or sub-sets of the whole group and took on a more [[mainstream]] look.

== The Kelly Kids ==
The patriarch of the family, Daniel Kelly Sr., has been described as a "grizzled, ageing [[druid]] aesthetic", but according to his daughter Kathy he was in earlier days "a clean-cut, intense conservative Catholic" who studied for the priesthood.  He married his first wife, Joanne, in 1957, and the couple left their native America in 1965 with their children Daniel Jr., Caroline, Kathleen and Paul, and settled in Spain, where Daniel opened an antiques shop.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Daniel Kelly and Joanne separated, and Joanne returned to America with Daniel Jr., who had a disability.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 1970, Kelly married Barbara Ann Suokko (1946–1982), who was from [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]] and of Finnish and Austrian heritage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mama and Papa Kelly... Barbara and Dan Kelly|url=https://alwaystkf.weebly.com/mama-and-papa-kelly.html|website=~ Always The Kelly Family ~|access-date=1 September 2020}}</ref> Daniel and Barbara had eight children, with the eldest, John, born in 1967, and the youngest, Angelo in 1981. The children were homeschooled and given lessons in music and dance.

In 1974, the older children, Caroline, Daniel, Kathy and Paul, formed '''the Kelly Kids''', at first [[busking]], then performing at parties and local events. They became well-known enough that they appeared on Spanish television in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kelly Family – Biografie|url=http://www.kellyfamily.de/bio_e.php|access-date=26 March 2017|date=18 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918205555/http://www.kellyfamily.de/bio_e.php|archive-date=18 September 2007}}</ref> The band was joined by the younger members of the family as they grew up and learned to play musical instruments.  The band's popularity increased in Spain, with several performances on television and in circuses. In 1976, they went on tour as The Kelly Family, in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Their money was stolen during the tour and, penniless, they had to busk on the streets to earn enough for the return trip home.<ref name="Keeping it Kelly" />

The family moved to Ireland, living at a campground and touring there in 1977. Then, in 1978, they toured again in their authentic [[double-decker bus]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  (They later lived on a large houseboat.)<ref name="Keeping it Kelly" /> Daniel and Barbara Kelly joined their children for performances, Barbara often performing with a newborn in her arms.

In 1977, they landed a record contract in Germany. Their first major chart hit came in 1980, with the song "Who'll Come With Me (David's Song)", with John Kelly, aged 12, singing the solo. The song, with a [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] melody by [[Vladimir Cosma]], was the theme to a German television production ''The Adventures of David Balfour'', based on ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The song hit #1 in the Netherlands and Belgium, and it reached the top 20 in Germany.

Barbara Kelly died of [[breast cancer]] in 1982, shortly after the birth of the youngest child, Angelo. Her last words to her family were "Keep on singing!"{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The band continued to record, Daniel Kelly having formed his own recording company in 1980. As the older members of the family reached adulthood, Caroline and Paul left the band, Caroline to study nursing and Paul to become a chef. In 1990, Daniel Kelly suffered a stroke, but he remained fairly active in the group through the 1990s.

== Fame ==
[[File:The Kelly Family, München.jpg|thumb|300px|The Kelly Family in 2002]]
The Kelly Family covered hit songs such as "[[We are the World]]" and "[[The Rose (song)|The Rose]]", but wrote most of their own music based on family and personal experience, their [[Catholicism|Catholic]] faith, and their worldview.  Songs include "Santa Maria"; "Why, Why, Why"; "An Angel", the video of which popularized a younger family member Paddy; "Break Free", sung by [[Barby Kelly]]; the haunting "Mama", in which Barbara Kelly is remembered by her children; and "The Pee Pee Song", in which the common childhood issue of [[bedwetting]] is portrayed by the raucous, flaxen haired baby-of-the-family Angelo.

In the 1990s, the group enjoyed their biggest success. Their 1994 album ''[[Over the Hump]]'' sold more than 2.25 million copies in Germany alone, and 4.5 million copies throughout Europe. In 1995, to promote the album, they played a concert to a [[Vienna]] audience of 250,000. In the same year they filled the [[Westfalenhalle]], [[Dortmund]], nine times in a row, a feat no other musician has since accomplished. In 1996 they headlined their first Stadium Tour, filling some of Europe's largest venues. They played in [[Beijing]], China in front of 20,000 people. In 1998 they bought a castle, Schloss Gymnich, on the [[Erft]] near [[Cologne]], Germany. About the same time, Adam Kelly, son of Papa Kelly’s younger brother Henry, started performing with his cousins in The Kelly Family.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Success continued until they started to disagree on a professional basis at the beginning of the year 2000. In 2002 Papa Kelly died from yet another stroke. That same year the family competed in the German [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song of Maite Kelly "I wanna be loved" and placed fourth.

In 2002, Barby's ongoing illness forced her retirement from the band and, to the disappointment of his fans, Paddy cut his long hair and joined a religious order in France.  Members of the family continued to perform as soloists or together, or in combination with their partners, as both [[Jimmy Kelly (singer)|Jimmy]] and John married singers.  Fan interest prompted a comeback with gigs in Germany in 2007.

In 2011, the 12 Kelly siblings were reported as living in Ireland, Germany, the United States, Spain, and Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio Angelo|url=http://alwaystkf.weebly.com/bio-angelo.html|website=~ Always The Kelly Family ~|access-date=26 March 2017}}</ref>

== Controversies and issues ==

The Kelly Family has faced criticism and problems. Although singing predominantly in English, the group had little success in the English-speaking world and aroused the derision of critics.  [[Der Spiegel]] called them a "singing second-hand clothes collection" and [[Die Zeit]] called them a cult.<ref name="Keeping it Kelly" /><ref name="irishtimes.com" />

The father, Daniel Kelly, was described, allegedly by his children, as having a "tyrannical, controlling streak".{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}  The most outspoken sibling, Jimmy, has criticized his father for not giving his children a formal education and imposing on them a "Huckleberry Finn" lifestyle.  Moreover, he explained that as The Kelly Family group began to dissolve, there was almost nothing left of the millions of dollars the family had earned.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} The oldest daughter, Kathy, who managed most of the finances of the family, said that Daniel was more "free spirit than tyrant" but that "we got too big too fast, we should have cut things down some or handed over to professional management."<ref name="Keeping it Kelly" />

Dan Kelly taught his children to "always keep independent of the structures of the modern entertainment industry."<ref name="irishtimes.com">{{cite web|title=The man who turned his musical children into recording sensations|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-man-who-turned-his-musical-children-into-recording-sensations-1.1091592|website=The Irish Times|access-date=26 March 2017}}</ref>  He formed his own record label and "the Kellys kept everything in the family, from copyright and bookings to promotion and money matters."<ref name="irishtimes.com" />

The Kellys ran into tax issues in Germany, the "Dan Kelly Foundation" was discovered not to be a registered charity, and they were criticized for their lack of transparency in accounting for money raised for an [[AIDS]] charity.<ref name="irishtimes.com" />

In 2021, Angelo was fined €3,000 by German authorities after his son William performed briefly with him on-stage at an evening concert, in contravention of German labour laws which prohibit children aged under 7 from performing outside the hours of 08:00 to 17:00.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/singer-hit-with-child-labour-fine-after-son-joins-him-on-stage-during-concert-12216241|title=Singer hit with child labour fine after son joins him on stage during concert}}</ref>
