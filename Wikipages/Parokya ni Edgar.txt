'''Parokya ni Edgar''' (lit: Edgar's Parish) is a [[Philippine]] band formed in 1993. The band is known for its original rock [[novelty songs]] and often satirical [[cover version|covers]] of popular songs both foreign and local. The band is adept at playing in various [[musical genre]]s.

Parokya ni Edgar has been referred to by local media outlets and numerous award-giving bodies as "Pambansang Banda ng Pilipinas" (''The National Band of the Philippines'').

Despite having "Edgar" in the band's name, none of the members are named Edgar.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
Originally named '''Comic Relief''', the band's initial members were a group of high school students composed of vocalists [[Chito Miranda]], Jeric Estaco, and [[Vinci Montaner]], along with guitarists Mikko Yap and [[Gab Chee Kee]], all hailing from [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. They were regulars in after-school [[jam sessions]], before performing an opening number for an [[The Eraserheads|Eraserheads]] concert. This served as their break in the music industry and prompted them to add a drummer and bassist – Ateneo schoolmate [[Dindin Moreno]] and Miranda's childhood friend [[Buwi Meneses]], respectively. Around the same time they changed the band's name to Parokya ni Edgar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pinoybanda.com/parokya-ni-Edgar-pinoy-banda-page/ |title=Parokya Ni Edgar Pinoy Banda Page &#124; Free &#124; Downloads &#124; Streaming Videos &#124; Layouts |publisher=Pinoybanda.com |date=June 4, 2007 |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909005156/http://www.pinoybanda.com/parokya-ni-Edgar-pinoy-banda-page/ |archive-date=September 9, 2012 }}</ref> After high school, Mikko and Jeric withdrew from the band to pursue other interests. Soon after, the remaining band members invited [[Darius Semaña]], Meneses's former bandmate, to take the role of lead guitar.

===Career===
====Name origin====
The band name's origin had been a subject of debate among fans as the band members had never given full confirmation. It was not until 2013 that Chito Miranda officially addressed it through a post on their Facebook page. The title "Parokya Ni Edgar" came from a joke a classmate named Bambi Cuna made during one of their high school classes. Sources state that the class subject was Filipino. When the teacher asked Cuna where [[Jose Rizal]]'s fictional hero, Crisostomo Ibarra (in the novel ''[[Noli me tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'') was educated, it was said that Cuna made up a daft answer, "sa Parokya ni Edgar". Then-vocalist Jeric Estaco decided on impromptu to introduce the band as "Parokya ni Edgar" in their first live performance. From there, the band name just stuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/parokyaniedgarofficial/posts/10151443176823300?fref=nf|title=Parokya ni Edgar|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref>

== Activism ==
Parokya joined [[PETA]]'s Free Mali campaign in 2013. "Mali has been sentenced to a miserable life of solitary confinement with absolutely nothing to do day after day, year after year", says lead vocalist Chito Miranda. Scientists, politicians, religious leaders, and tens of thousands of other concerned people have joined PETA in calling for Mali to be freed. "We in Parokya ni Edgar do, too. Even if the elephant exhibit at the Manila Zoo were to be doubled or tripled in size, it would still not be adequate to house one elephant, never mind additional ones. While zoos around the world have spent upwards of 2 billion pesos on attempts at more appropriately sized elephant exhibits, more and more zoos have recognized that the needs of these complex and intelligent animals cannot be met in captivity".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.pep.ph/celeb/people-and-lifestyle/hobbies-and-ventures/28876/parokya-ni-edgar-joins-deafening-call-to-free-mali-the-elephant |title=Parokya Ni Edgar joins deafening call to free Mali the elephant |publisher=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]] |date=August 22, 2013 |access-date=October 26, 2016}}</ref>
