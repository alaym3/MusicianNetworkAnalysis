==Biography==
===1995–2001: Beginnings and mainstream success===

They were eventually signed to [[China Records]]<ref name="Beaujon"/> by Angus Blair (A&R) and the band released their debut ''Trigger Hippie'' EP,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Morcheeba-Trigger-Hippie/master/86730 |title=Morcheeba - Trigger Hippie at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=11 April 2014}}</ref> in October 1995.

(album)|Who Can You Trust?]]'', was released in April 1996 and fitted into the trip hop genre through a combination of Paul Godfrey's [[hip hop]] roots, Ross Godfrey's [[psychedelic rock]] influences and Edwards' [[soul music|soul]]-styled vocals. A second single, "Tape Loop", appeared in July 1996. The band began to play live around Europe and North America,<ref name="tour 1996">{{cite web|url=https://www.songkick.com/artists/496494-morcheeba/gigography?page=25 |title=Morcheeba Gigography, Tour History |publisher=Songkick |access-date=11 April 2014}}</ref> with a live band that included five additional members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/morcheeba/3475|title=Live review - New York City Town Hall|last=Levy|first=Doug|date=16 November 2000|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref> At this point, the band had outgrown the home recording set-up and the brothers purchased their own studio.<ref name="SoundonSound studio">[https://web.archive.org/web/20050410105439/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/dec97/morcheeba.html "Sound On Sound Morcheeba studio 1997"] Sue Sillitoe, 'Morcheeba: From Clapham to The Orb' ''Sound on Sound'', December 1997 (archived 25 November 2016)</ref> In 1997, they contributed to the [[David Byrne]] album [[Feelings (David Byrne album)|''Feelings'']], participating in the recording and production of the release.<ref name="Chaos Control">[http://www.chaoscontrol.com/morcheeba/ "CC interview"] Bob Gourley 'Morcheeba interview with Ross Godfrey', ''Chaos Control magazine'' August 1998</ref><ref name="MTV 1996">[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/508675/david-byrne-collaborates-with-morcheeba.jhtml "Byrne collaboration"] Gil Kaufman 'David Byrne Collaborates With Morcheeba', ''[[MTV]] News (Addicted to Noise)'' 3 December 1996</ref><ref>Beaujon, Andrew (May 1998).

With a more professional recording set-up, the brothers began developing their ideas for a second album. Much of the material had already been written, and, with Norris involved again, the band moved towards a more mainstream sound.<ref name="SoundonSound studio" /> At the same time, Edwards appeared on the [[BBC]] charity single "[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]".<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=227/8}}</ref> The follow-up, 1998's ''[[Big Calm]]'', moved away from trip hop towards a more [[pop music|pop]]-oriented, song-based sound.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> This was exemplified by the band's reworking of "Moog Island" (from their debut) into the pop-song "The Music That We Hear".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/classic-album-morcheeba-on-big-calm-601271|title=Classic album: Morcheeba on Big Calm|date=9 June 2014|newspaper=MusicRadar|access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref> One of the album's singles, "The Sea", became a radio favourite.

In 2000, Morcheeba released their third album, ''[[Fragments of Freedom]]''. This repeated the sales success of ''Big Calm'' but received a less positive critical response. The band's fourth album, ''[[Charango (album)|Charango]]'', was released in 2002 and saw a diminished role for Edwards. The singles "Otherwise" and "Way Beyond" followed. The lyrics for "Undress Me Now" were written with [[Lambchop (band)|Lambchop]]'s [[Kurt Wagner (musician)|Kurt Wagner]], while other collaborators on the album were with rappers Pace Won and [[Slick Rick]].

===2003–2008: Split and ''Dive Deep''===
By the end of 2003, the Godfrey brothers split with Edwards, citing creative and personal differences.<ref name="Gimme Noise">[http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2011/02/morcheeba_the_r.php "Gimme Noise"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530023932/http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2011/02/morcheeba_the_r.php |date=30 May 2013 }} Jen Edwards, 'Morcheeba: The revealing extended interview', ''Gimme Noise'', 13 February 2011</ref> Edwards received "a phone call from our manager saying that it was over. It was a relief to think we didn't have to continue".<ref name="Culture Compass" /> She was under the impression that the band had ceased to operate. A [[greatest hits]] [[compilation album|compilation]], ''[[Parts of the Process]]'', helped to retain interest in the band and featured two new tracks: "What's Your Name" (featuring a rhyming cameo from [[Big Daddy Kane]]) and "Can't Stand It". At around the same time, they released the live DVD ''Morcheeba: From Brixton to Beijing''. A decade later, Ross Godfrey reflected on this period, saying: "We just felt like we couldn't breathe, I'd been in the band and on the road since I was 18, so to have any kind of break from that was just amazing".<ref name="Quietus interview 2013">{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/13531-morcheeba-ross-godfrey-interview |title=Features &#124; A Quietus Interview &#124; Specs, Drugs & Rock & Roll: True Stories Of Morcheeba |publisher=The Quietus |access-date=11 April 2014}}</ref>

The two brothers reunited the year after, leaving Paul to explain that "Ross and I realised that Morcheeba was kind of our family company, and that we wanted very much to keep it going, hence the change".<ref name="music omh">[http://www.musicomh.com/features/interviews/interview-morcheeba "OMH Interview with Paul Godfrey"] Ben Hogwood 'Interview - Morcheeba' music OMH, 3 August 2005</ref> In 2005, Morcheeba released their fifth studio (and first post-Edwards) album, ''[[The Antidote (Morcheeba album)|The Antidote]]''. [[Daisy Martey]] (formerly of the band [[Noonday Underground]]) was recruited to replace Edwards as the album vocalist. However, Martey's period with the band was brief and she was sacked in the middle of the promotional tour, to be replaced by Jody Sternberg. Martey subsequently sued the band for breach of contract and defamation.<ref>[http://www.gigwise.com/news/12091/function.fopen "Gigwise newsitem"] Daniel Melia, 'Former Morcheeba singer sues Bandmate for assault' Gigwise, 5 January 2006</ref> Sternberg's own tenure with the band was similarly brief, and she only appeared to have been part of the band to fulfil tour dates. According to Ross, the entire episode "was difficult to say the least. It left us in near-ruin".<ref name="IndieLDNDive">[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Music-Review/morcheeba-discuss-the-journey-to-dive-deep "Dive Deep interview"] Jack Foley, 'Morcheeba discuss the journey to Dive Deep', ''IndieLondon'', Accessed 21 March 2014.</ref>

After a break of several years, Morcheeba released their sixth studio album, ''[[Dive Deep]]'', in February 2008. On this album, the Godfrey brothers fell back into their role as producers, selecting five vocalists to perform their songs. The folk-rock singer [[Judie Tzuke]], Norwegian born [[Thomas Dybdahl]] and blues singer/guitarist Bradley Burgess appeared as lead vocalists together with the Korean-American rapper [[Cool Calm Pete]] and French singer Manda (Amanda Zamolo).<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Morcheeba-Dive-Deep/release/4540737 "Discogs entry"] Discogs entry for the album with credits, accessed 21 March 2014.</ref> Both Manda and Burgess toured with Morcheeba as lead singers on their 2008 tour.

===2009–2013: Reunion, ''Blood Like Lemonade'' and ''Head Up High''===
As a solo artist, Edwards remained with the same management company as Morcheeba—Chris Morrison the CM of CMO Management represented both artists—which led to a chance meeting in their London offices sometime in 2009. Edwards and the Godfrey brothers met again to discuss her possible involvement in a new project. Initially the singer was hesitant and pointed out that she "really enjoyed doing my solo stuff and writing my own lyrics".<ref name="Guestlisted">[http://guestlisted.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/skye-edwards-morcheeba-interview-2010.html "Guestlisted interview"] Leigh, ''Sky Edwards interview'' (2010), Digging A Hole, 21 August 2010</ref> Eventually, Edwards rejoined the band and the trio began work on a new album,<ref name="Gimme Noise" /> with Edwards still on tour promoting her solo album, Ross Godfrey living in California and Paul Godfrey in France.<ref name="IndieLondon">[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Music-Review/morcheeba-the-indielondon-interview "IndieLondon interview with Paul Godfrey"] 'Morcheeba - The IndieLondon interview', ''IndieLondon'', June 2010</ref> On 12 February 2010, ''[[NME]]'' revealed that Edwards was once again back with the band, which was confirmed by Paul Godfrey the day after on the band's [[Myspace]] blog. Edwards made her live return with the band at the Caprices Festival, Switzerland on 9 April 2010.<ref>[https://www.nme.com/news/morcheeba/49729 "Morcheeba to be rejoined by former singer for first time since 2003"] (news story in ''NME'', 12 February 2010)</ref> Edwards' role in the band changed, as she had "become more confident" in her "ability as a singer and a songwriter", and found that during the recording process they were "more honest with each other", and thus they produced "a more honest record".<ref name="Culture Compass" />

Morcheeba released their seventh album, ''[[Blood Like Lemonade]]'', on PIAS in June 2010, preceded by the single "Even Though". It was produced by Paul Godfrey, who described the album as "a warm, fuzzy blanket of psychedelia", while Edwards described the lyrics as "having dark themes".<ref name="Culture Compass">[http://www.culturecompass.co.uk/2010/06/14/exclusive-skye-edwards-morcheeba/ "Culture Compass: Skye interview 2010"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108234957/http://www.culturecompass.co.uk/2010/06/14/exclusive-skye-edwards-morcheeba/ |date=8 November 2013 }} Leila Hawkins, 'Exclusive, Skye Edwards, Morcheeba', ''Culture Compass'', 14 June 2010</ref> She also remarked on how the brothers had made her part of the creative process again.<ref name=Guestlisted /> An eighteen-month tour followed that saw the band play around the Americas and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joespub.com/component/option,com_shows/task,view/Itemid,40/id,6530 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124051930/http://www.joespub.com/component/option,com_shows/task,view/Itemid,40/id,6530 |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 January 2013 |title=Joe's Pub at The Public - Public Theater |publisher=Joespub.com |access-date=11 April 2014 }}</ref>

===2014–2016: Departure of Paul Godfrey and ''Skye & Ross'' release===
In 2014, Paul Godfrey left the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/blog/skye-ross-interview-2016|title=Skye {{!}} Ross continues on post-Morcheeba|date=23 August 2016|website=PledgeMusic|access-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190811223808/http://www.pledgemusic.com/blog/skye-ross-interview-2016|archive-date=11 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pacificsandiego.com/things-to-do/pac-back-for-more-cheeba-story.html|title=Back for more (Cheeba) |last=McDonald|first=Scott|date=3 September 2016|website=Pacificsandiego.com|access-date=11 August 2019}}</ref> Ross Godfrey later explained that: "Paul and I had not been getting on musically, or personally for a long time, and after the ''Head Up High'' album in 2013, Paul told us he was leaving the band, and he wanted Skye and I to buy him out of his share of the name. We disagreed on how much it was worth so no deal was struck. Skye and I thought it best to just release the record we had made under our own names. There will be no more Morcheeba albums".<ref name=":0"/> Paul Godfrey has since established a recording studio, Sacrosync Sound, in Hastings and recorded a new album "Cool Your Soul" with Rachel Cuming under the moniker Morcheeba Productions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/paul_godfrey_selects_penn_elcom_for_new_studio/recording|title=Paul Godfrey Selects Penn Elcom For New Studio - Pro Sound Web|access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lsionline.co.uk/news/story/Penn-Elcom-gets-wired-for-new-studio/-WIJ8DH|title=Penn Elcom gets wired for new studio -|date=22 July 2016|newspaper=LSi Online|access-date=25 November 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126004156/http://www.lsionline.co.uk/news/story/Penn-Elcom-gets-wired-for-new-studio/-WIJ8DH|archive-date=26 November 2016}}</ref>
