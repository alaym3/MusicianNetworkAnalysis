'''Deborah Ann Harry''' (born '''Angela Trimble'''; July 1, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter and actress, known as the lead vocalist of the band [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]. Her recordings with the band reached {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}} in the US and UK charts on many occasions from 1979 to 2017.

Born in Miami, Florida, Harry was adopted as an infant and raised in [[Hawthorne, New Jersey]]. After attending college, she worked various jobs, including as a secretary (including at the BBC in New York), dancer, and [[Playboy Bunny]], before breaking through in the music industry. Harry co-formed Blondie in 1974 in New York City. The band released their [[Blondie (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1976, and released a further three albums between then and 1979, including ''[[Parallel Lines]]'', which spawned six singles, including "[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]". Their fifth record, ''[[Autoamerican]]'' (1980), afforded Harry and the band further attention, spawning such hits as a cover of "[[The Tide Is High]]", and "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]", the latter of which is considered the first rap song to chart at number one in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&pg=PT549 |page=549 |title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits |last=Bronson |first=Fred |publisher=Billboard Books |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-823-07677-2}}</ref>

In 1981, Harry released her debut solo album, ''[[KooKoo]]'', and, during a hiatus of Blondie, embarked on an acting career, appearing in lead roles in the neo-noir ''[[Union City (film)|Union City]]'' (1980) and in [[David Cronenberg]]'s [[body horror]] film ''[[Videodrome]]'' (1983). She released her second solo album, ''[[Rockbird]]'', in 1986, and subsequently starred in [[John Waters]]'s cult dance film ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' (1988). Harry went on to release two more solo albums between then and 1993, after which she returned to film with roles in a [[John Carpenter]]-directed segment of the horror film ''[[Body Bags (film)|Body Bags]]'' (1993), and in the drama ''[[Heavy (film)|Heavy]]'' (1995).

Blondie reunited in the late 1990s, releasing ''[[No Exit (Blondie album)|No Exit]]'' (1999), followed by ''[[The Curse of Blondie]]'' (2003). Harry continued to appear in independent films throughout the 2000s, including ''[[Deuces Wild]]'' (2002), ''[[My Life Without Me]]'' (2003) and ''[[Eulogy (film)|Eulogy]]'' (2008). With Blondie, she released the group's ninth studio album, ''[[Panic of Girls]]'', in 2011, followed by ''[[Ghosts of Download]]'' (2014). The band's eleventh studio album, 2017's ''[[Pollinator (album)|Pollinator]]'', charted at number 4 in the United Kingdom.

===1966–1975: Early projects; formation of Blondie===
{{main|Blondie (band)}}
In the late 1960s, Harry began her musical career as a backing singer for the [[folk rock]] group [[The Wind in the Willows (band)|The Wind in the Willows]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/1333895|title=The Wind In The Willows|website=Discogs.com}}</ref> which released an eponymous album in 1968 on [[Capitol Records]].<ref>The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia Of Rock & Roll c1983, page 48.</ref>

In 1974, Harry joined the Stilettoes with Elda Gentile and Amanda Jones. Shortly thereafter, the band added guitarist [[Chris Stein]], who became her boyfriend.<ref>Stevie Chick, ''Psychic Confusion: The Sonic Youth Story'' (Omnibus Press, 2007). {{ISBN|978-0-85712-054-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/blondie?template=RBMA_Lecture%2Ftranscript |title=Debbie Harry and Chris Stein |publisher=Red Bull Music Academy |date=December 9, 2011 |access-date=December 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903215221/http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/blondie?template=RBMA_Lecture%2Ftranscript |archive-date=September 3, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/blondie/bio/ |title=Blondie Biography |publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=December 4, 2013}}</ref> In her memoir, ''Face It'', Harry describes having been raped at knifepoint during a burglary of the home she shared with Stein.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://etcanada.com/news/483684/blondie-singer-debbie-harry-details-horrifying-sexual-assault-in-the-1970s/|work=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807075215/https://etcanada.com/news/483684/blondie-singer-debbie-harry-details-horrifying-sexual-assault-in-the-1970s/|archive-date=August 7, 2019|url-status=live|title=Blondie Singer Debbie Harry Details Horrifying Sexual Assault In The 1970s|last=Furdyk|first=Brent|date=August 3, 2019}}</ref>

After leaving the Stilettoes, Harry and Stein formed Angel and the Snake with Tish Bellomo and Snooky Bellomo. Shortly thereafter, Harry and Stein formed [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], named after the catcall men often directed at Harry after she bleached her hair blonde.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://culture.bitchbuzz.com/blondie-panic-of-girls.html|title=Blondie: Panic of Girls|last=Beckett|first=Warren|date=May 23, 2011|publisher=BitchBuzz|quote='Blondie' from what men would shout at her in the street|access-date=June 3, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313032437/http://culture.bitchbuzz.com/blondie-panic-of-girls.html|archive-date=March 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band quickly became regulars at Max's Kansas City and [[CBGB]] in New York City.<ref name="max"/>

===1976–1980: Global success===
With her beauty, daring choice of clothing, and two-tone bleached-blonde hair, Harry quickly became a punk icon.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/story/2011-09-02/On-the-Road-Again-Blondie/50251934/1 | title = On the Road Again: Blondie | work = USA Today | date= September 2, 2011 |access-date = September 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintag.es/2018/10/debbie-harry-on-stage-1970s.html|title=30 Hottest Photographs of Debbie Harry on Stage From the Mid-1970s|website=Vintag.es|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-09}}</ref>

In June 1979, Blondie was featured on the cover of ''Rolling Stone''. Harry's persona, combining cool sexuality with streetwise style, became so closely associated with the group's name that many came to believe "Blondie" was the singer's name. The difference between the individual Harry and the band Blondie was emphasized by a "Blondie is a group" [[pin-back button|button]] campaign by the band in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rip-her-to-shreds.com/archive_press_magazines_rm28april79.php|title=More Males Per Oxide|publisher=[[Record Mirror]] (mirrored at Blondie fansite)|date=April 28, 1979|access-date=September 26, 2006|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69h56kepT?url=http://www.rip-her-to-shreds.com/archive_press_magazines_rm28april79.php|archive-date=August 5, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It also reached {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}} in the UK and was the second highest-selling single of 1979. The band's success continued with the release of the platinum-selling ''[[Eat to the Beat]]'' album (UK {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}}, US {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}17}}) in 1979.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Blondie |last1=Coleman |first1=Mark |last2=Berger |first2=Arion |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9eocwUfoSoC&pg=PA85 |access-date=September 23, 2011 |title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]] |editor1-last=Brackett |editor1-first=Nathan |editor2-last=Hoard |editor2-first=Christian |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |edition=4th |year=2004 |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/85 85–86] }}</ref>

''[[Autoamerican]]'' (UK {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}3}}, US {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}7}}) was released in 1980. Blondie had further {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}} hits with "[[Call Me (Blondie song)|Call Me]]" ([[American Gigolo (soundtrack)|''American Gigolo'' soundtrack]]) (US and UK {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}}), "[[Atomic (song)|Atomic]]" (''Eat to the Beat'' album) (UK {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}}), "[[The Tide Is High]]" (US and UK {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}}), and "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]" (US {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}}).

During this time, both Harry and Stein befriended [[graffiti]] artist [[Fab Five Freddy]], who introduced them to the emerging hip-hop scene in the Bronx.

Harry was immortalized by [[Andy Warhol]] in 1980, who produced a number of artworks of her image from a single photoshoot at [[the Factory]]. The artist created a small series of four acrylic and silkscreen ink on canvas portraits of the star in different colors, as well as Polaroids and a small number of rare [[Gelatin silver process|silver gelatin]] prints from the shoot. Stein was also present that day to capture Warhol photographing Harry in a series of his own photographs, exhibited in 2013 in London.

Her collaboration and friendship with Warhol continued and she was his first guest on the MTV show ''[[Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes]]''. The first episode opened with Harry announcing the theme: "Sex, Vegetables, Brothers and Sisters".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-mtv-andy-warhol-broke-rules|title=On His MTV Show, Andy Warhol Broke All the Rules|last=Gotthardt|first=Alexxa|date=2017-11-21|work=Artsy|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}</ref>

Harry said of her relationship with Warhol, "I think the best thing [Andy Warhol] taught me was always to be open to new things, new music, new style, new bands, new technology and just go with it. Never get mired in the past and always accept new things whatever age you are."{{sfn|Porter|Needs|2012|loc=chpt. 8}}

===1981–1987: Solo work and acting===
In 1981, Harry issued a press release to clarify that her name was not "Debbie Blondie" or "Debbie Harry" but rather Deborah Harry, though Harry later described her character in the band as being named "Blondie", as in this quote from the ''No Exit'' tour book:{{blockquote|Hi, it's Deb. You know, when I woke up this morning I had a realization about myself. I was always Blondie. People always called me Blondie, ever since I was a little kid. What I realized is that at some point I became [[Dirty Harry]]. I couldn't be Blondie anymore, so I became Dirty Harry.<ref>D Harry, No Exit Tour Book, (New York: Blondie Music, Inc., 1999).</ref>}}

Harry began her solo career with the album ''[[KooKoo]]'' (1981). Produced by [[Nile Rodgers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]], the album peaked at {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}25}} in the US and {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}6}} in the UK;<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Giger]] (who also created the album's front cover featuring Harry's face with metal skewers through it). The single reached {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}43}} on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}29}} on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]], and {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}32}} on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> "[[The Jam Was Moving]]" was lifted as the second single and peaked at No.&nbsp;82 in the US.

After a year-long hiatus, Blondie regrouped and released their sixth studio album, ''[[The Hunter (Blondie album)|The Hunter]]'' (1982). The album was not as successful as their previous works, and a world tour was cut short due to slow ticket sales. It was around this time that Stein also fell seriously ill with the rare autoimmune disease [[pemphigus]]. His illness, along with declining record sales and internal struggles, caused the band to split up.

In June 1982, Harry contributed backing vocals to The Gun Club's second album ''[[Miami (The Gun Club album)|Miami]]'', being credited as 'D.H. Lawrence Jr' while Chris Stein also produced the record, and is credited as 'bongos' and 'cover photos/design'. The Gun Club's singer [[Jeffrey Lee Pierce]] was an ardent fan, emulating Harry's hairstyle and founding the West Coast Blondie Fan Club, before becoming friends with the band in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/digimeister/28430100535/|title=THE GUN CLUB MIAMI ANIMAL RECORDS 12" LP VINYL|date=November 17, 2012|access-date=September 18, 2020|website=Flickr.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eddiesrockmusic.wordpress.com/2018/11/26/g-is-forthe-gun-club-miami/|title=G is for…The Gun Club!

After Blondie split up in 1982, Harry's solo output slowed down as she cared for ailing partner Chris Stein. She released the single "Rush Rush" in 1983 (produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]] and taken from the film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''), but it was commercially unsuccessful. The same year, Harry had a leading role in [[David Cronenberg]]'s [[body horror]] film ''[[Videodrome]]'' (1983), playing the sadomasochistic lover of a television producer who uncovers an underground video output of [[snuff film]]s.<ref name=beyond>{{cite web|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Debbie Harry, On Beyond Blondie|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1986/11/30/debbie-harry-on-beyond-blondie/2e0a64be-7de6-4ad6-a982-654bf2311752/|author=Harrington, Richard|date=November 30, 1986|archive-url=https://archive.today/20191009031904/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1986/11/30/debbie-harry-on-beyond-blondie/2e0a64be-7de6-4ad6-a982-654bf2311752/|archive-date=October 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Harry received rave reviews for her performance in the film.<ref name=beyond/> Critic Howard Hampton noted in a retrospective that Harry "carries herself with the wry, burned-out, but still titillated instincts of a voyager buying a one-way ticket for the outer limits. A vivid, smallish part can either anchor or undo a risky, conceptually spiky film like David Cronenberg's viscerally deranged phantasia: Harry's presence grounds it in acute, self-aware reality."<ref>{{Cite web|work=[[Criterion Collection]]|last=Hampton|first=Howard|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4357-experience-necessary-deborah-harry-in-videodrome|date=December 27, 2016|title=Experience Necessary: Deborah Harry in ''Videodrome''|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20191009033016/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4357-experience-necessary-deborah-harry-in-videodrome|archive-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref>

A new single, "Feel The Spin" (taken from the film ''[[Krush Groove]]''), was released as a limited 12" single in 1985, but it was unsuccessful. In 1986, Harry released her second solo album, called ''[[Rockbird]]'', which peaked at {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}97}} in the US, and {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}31}} in the UK<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> (where it has been certified gold for 100,000 sales by the BPI). The single "[[French Kissin' (song)|French Kissin' in the USA]]" gave Harry her only UK solo top 10 hit ({{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}8}}) and became a moderate US hit ({{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}57}}). Other singles released from the album were "[[Free to Fall]]" and "[[In Love with Love]]", which hit {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}} on the US Dance Charts and was released with several remixes.

In 1987, Harry starred opposite [[Alec Baldwin]] in the comedy mystery film ''[[Forever, Lulu (1987 film)|Forever, Lulu]]'', playing the title character.

===1988–1996: Blondie reunion, solo, and further acting===
"Liar, Liar" was recorded by Harry for the soundtrack album ''[[Married to the Mob]]'' in 1988 and was produced by Mike Chapman. It was their first collaboration since the 1982 Blondie album ''The Hunter''. The same year, Harry starred as Velma Von Tussle in [[John Waters]]'s satirical dance film ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]''.

Her next solo venture was the album ''[[Def, Dumb and Blonde]]'' in 1989. At this point Harry reverted from "Debbie" to "Deborah" as her professional name. The first single "[[I Want That Man]]" was a hit in Europe and Australia and on the US Modern Rock Charts. The success of the single propelled the album to {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}12}} on the UK chart,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> where it earned a silver disc. However, with little promotion from her record company in the US, it peaked at {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}123}}. She followed this up with the ballad "[[Brite Side]]" and the club hit "[[Sweet and Low (Deborah Harry song)|Sweet and Low]]". "[[Maybe for Sure]]", a reworked version of "Angel's Song" she'd recorded for the ''[[Rock and Rule]]'' animated film, was the fourth single released from the album in June 1990 to coincide with a UK tour (her second in six months). The track "[[Kiss It Better (Deborah Harry song)|Kiss It Better]]" was also a Top 15 Modern Rock single in the US.

Harry also appeared in film during this time, with a supporting part in ''[[Tales from the Darkside: The Movie]]'' (1990). From 1989 to 1991, Harry toured extensively across the world with former Blondie guitarist Chris Stein, [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]'s [[Karl Hyde]], and future Blondie bassist Leigh Foxx. In July 1991 she played Wembley Stadium, supporting [[INXS]]. In 1991, Chrysalis released a new "best of" compilation in Europe entitled ''[[The Complete Picture: The Very Best of Deborah Harry and Blondie]]'', containing hits with Blondie as well as her solo hits. The collection reached {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}3}} in the UK album chart<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and earned a gold disc. The album also included her duet with [[Iggy Pop]] of the [[Cole Porter]] song "[[Well, Did You Evah!]]" from the 1990 ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' [[AIDS]] charity album.

While recording her fourth album, ''[[Debravation]]'', in 1992, Harry collaborated with German [[post-punk]] band [[Die Haut]] on the track "Don't Cross My Mind" and released the song "[[Prelude to a Kiss (song)|Prelude to a Kiss]]" on the soundtrack to the [[Prelude to a Kiss (film)|film of the same name]]. She also released a cover of "[[Summertime Blues]]" from the soundtrack to the film ''[[That Night]]'' in Australia. ''Devotion'' was ultimately released in July 1993. The album's first single was "[[I Can See Clearly]]", which peaked at {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}23}} in the UK<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}2}} on the US dance charts. This was followed by "[[Strike Me Pink]]" in September. Controversy surrounded the latter track's promotional video, which featured a man drowning in a water tank, resulting in its being banned. US editions of the album feature two additional tracks recorded with prerecorded music by [[R.E.M.]]: "Tear Drops" and a cover of [[Skeeter Davis]]'s 1961 hit "[[My Last Date (with You)]]". Also in 1993, Harry had a supporting role in a [[John Carpenter]]-directed segment of the anthology horror film ''[[Body Bags (film)|Body Bags]]''.

In November 1993, Harry toured the UK with Stein, guitarist Peter Min, bassist Greta Brinkman, and drummer James Murphy. The set list of the Debravation Tour featured an offbeat selection of Harry material including the previously unreleased track "Close Your Eyes" (from 1989) and "Ordinary Bummer" (from the Stein-produced Iggy Pop album ''[[Zombie Birdhouse]]'', a track that, under the moniker Adolph's Dog, Blondie covered in 1997). Tentative plans to record these shows and release them as a live double CD never came to fruition. However, covers of [[the Rolling Stones]]' "[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]" and [[David Oliver (singer)|David Oliver]]'s "[[Love T.K.O.|Love TKO]]" exist as bootlegs. In early 1994, Harry took the Debravation tour to the US.<ref>{{cite web| title=Deborah Harry Solo Appearances (gig list) | url=http://archive.blondie.net/gig_list_debbie_harry_solo.php|website=Archive.blondie.net}}</ref> In the UK, Harry's long tenure with Chrysalis Records also came to an end after ''Debravation''{{'s}} lackluster sales, but the label released all of Blondie's albums and Harry's ''KooKoo'' album (for the first time on CD) as remastered editions with bonus tracks.

In the mid 1990s, Harry worked as a guest vocalist on several projects: She joined the avant-garde jazz ensemble [[the Jazz Passengers]] in 1994, appearing on their album ''In Love'' (1994). Harry also reunited with Blondie keyboardist Jimmy Destri for a cover of [[Otis Blackwell]]'s "Don't Be Cruel" for the 1995 album ''Brace Yourself! A Tribute to Otis Blackwell''. During this period, she also recorded a duet with actor Robert Jacks titled "Der Einziger Weg (The Only Way)", a theme for the horror film ''[[Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation]]'' (1994), which was recorded in German and in English. Harry also served as a vocalist in the [[Talking Heads]]' side project [[The Heads (band)|the Heads]]' 1996 release ''[[No Talking, Just Head]]'', followed by the Jazz Passengers' ''Individually Twisted'' (1997). The same year, she collaborated with Jazz Passengers' Bill Ware in his side project Groove Thing, singing lead vocals on the club hit "Command and Obey". Another Jazz Passengers collaboration, "[[The City in the Sea]]", appeared on the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] tribute album ''[[Closed on Account of Rabies]]'' (1997).

In film, Harry co-starred with [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] and [[Liv Tyler]] in [[James Mangold]]'s directorial debut ''[[Heavy (film)|Heavy]]'' (1995), playing a misanthropic waitress at an upstate New York restaurant. The following year, she filmed Mangold's ''[[Cop Land]]'' (1997), a neo-noir thriller in which she portrayed a bartender.

[[File:Blondie (Roskilde Festival 1999) (3668215198).jpg|thumb|left|Harry performing with Blondie at [[Roskilde Festival]], 1999]]
In 1997, Blondie began working together again for the first time in 15&nbsp;years. The four original members (Harry, Stein, [[Clem Burke]] and [[Jimmy Destri]]) began sessions for what would become Blondie's seventh studio album, ''[[No Exit (Blondie album)|No Exit]]'' (1999). The lead single from the album, "[[Maria (Blondie song)|Maria]]", debuted at {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}} in the UK, giving Blondie their sixth UK {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}} hit. "Maria" also reached {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}1}} in 14 different countries, the top 10 on the US Dance Charts, and Top 20 on the US Adult Top 40 Charts. ''No Exit'' debuted at {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}3}} in the UK and {{nobr|No.{{space|hair}}17}} in the US.

Harry appears on the 2001 [[Bill Ware]] album ''Vibes 4'' singing the track "Me and You" as well as on former [[The Police|Police]] guitarist [[Andy Summers]]'s album ''Peggy's Blue Skylight'' on the track "Weird Nightmare". A [[techno]] cover of [[Stan Jones (songwriter)|Stan Jones]]' "[[Ghost Riders in the Sky]]" was featured on the soundtrack to the 1998 film ''[[Three Businessmen]]'', and was available on her website to download. Harry sings on two tracks on Andrea Griminelli's ''Cinema Italiano'' project: "You'll Come to Me" (inspired by ''[[Amarcord]]'''s main theme) and "When Love Comes By" (from ''[[Il Postino]]''), as well as on a tribute album reinterpreting the music of [[Harold Arlen]], on which she sings the title track "[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]]". In May 2002, she accompanied the Jazz Passengers and the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] in a performance of her jazz material at the [[Barbican Centre]] in London. In 2003, she was featured vocalist on the song "Uncontrollable Love" by DJ duo [[Blow-Up (DJ duo)|Blow-Up]]. She also sang on the version of "[[Waltzing Matilda]]" recorded by [[Dan Zanes and Friends]], released on the 2003 album ''House Party''. The same year, Blondie released the album ''[[The Curse of Blondie]]'' (2003).

In 2006, Harry started work in New York City on her fifth solo album, ''[[Necessary Evil (Deborah Harry album)|Necessary Evil]]'' (released in 2007). Working with production duo Super Buddha (who produced the remix of Blondie's "[[In the Flesh (Blondie song)|In the Flesh]]" for the 2005 ''[[Greatest Hits: Sound & Vision|Sound and Vision]]'' compilation), the first music to surface in was a [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] track titled "Dirty and Deep" in which she spoke out against rapper [[Lil' Kim]]'s incarceration. Throughout 2006, a number of new tracks surfaced on Harry's [[Myspace]] page, including "Charm Alarm", "Deep End", "Love with a Vengeance", "School for Scandal", and "Necessary Evil", as well as duets she recorded with [[Miss Guy]] (of [[Toilet Böys]] fame), "God Save New York" and "New York Groove". A streaming version of the lead single, "[[Two Times Blue]]", was added to Harry's Myspace page in May 2007. On June 6, 2007, a downloadable version was released via her official website.

In 2007, she delineated the different personae (Blondie the band, her role in the band, and Deborah Harry the singer) to an interviewer who asked why she played only solo music on the 2007 [[True Colors World Tour]] with [[Cyndi Lauper]]: "I've put together a new trio with no Blondie members in it. I really want to make a clear definition between Debbie's solo projects and Blondie, and I hope that the audience can appreciate that and also appreciate this other material."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deborahharry.com/news.shtml|title=Three questions with Debbie Harry...|publisher=Las Vegas Weekly (mirrored at official Deborah Harry web site)|date=June 7, 2007|access-date=July 4, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69h588W5C?url=http://www.deborahharry.com/news.shtml|archive-date=August 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
