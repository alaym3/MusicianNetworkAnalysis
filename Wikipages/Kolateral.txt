==Background==
{{See also|Philippine drug war}}
The Philippine Drug War, which is the ongoing drug policy of the Philippine government under President Duterte, has been pointed out by critics on its effects on the [[Human rights in the Philippines|human rights situation of the Philippines]]. The number of those who have been killed range from the official government figures of 5,104<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.untvweb.com/videos/critics-hit-dutertes-promise-to-continue-campaign-against-drugs/|title=Critics hit Duterte's promise to continue campaign against drugs|website=UNTV News and Rescue|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> to as many about 29,000 classified as "deaths under inquiry."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/nation/2019/03/06/1898959/29000-deaths-probed-drug-war-launched|title=29,000 deaths probed since drug war launched|website=philstar.com|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref> After three years since the start of Duterte's term in 2016, research and activism has led to various artists to collaborate to make the ''Kolateral'' album. The album was made to recognize the abuses of the drug war, as well as to call for action.<ref name=":0" />

== Songs ==
The album features twelve tracks regarding the adverse effects of the ongoing drug war.<ref name=":0" />

The opening track is entitled ''"Makinarya"'' ({{literal translation|Machinery}}), which offers a glimpse on the workings of the drug war under the command of President Duterte.

The next three tracks and the sixth track offer narratives regarding the effects of the drug war on the lives of affected sectors. ''"Boy"'' (a common street nickname in the Philippines for boys) is about young street folk. ''"Distansya"'' ({{literal translation|Distance}}) retells the experiences of an [[overseas Filipino worker]] (OFW) working in Kuwait named Luzviminda Siapo who had a child back in the Philippines. Her nineteen year-old son, named Raymart, was abducted and killed on March 29, 2017 because their neighbor accused him of peddling [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. The song laments on how the government praises OFWs while disregarding the domestic human rights situation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.philrights.org/sandatas-kolateral-a-brave-retelling-of-dutertes-so-called-war-on-drugs/|title=Sandata's Kolateral: A brave retelling of Duterte's so-called war on drugs|last=Staff|first=PhilRights|date=2019-09-03|website=Philippine Human Rights Information Center|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> In the song, she questions how someone with a disability can be a drug pusher. This refers to how Raymart suffered from [[Clubfoot|club feet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/606479/news/metro/man-with-club-feet-shot-dead-after-being-taunted-to-run/|title=Man with club feet shot dead after being taunted to run|website=GMA News Online|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> ''"Papag"'' ({{literal translation|Sleeping Mat}}) is about an urban poor family. ''"Hawak"'' ({{literal translation|Hold}}) is based on the story of couple Jerico and Angel who were killed because of the drug war.<ref name=":1" />

''"Giyera Na Bulag"'' ({{literal translation|Blind War}}) talks about how the drug war anonymously targets the poor for the said government policy, as well as the anonymity of the perpetrators. It aims to expose how policemen killed many people to meet certain quotas.<ref name=":1" /> ''"Pagsusuma"'' ({{literal translation|Summary}}) sums up and raises questions on the drug war's contradictions. The eight and ninth songs identify and point out to the executioners of the human rights violations. "Neo-Manila" claims and narrates how the police and local government officials are involved in the drug war on the street-level, while ''"Parasitikong Abusado"'' ({{literal translation|Abusive Parasites}}) points out that the drug war is big business for the alleged main perpetrators of government fascism, including Duterte himself.

The last three songs call for action. ''"Walang Maiiwan"'' ({{literal translation|No One Left Behind}}) calls the urban poor towards inclusion and resistance. "Stand By" explores the economic roots of why there are ''[[wikt:tambay|tambay]]'' (derogatory term for idle or jobless people) and rallies them against these causes. The song is in reference to the a related government campaign policy, ''Oplan Tambay'', in which officials managed to arrest about 8,000 bystanders who were said to have violated local city ordinances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/06/22/Genesis-Argoncillo-tambay-Quezon-City-police-murder.html|title=QC Police chief expects more suspects to be charged in Genesis Argoncillo's death|website=cnn|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> The song opposes how the government uses the poor again and again as scapegoat. The last song, ''"Sandata"'' ({{literal translation|Weapon}}), features nine rappers with their own verses, which makes it the longest song in the album. The song is noted to feature uncensored Tagalog and English [[Tagalog profanity|profanity]], explicitly directed against Duterte himself. It starts and ends with lines that advocate for its listeners to tear down the "fascist government" and the "rotten system." ''"Sandata"'' ends with door knock sound effects, which are the exact sound effects that kicks off ''"Makinarya,"'' the opening track. The door knock sound effects are in reference to ''Oplan Tokhang'', a component policy of the drug war, in which the term ''[[wikt:tokhang|tokhang]]'' is from the merger of two [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words ''toktok'', which means knock, and ''hangyo'', which means plead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/10/26/tokhang-named-2018-word-of-the-year.html|title='Tokhang' named 2018 Word of the Year|website=cnn|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>

The album cover was a photograph by Kimberly dela Cruz of a mural of Archie Oclos in Sitio San Roque, an urban poor community in [[Quezon City]] that is said to have also experienced cases of killings relating to the drug war. BLKD encouraged his followers on twitter to integrate with the community as it also faces threats of demolitions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/imblkd/status/1145662648429580291|title=Album art na literal na pwedeng puntahan?

On July 23, 2019, Calix performed ''"Giyera Na Bulag"'' to serve as the ending performance of the [[Protests against Rodrigo Duterte#2019|protest]] against the [[2019 State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|2019]] [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]] (SONA) of President Duterte.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/07/23/tens-of-thousands-brave-the-rain-threats-from-govt-to-protest-state-of-the-nation/|title=Tens of thousands brave the rain, threats from gov't, to protest state of the nation|last=Umil|first=Anne Marxze|date=2019-07-23|website=Bulatlat|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref>
