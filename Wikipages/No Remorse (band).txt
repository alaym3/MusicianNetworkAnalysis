'''No Remorse''' were an English neo-Nazi and [[Rock Against Communism]] (RAC) band led by singer Paul Bellany (son of Scottish artist [[John Bellany]]), aka Paul Burnley.

The band formed in the mid '80s. The initial line-up included Mark Vince on guitar and Stewart Baile (also known as Stew) on drums. This line-up was short-lived – however, they did record a demo. The band re-formed in November 1986, after Vince met Burnley at a [[Skrewdriver]] concert in Surrey in October 1986. At the time Burnley compiled the skinhead fanzine ''The Truth at Last'' and had previously fronted the [[Oi!]] band Public Enemy (who had an LP released on [[Rock-O-Rama Records]]). Burnley's elder brother John (who also used the pseudonym ''Burnley'') was already a bandmember, as their drummer. The re-formed line-up was completed with Archie from Northern Ireland on bass and Baile from Essex on drums.<ref name="Forbes">R. Forbes & E. Stampton, "The White Nationalist Skinhead Movement: UK & USA, 1979 - 1993", Feral House, 2015</ref>

Their debut album, This Time The World, was released in 1988, and later that year the band recorded See you in Valhalla after changing record label from [[Rebelles Européens]] to Rock-O-Rama Records. In 1989 they recorded the albums The New Stormtroopers and Blood Against Gold. Their album Blood Against Gold was released in 1990, and for the first time, No Remorse performed in North America; first in [[Ottawa]], Canada, and then at Aryan Fest in [[Oklahoma]], USA. In 1991 Australian musician Nigel Brown (formerly of RAC band White Lightning) joined the band.

In 1992 they accompanied the Swedish RAC band Dirlewanger at a festival in [[Brandenburg]], Germany. In September they travelled to California, USA with Dirlewanger, where they performed together and recorded the album Desert Storm. The band recorded Farewell Ian Stuart in April 1994, and they signed for to Movement Records and Nordland Records. They recorded the album Under The Gods for Nordland Records, and Movement Records released Skinhead Army. Later that year, they performed at A Tribute to Ian Stuart in [[Racine, Wisconsin]], USA accompanied by Bound for Glory, Centurion, RaHoWa and Berserkr. Following the concert, Joe Rowan, singer of Nordic Thunder, was murdered at a gas station.

In 1995, Nordland Records released Under The Gods, and Resistance Records released The Best of No Remorse. Movement Records encountered economic troubles and sold the rights to European Skinhead Army to Nordland. The Winning Hand (the renamed version of European Skinhead Army) was released in 1996.

==Line-ups==
*Paul Burnley (vocals), Sean Heywood (guitar), Mark Vince (guitar), Archie (bass), Stewart Baile (drums).
This line-up recorded their first two LPs; This Time The World (released in 1988) and Smash The Reds! (released in 1989). Heywood was the guitarist on Brutal Attack's second LP As The Drum Beats.

*Paul Burnley (vocals), Mark Vince (guitar), Gary Smith (bass), Rob (drums)
This line-up recorded the LPs The New Storm Troopers, See You in Valhalla (both released in 1989) and Blood Against Gold (released in 1991).

==Legal==
In 1998 Leighton Gareth Jones was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for producing the No Remorse CD Barbecue in Rostock after [[Searchlight (magazine)|''Searchlight'']] forced the CD manufacturers into calling in the police.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/stories/LondonBomberJune.htm |title=Policing far-right terror |work=Searchlight |date=June 1999 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618041703/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/stories/LondonBomberJune.htm#police |archivedate=18 June 2004 }}</ref>

In July 2006 Jersey Customs officers intercepted a package of 100 No Remorse CDs sent from Poland. The albums, entitled Deutschland, contained inflammatory racist and anti-Semitic lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2009/11/21/2000-was-for-gigs-not-racist-cds/ |title=£2000 was for gigs not racist CDs |work=Jersey Evening Post |date=21 November 2009}}</ref> William Browning and Jon Denny-Mallen were both accused of one charge of conspiracy to distribute material with intent to stir up racial hatred between 1 January and 13 July 2006 by importing the CDs from Poland into Jersey. They both denied the offence. In November 2009 Denny-Mallen was acquitted by a jury at [[Southwark Crown Court]]. The jury failed to reach a verdict in the case against Browning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2009/11/27/tattooist-acquitted/ |title=Tattooist acquitted of racial hate plot |work=Jersey Evening Post |date=27 November 2009}}</ref>
