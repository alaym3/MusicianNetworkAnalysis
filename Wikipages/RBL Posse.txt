'''RBL Posse''' was a [[gangsta rap]] group from the [[Hunters Point, San Francisco, California|Hunters Point]] section in [[San Francisco, California]]. The members were Black C, Mr. Cee, and Hitman. They were active from 1991 to 2003.

==History==
RBL Posse was formed in 1991 by Black C (Christian Mathews) and Mr. Cee (Kyle Church). Their first release, the self-produced "Don't Give Me No Bammer" came out on In-a-Minute Records and made the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine [[Hot Rap Tracks|Hot Rap Singles]] chart, peaking at #16.<ref name=billboard>[http://www.billboard.com/artist/277282/rbl+posse/chart "RBL Posse: Chart History."] [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]. ''www.billboard.com.'' Retrieved February 2, 2017.</ref> Two albums followed: ''A Lesson to Be Learned'' released in 1992, which peaked at #60 on the ''Billboard'' magazine [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, and ''Ruthless by Law'' released in 1994, which surpassed their debut by making it to #23, and also made [[The Billboard 200]] at #197.<ref name=billboard/> In 1995, they produced a solo record for group member Hitman (Ricky Herd) called ''Solo Creep''.

Their impressive sales for regional indie releases attracted interest from [[Atlantic Records]] subsidiary [[Big Beat Records (Atlantic Records subsidiary)|Big Beat]], which signed the group. Before they could deliver an album, Mr. Cee was shot nine times and killed near his home on [[New Year's Day]] in 1996, on Harbor Road.  This murder set off a wave of retaliation-killings in this section of the city. Black C also lost an eye in 1988 during the San Francisco gang wars in a drive-by shooting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sward|first=Susan|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/12/16/MN232399.DTL|title=In Bayview-Hunters Point, a series of unsolved homicides has devastated one of S.F.'s most close-knit communities|date=December 16, 2001|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref>

Black C and Hitman filled the void created by Mr. Cee's absence with various producers, including [[Rick Rock]] and [[MC Eiht]], and released ''An Eye for an Eye'' in 1997. Musician and Co-producer Shannon Lacy whom also wrote and performed the instrumentation on "Strictly this game". The album peaked at #70 on The ''Billboard'' 200 chart and got as high as #14 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.<ref name=billboard/>

Another Hitman solo record was released in 1999 and in 2000, RBL Posse released a double album—''Bootlegs and Bay Shit: The Resume''.  In May 2001, Hitman was shot in the leg in a gang related shooting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Van Derbeken|first=Jaxon|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/02/MNW214848.DTL|title=Escalating violence between S.F. gangs / Big Block leader's half-brother killed|date=May 2, 2001|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Corporation|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref>

2001's ''Hostile Takeover'' would prove to be the group's last album when, on February 3, 2003, Hitman was shot in the head and killed while driving in the [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco|Hunters Point]] section of San Francisco.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); No by-line-->|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/02/03/BA104855.DTL|title=Man found fatally shot in car in Bayview district|date=February 3, 2003|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Corporation|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}</ref>
