==History==
Shapiro and Resnick are originally from New York and New Jersey, respectively, but began to perform for the first time in Boston in 2007.  The two currently reside in Los Angeles, after recently moving from New York. Timeflies includes elements of hip-hop, pop, electro, R&B, and rap in their music.

Attending [[Tufts University]], the pair met in fall 2007 at a college party where Shapiro [[freestyle rap|freestyled]] over Resnick's [[beat boxing]]. Resnick later invited Shapiro to be the singer for The Ride, a funk band he was part of.  "The Ride" dissolved after some members graduated but Resnick and Shapiro started recording together in the spring semester of their senior year.  Eventually calling themselves Timeflies, the duo posted songs to an increasingly popular YouTube account in which Shapiro did vocals over beats Resnick produced. The group's exposure increased when Shapiro's housemate - now the general manager of Timeflies - Jared Glick sent their song "Fade" to various music blogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://923now.cbslocal.com/2013/05/08/timeflies-talks-past-present-future-in-studio-with-toro/ |accessdate=December 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122053535/http://923now.cbslocal.com/2013/05/08/timeflies-talks-past-present-future-in-studio-with-toro/ |archivedate=November 22, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/473992/timeflies-discuss-one-night-ep-unlikely-rise-to-success |title=Timeflies Discuss 'One Night' EP & Unlikely Rise To Success |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/timeflies-an-electro-hip-hop-dub-something-duo-proves-to-be-more-than-your-average-college-band-1.2472505#.UqOhvXmA21t |accessdate=December 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012092609/http://www.tuftsdaily.com/timeflies-an-electro-hip-hop-dub-something-duo-proves-to-be-more-than-your-average-college-band-1.2472505 |archivedate=October 12, 2013 }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131213041124/http://www.tuftsdaily.com/arts/weekender-timeflies-from-tufts-to-the-today-show-1.2828601?pagereq=1 ]</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Rob Resnick had an early start in production after building a Pro Tools studio in his basement for his high school bands, Inevitable and After Tonight. At Tufts, Resnick majored in music and philosophy. During sophomore year, he began using audio production software such as [[Reason (software)|Reason]], [[Digital Performer]] and [[Ableton Live]]. During this time, Resnick was a DJ regularly, and played drums for The Ride, a blues/funk/hip-hop band noted for their ability to cross musical genres. Resnick also worked at Cedar Lake Camp as music director which gave him a good amount of music production experience. He cites [[Porter Robinson]], [[Benny Blanco]], [[Pretty Lights]], and [[JR Rotem]] as major influences.<ref name=timefliesAbout/>

Cal Shapiro has been singing and freestyling since he was a teenager, earning his first public "stripes" beating defending champion Puge in a freestyle battle at Hampshire. He later earned his college degree at Tufts University, majoring in music and entrepreneurship. In his sophomore year, upon joining The Ride, Shapiro fell in love with performing. He later teamed up with The Ride's drummer, Rob Resnick, to form Timeflies. Shapiro's musical influences include [[Robert Johnson]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Muddy Waters]], and his favorite, [[Big L]]. He has become well known for his love for scotch, hence their first album name, ''The Scotch Tape''.
