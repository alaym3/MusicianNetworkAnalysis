==Career==
===1977–1980===
Vanity began entering local beauty pageants before moving to [[Toronto]], where she modeled. She won the Miss Niagara Hospitality title in 1977<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/opinion-story/8185857-denise-matthews-the-niagara-falls-beauty-queen-who-became-vanity/ |work=Niagara Falls Review |title=Denise Matthews: The Niagara Falls beauty queen who became Vanity |date=February 16, 2016}}</ref> and went on to compete for Miss Canada in 1978. At age 17, she moved to [[New York City]] to further her career. She signed with [[Zoli Model Agency]]. However, because she was short in stature, her modeling career was limited to commercials and photoshoots and excluded runway work. Vanity appeared in commercials for Pearl Drops toothpaste, before completing a modeling stint in Japan.

===1980–1992===
In 1980, she had a small role in the horror movie ''[[Terror Train]],'' which was filmed in Montreal a year earlier.  She then went to Toronto to film the lead role in the [[B-movie]] ''[[Tanya's Island]].'' At the time of both film roles, she was billed as D. D. Winters. She met [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] when she was [[Rick James]]' date at the [[American Music Awards]].<ref name="people1">{{cite web |last=Buchalter |first=Gail |date=October 15, 1984 |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088910,00.html |title=Her Romance with Prince Hit the Rocks, but Vanity's Singing Career Is Going Grrr-Eat |work=People.com |access-date=August 18, 2010}}</ref> Prince renamed her Vanity, as he considered her to be the female form of himself. After learning that Vanity could sing, Prince asked her to become the lead singer of the girl group [[Vanity 6]].<ref name="people1"/> "Prince created the whole Vanity Six image. It bothered me at the time. I lied and said it was the image I wanted. I did it because he told me I had to do it. If I didn’t do it, I wouldn’t get paid. I got into it. I wanted the old Diana Ross image," she said.<ref name=":0" /> Vanity 6 recorded one album, and had some success internationally with the single "[[Nasty Girl (Vanity 6 song)|Nasty Girl]]".  Vanity then left the group (and Prince's organization), and signed with [[Motown Records]] as a solo artist in 1984. She released two albums for Motown in the mid-1980s, and had mild success on the US pop and R&B charts with a number of singles.

After her music career started, as Vanity she starred in a number of movies, including ''[[The Last Dragon]]'' (1985), which featured her underground hit "7th Heaven." In 1986, she starred in ''[[Never Too Young to Die]]'' opposite [[John Stamos]]. She went on to appear in ''[[52 Pick-Up]]'' and 1988's ''[[Action Jackson (1988 film)|Action Jackson]]'', her highest profile role, in which she starred opposite [[Carl Weathers]], [[Craig T. Nelson]], and [[Sharon Stone]]. From the mid–1980s to the early–1990s, Vanity guest–starred on numerous TV shows. She played a villain who tortured [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]]'s character in the 1990 TV movie ''Memories of Murder'', guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Miami Vice]]''{{'}}s third season, and in 1992 appeared in an episode of ''[[Highlander: The Series]]''. She also appeared in ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'' in the episode entitled "Mesmer's Bauble". She appeared nude in ''[[Playboy]]'' in April 1988.

==Personal life==
In 1980, Matthews attended the [[American Music Awards]] with [[Rick James]] where she met [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. Matthews and Prince then began dating shortly after.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/20/the-sexy-holy-saga-of-vanity-prince-s-muse-who-found-god|title=The Sexy, Holy Saga of Vanity: Prince's Muse Who Found God|last=Williams|first=Stereo|date=February 20, 2016|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=November 4, 2017}}</ref> Vanity was linked romantically to [[Adam Ant]] (who wrote the track "Vanity" about her on his ''[[Strip (Adam Ant album)|Strip]]'' album) and [[Billy Idol]].<ref name=jet>{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Margena A. |date=November 26, 2007|title=Vanity|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=112|issue=21|page=49|issn=0021-5996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1joDAAAAMBAJ&q=vanity+anthony+smith&pg=PA49}}</ref> On [[The Late Show (1986 talk show)|''The Late Show'']] in 1987, Matthews announced that she and [[Mötley Crüe]] bassist [[Nikki Sixx]] were engaged. She joked to host [[Arsenio Hall]] that she would become Vanity 6 (Sixx) again. They never married. In his memoir, ''[[The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]'', Nikki Sixx details their volatile relationship and drug use. Matthews was addicted to [[crack cocaine]] at the time.

On her first anniversary of sobriety, Matthews married football player [[Anthony Smith (defensive end)|Anthony Smith]] of the [[Oakland Raiders]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite journal|date=April 17, 1995|title=Vanity Weds Pro Football Star Anthony Smith After Monthlong Courtship|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=87|issue=23|page=14|issn=0021-5996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czkDAAAAMBAJ&q=vanity+anthony+smith&pg=PA14}}</ref> Matthews was working as an evangelist in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] when she read about Smith's philanthropic activities in Los Angeles. "The Lord told me that I would go down to L.A. and minister him," she told [[Ebony (magazine)|''Ebony'']]. Three days after they met she proposed to him. They married after a one-month whirlwind romance. The wedding took place at Smith's home in [[Playa del Rey, Los Angeles|Playa del Rey]]. Smith revealed that they often argued because of her kind nature. Matthews had a habit of inviting homeless people into their home for food and offering them showers, she would also give out her number.<ref name=Ebony>{{Cite journal|date=June 1995|title=At Home With Vanity And Her New Husband|journal=Ebony|volume= 50| issue =  8|pages=54–58}}</ref> Smith was volatile and the marriage ended in 1996.

===Conversion to Christianity===
In early 1992, Vanity became a born-again Christian, and stated in several interviews that she would not take any more sexualized roles. Her roles in 1992's ''[[Lady Boss#Miniseries|Lady Boss]]'' and ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' had Matthews play different kinds of characters. Simultaneously, she renounced her stage name Vanity and reverted to Denise once again. She traveled extensively throughout the South with her friend/agent Benjamin Jimerson-Phillips, giving her testimony of conversion to Jesus Christ. In 1994, Matthews was hospitalized for three months for near-fatal [[kidney failure]] from a drug overdose. She recalled later that after being rushed to the hospital, doctors said she had three days to live while on life support. Her friend Benjamin Jimerson-Phillips was by her hospital bedside. Later it was revealed, he was the one who notified Prince by Western Union Telegram that she had been hospitalized. She explained that [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|Jesus appeared to her]] at this time and spoke to her, saying that if she promised to abandon her Vanity persona, he would save her. Upon her recovery, she fully ended her performing career and devoted herself to being a born-again Christian. In 1995, she said, "When I came to the Lord Jesus Christ, I threw out about 1,000 tapes of mine— every interview, every tape, every video, everything."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rettenmund|first=Matthew |title=Totally Awesome 80s: A Lexicon Of the Music, Videos, Movies, TV shows, Stars, and Trends Of That Decadent Decade|publisher=Macmillan|year=1996|page=57|isbn=0-312-14436-9}}</ref> Jimerson-Phillips stated: "I was there at her apartment at The Grand in Sherman Oaks, when she just started dumping things down the incinerator. I grabbed some of the items including a painting titled Tailspin, by famed artist [[Olivia_De_Berardinis|Olivia]]; a cassette hand painted by Prince of unreleased music; and an assortment of other items I didn’t want to see go into the trash. I even had to go down to the office and ask them to retrieve her gold album she had thrown away." She stated that she had chosen not to receive any further revenue from her work as Vanity, and cut off all ties with Hollywood and her former life in show business.<ref name="denisematthews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveoldschoolmusic.com/wow-smoking-crack-cocaine-vanity-says-jesus-came-said/|access-date=February 18, 2016|date=October 5, 2014|work=I Love Old School Music|title=Wow! After Smoking Crack Cocaine, Vanity Says Jesus Came To Her And Said...}}</ref> After a [[kidney transplant]] in 1997, she dedicated the rest of her life full-time to Christ. She made speaking engagements at churches across the United States and worldwide. In 2010, she released her autobiography, ''Blame It On Vanity: Hollywood, Hell and Heaven'', in which she thanks Jimerson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blameitonvanity.com/index3.php|access-date=August 18, 2010|date=February 15, 2016|work=Blame It On Vanity|title=Former Prince Protege', Denise "Vanity" Matthews of Vanity 6, Dies At 57}}</ref>
