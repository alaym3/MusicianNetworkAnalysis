'''Unsane''' is an American [[noise rock]] trio that was formed in [[New York City]] in 1988. Its music touches on elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[heavy metal music|metal]]. The writer Patrick Kennedy wrote, "While developing the blueprint for noise-metal bands to follow, Unsane cut a remarkable swath through [[underground music]], inspiring a devoted, [[cult following|cult-like following]] around the world."<ref name="allmusic bio"/>

==Biography==
In 1988, the singer/guitarist Chris Spencer, bass guitarist Pete Shore and drummer Charlie Ondras were students at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] when they formed Lawn-Chair-Blisters<ref name="matador bio"/> before changing the name to Unsane. The band signed to Circuit Records and recorded tracks with [[Wharton Tiers]] for what was supposed to be their first album ''Improvised Munitions'', but the label did not release it.<ref name="matador bio"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Joseph |first=Daniel |url=http://www.spacecityrock.com/features/unsane1.shtml |title=Life at the Bottom - Unsane on Noise, Growing Up, and Surviving NYC in the '80s |publisher=Space City Rock |access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

Unsane became part of the scene of loud, noisy, like-minded rock groups in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] in the early 1990s. They often played gigs with bands like [[Pussy Galore (band)|Pussy Galore]], [[Cop Shoot Cop]], [[Surgery (band)|Surgery]], [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]] and the Reverb Motherfuckers. Members of Unsane also played in other bands such as [[Boss Hog]] and the [[Action Swingers]].

The band's first album, ''[[Unsane (album)|Unsane]]'', was released in 1991,<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=464}}</ref> and was known for its harsh music and gruesome cover art with a photo of a decapitated man on a New York subway track wearing a [[Members Only (fashion brand)|Members Only]] jacket. The band obtained this photograph from a friend who was working at the time with the police department, which was investigating the scene of the accident.<ref name="Indie Wire">{{cite web|last1=Jagernauth|first1=Kevin (2015-10-29)|title=Exclusive: Have A Religious Experience With Unsane In Clip From Amphetamine Reptile Doc 'The Color Of Noise'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/exclusive-have-a-religious-experience-with-unsane-in-clip-from-amphetamine-reptile-doc-the-color-of-noise-109479/|website=Indiewire.com|access-date=2017-03-12}}</ref>

In 1992, Ondras died of a [[heroin]] [[drug overdose|overdose]] and was replaced by [[Vincent Signorelli]] (formerly of [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]] and [[Swans (band)|Swans]]).<ref name="LarkinHR"/> In 1994, Shore left the band for unknown reasons and was replaced by Dave Curran.

The band toured heavily, and released ''[[Total Destruction]]'' in 1993 on [[Matador Records]]/[[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Their third album, ''[[Scattered, Smothered & Covered]]'', was issued by [[Amphetamine Reptile]] in 1995.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The [[music video]] for the song "Scrape", made for a mere $200, had significant play on [[MTV]]. The video alternates between lo-fi rehearsal footage of Unsane and a series of serious [[skateboarding]] wipeouts.

The band continued touring heavily (including a spell opening for [[Slayer]]). Their next album, ''[[Occupational Hazard]]'', was released by [[Relapse Records]] in 1998. Later that same year, seemingly fulfilling of the album's title, Spencer was attacked by four people after playing a concert in [[Vienna, Austria]].<ref name="lowcut interview"/> He was hospitalized with internal bleeding and underwent major surgery. As a result of his injury, and having toured over ten months of the year, the band decided to take a long break in 2000.

Unsane regrouped in 2003 and released the CD/DVD compilation ''[[Lambhouse: The Collection 1991-1998]]'' the same year. This was followed by their fifth album, ''[[Blood Run (album)|Blood Run]]'', in 2005.  [[Ipecac Recordings|Ipecac]] released the band's sixth studio album, ''[[Visqueen (album)|Visqueen]]'', in 2007.

Their song "Committed" was used in the Activision/Neversoft video game ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater]]''. Another Activision title, ''[[True Crime: New York City]]'', uses the song "D Train".

Unsane released their seventh album ''[[Wreck (album)|Wreck]]'' on March 20, 2012, and toured with [[Melvins]] in April and May that year.

Unsane released their eighth studio album ''[[Sterilize (album)|Sterilize]]'' on September 29, 2017.

In 2019, Spencer announced the formation of a new band, [[Human Impact]], with ex-Swans members Phil Puleo and Chris Pravdica. Spencer subsequently announced his departure from Unsane in August 2019, first in an interview about Human Impact with the Italian-language music zine ''Equilibrio Precario'', and then in English in a comment on a Facebook post of the same article.

On 27th August 2021, Chris Spencer announced the formation of a new lineup of Unsane via the band's Instagram page, alongside new members Cooper and [[Jon Syverson]], with the specific focus on performing the band's early material.

==Activities outside the band==
During the band's break between 2000 and 2003, Spencer moved to [[California]] where he formed a new band with Curran called [[The Cutthroats 9]] and released an album on [[Man's Ruin Records]]. Curran formed J.J. Paradise Players Club and Signorelli opened a tattoo shop in Middle Village Queens.

Signorelli later formed [[A Storm of Light]] with Josh Graham ([[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], ex-[[Red Sparowes]], [[Battle of Mice]], Blood and Time) on guitar and vocals, Domenic Seita (ex-Tombs and Asea) on bass guitar, and Pete Angevine (Satanized) on additional drums and percussion. A Storm of Light spent most of the spring touring with Neurosis and they released their first album in 2008.

In 2008, Spencer formed the band Celan with Ari Benjamin Meyers (Redux Orchestra), Niko Wenner ([[Oxbow (band)|Oxbow]]), Roeder and Xavi (both ex-flu-ID) and, in 2009, they released the well-reviewed album ''Halo'' on the Berlin label Exile on Mainstream Records and toured Europe. Spencer now plays in [[noise rock]] band, Human Impact.
