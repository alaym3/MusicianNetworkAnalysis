==Personal life==
Aurora did not originally expect to perform music professionally, preferring to keep her music private: "I never really wanted to sing, or to be on the stage at all," she said. "I just wanted to write, maybe become a doctor or a physicist or something of that kind."<ref>{{Citation|title=Finding What You Didn't Expect|work=Taking Care of Time|pages=65–66|publisher=Michigan State University Press|isbn=9781609175566|doi=10.14321/j.ctt1xhr7j7.43|year=2018}}</ref> When she was 16, Aurora performed a "really long and boring song about world peace" at her high school's leaving ceremony, and a classmate put the video online. Around the same time, a friend uploaded a track Aurora had recorded as a Christmas gift for her parents to [[SoundCloud]].<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/64ymyb/aurora-interview-all-my-demons-greeting-me-as-a-friend|title=Aurora: "Without Darkness the World Would Be Boring and Life Would Be Very Flat"|last=Levine|first=Nick|date=11 March 2016|website=Vice|access-date=18 October 2019}}</ref> These two songs were discovered by a representative of Made Management, a Norwegian management company, who invited Aurora to visit their office for a meeting in early 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rustad|first=Eric|date=17 January 2015|title=Aurora Talks Career, New EP and Dragons|url=http://www.tapsongz.com/aurora-interview.html|access-date=18 October 2019|website=TapSongz.com}}</ref><ref name="auto4">{{Cite web|date=10 November 2016|title=Top shows this week: Aurora and more|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/11/10/top-shows-week-aurora-and-more/93260850/|access-date=18 October 2019|website=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel}}</ref> "At first I thought no," she recalls. "But then my mum said I should think about the idea of sharing my music with the world because maybe there's someone out there who desperately needs it.

"I don’t think I was born to be an entertainer, I used to really be afraid of playing live on-stage. Obviously it’s terrifying!
