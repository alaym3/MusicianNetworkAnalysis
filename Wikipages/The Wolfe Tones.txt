'''The Wolfe Tones''' are an [[Irish rebel music]] band that incorporate [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional music]] in their songs. Formed in 1963, they take their name from [[Wolfe Tone|Theobald Wolfe Tone]], one of the leaders of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], with the double meaning of a [[wolf tone]] – a spurious sound that can affect instruments of the violin family.

==History==
===1963–1964: Formation===
The origins of the group date back to August 1963, where three neighbouring children from the Dublin suburb of [[Inchicore]], [[Brian Warfield]], Noel Nagle, and Liam Courtney, had been musical friends from childhood. In August 1964 Brian's brother [[Derek Warfield]] joined the band, and in November 1964 Tommy Byrne replaced Courtney, creating the band's most recognizable line-up, which would last for nearly 37 years until January 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irish-folk-songs.com/the-wolfe-tones-story.html|title=The Wolfe Tones story|website=Irish folk songs}}</ref>

===1964–2001===
In 1989, a contract was signed by Derek Warfield, signing rights to an American distributor, [[Shanachie Records]]. The contents of this contract were apparently misrepresented to the other members of the band, resulting in a clause that prevented them from recording any new material. Unable to reverse this agreement, they continued to tour, albeit without any new material.

In 1995, Derek Warfield released a solo studio album entitled ''Legacy'' as he was still eligible to record under his own name. With Derek on vocals and mandolin, the music on this album was performed by a new band, although he was still in fact touring with the Wolfe Tones. Derek's solo releases continued annually until 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Derek Warfield |url=http://www.theyoungwolfetones.com/?page_id=21 |website=Derek Warfield The Young Wolfe Tones |publisher=The Young Wolfe Tones |access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>

In 2001, after a show played in Limerick, Derek Warfield departed the band to concentrate on his own career. Calling themselves "Brian Warfield, Tommy Byrne and Noel Nagle, formerly of the Wolfe Tones" the three would later go on to release "You'll Never Beat the Irish" and the more recent album "Child of Destiny".

===2001–present===
The Wolfe Tones continue to tour, but as a 3-piece band comprising Brian Warfield, Noel Nagle and Tommy Byrne.<ref>{{cite web |author=Rory Warfield |url=http://www.wolfetonesofficialsite.com |title=Wolfetonesofficialsite.com |publisher=Wolfetonesofficialsite.com |access-date=20 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829200733/http://www.wolfetonesofficialsite.com/ |archive-date=29 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The Wolfe Tones celebrated their 45th Anniversary with a special event at the [[Waterfront Hall]], [[Belfast]], on 26 October 2008, which was also filmed for a documentary. In 2014 they celebrated their 50th anniversary by performing at the Citywest Hotel and Conference Centre in a series of Easter weekend concerts.

In 2018, they headlined the [[Féile an Phobail]] in West Belfast to a sell-out audience of over 12,000 people and were inducted into the [[Barrowlands]] hall of fame for their contribution to music. At the end of each December, the Wolfe Tones perform three concerts at Dublin's Citywest Hotel.

== Notable works ==
The song "Irish Eyes" was written by Brian Warfield as a [[paean]] for his mother Kathleen who died of cancer the year previous to its release. A song about emigration to London entitled "My Heart is in Ireland"  became a number 2 hit for the band. The song "Celtic Symphony" was written by Warfield in 1987 for the centennial of [[Celtic Football Club]]. Other famous songs written by the group include "Joe McDonnell", a song about the life and death of the [[Provisional IRA]] member [[Joe McDonnell (hunger striker)|Joe McDonnell]] who was the fifth person to die on the [[1981 Hunger Strike]]; and "The Protestant Men", a song about some of the notable [[Protestant Irish nationalists]]. The band also covered "The Streets of New York" which Liam Reilly from [[Bagatelle (band)|Bagatelle]] wrote, inspired by stories of the Tones' friendship with NYPD. Warfield also penned his rendition of "[[The Helicopter Song]]" which was written by Sean (Jobby) Mc Ginley. "[[The Helicopter Song]]" stands as the fastest selling single of all time in Ireland, shooting straight to number one in 1974 as a result of the escape from Mountjoy Jail.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Footballer [[James McClean]] (of [[Sunderland FC|Sunderland]] at the time) attracted criticism when he tweeted that he listened to their song "[[The Broad Black Brimmer]]" before a match, a song in which a son learns of how his father was killed in fighting for the IRA. He was told by club manager [[Martin O'Neill]] to refrain from using Twitter.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=27 February 2013 |title=James McClean closes Twitter account after Wolfe Tones song row |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21600688 |publisher=BBC News |location=Northern Ireland |access-date=22 April 2017 }}</ref>

The band's 1982 hit "[[Admiral William Brown]]" pays homage to the Irish-born Argentine naval hero [[William Brown (admiral)|William Brown]].

In January 2020, the band's version of [[Come Out Ye Black and Tans]] reached No. 1 on the Ireland and UK [[iTunes]] charts, following criticism of the Irish government's planned commemoration of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]], as part of its '[[Irish revolutionary period#Commemoration|Decade of Commemoration]]'.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/come-out-ye-black-and-tans-is-number-1-in-irish-and-uk-itunes-charts-1.4135091 |title=Come Out Ye Black And Tans is number 1 in Irish and UK iTunes charts | newspaper= [[The Irish Times]] |date=10 January 2020  |access-date=10 January 2020}}</ref> As a result of this, on 10 January, the song entered the [[Irish Singles Chart]] at No. 33<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/justin-bieber-scores-the-highest-new-entry-on-the-official-irish-singles-chart-with-yummy__28200/ |title=Justin Bieber scores the highest new entry on the Official Irish Singles Chart with Yummy|website= [[Official Charts Company]] |date=10 January 2020 |access-date=10 January 2020}}</ref> and also debuted at No. 1 in the [[Scottish Singles and Albums Charts|Scottish Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/scottish-singles-chart/|title=Official Scottish Singles Sales Chart Top 100|website= [[Official Charts Company]] |date=10 January 2020 |access-date=10 January 2020}}</ref>
