'''Ioanna''' "'''Nana'''" '''Mouskouri''' ({{lang-el|Ιωάννα "Νάνα" Μούσχουρη}} {{IPA-el|i.oˈana ˈnana ˈmusxuri|}}; born 13 October 1934) is a Greek singer. Over the span of her career, she has released over 200 albums in at least twelve languages, including [[Greek language|Greek]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Corsican language|Corsican]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nana-mouskouri-mn0000368451/discography|title=Nana Mouskouri {{!}} Album Discography {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>

Mouskouri became well known throughout Europe for the song "The White Rose of Athens", recorded first in German as "Weiße Rosen aus Athen" as an adaptation of her Greek song "{{lang|el|Σαν σφυρίξεις τρείς φορές}}" (''San sfyríxeis tris forés'', "When you whistle three times"). It became her first record to sell over one million copies.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Wendland Nearing One Million Mark|last=Keeb|first=Brigitte|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LhYEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22One+Million%22+%22Nana+Mouskouri%22|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=21 April 1962|access-date=22 December 2017}}</ref>

Later in 1963, she represented [[Luxembourg]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[À force de prier]]". Her friendship with the composer [[Michel Legrand]] led to the recording by Mouskouri of the theme song of the Oscar-nominated film ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]''. From 1968 to 1976, she hosted her own TV show produced by [[BBC]], ''Presenting Nana Mouskouri''. Her popularity as a multilingual television personality and distinctive image, owing to the then unusual signature black-rimmed glasses, turned Mouskouri into an international star.

"[[Je chante avec toi Liberté]]", recorded in 1981, is perhaps her biggest hit to date, performed in at least five languages<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanamouskouri.de/songforl.htm |title=Song For Liberty |website=Nanamouskouri.de |access-date=2013-08-20}}</ref> – French,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freedb.org/freedb/folk/7b097f0c |title=Data: Nana Mouskouri / Je Chante Avec Toi Liberté |website=Freedb.org}}</ref> English as "Song for Liberty",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freedb.org/freedb/misc/9a0a060c |title=Data: Nana Mouskouri / Song for Liberty |website=Freedb.org}}</ref> German as "Lied der Freiheit",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freedb.org/freedb/misc/1c117313 |title=Data: Nana Mouskouri / Ich hab gelacht ich hab geweint - CD 2 |website=Freedb.org}}</ref> Spanish as "Libertad"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freedb.org/freedb/classical/95089d0a |title=Data: Nana Mouskouri / Libertad |website=Freedb.org}}</ref> and Portuguese as "Liberdade".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Nana-Mouskouri-Liberdade/release/3550870 |title=Nana Mouskouri – Liberdade (Vinyl, LP) |website=Discogs.com |access-date=2013-08-20}}</ref> "[[Only Love (Nana Mouskouri song)|Only Love]]", a song recorded in 1985 as the theme song of TV series ''[[Mistral's Daughter]]'', gained worldwide popularity along with its other versions in French (as "L'Amour en Héritage"), Italian (as "Come un'eredità"), Spanish (as "La dicha del amor"), and German (as "Aber die Liebe bleibt"). It became her only UK hit single when it reached number two in February 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/22957/nana-mouskouri/|title=NANA MOUSKOURI {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/276974/nana-mouskouri/biography|title=Nana Mouskouri|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

Mouskouri became a spokesperson for [[UNICEF]] in 1993 and was elected to the [[European Parliament]] as a Greek deputy from 1994 to 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/advocates/bios2.htm|title=Messengers of Peace- Biographies page 2|website=Un.org|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/2183/NANA_MOUSKOURI_home.html|title=Nana MOUSKOURI {{!}} History of parliamentary service {{!}} MEPs {{!}} European Parliament|website=Europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>

In 2015 she was awarded the [[Echo Music Prize]] for Outstanding achievements by the German music association Deutsche Phono-Akademie.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.daserste.de/noframe/unterhaltung/musik/echo-2015/preistraeger/lebenswerk-nana-mouskouri-100.html|title=Nana Mouskouri wird mit dem ECHO für ihr Lebenswerk ausgezeichnet {{!}} Echo 2015|work=Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen (ARD)|access-date=2018-03-19|language=de-DE}}</ref>

==Early years==
Nana Mouskouri's family lived in [[Chania, Crete]], where her father, Constantine, worked as a film projectionist in a local cinema; her mother, Alice, worked in the same cinema as an [[Usher (visitor assistant)|usherette]]. When Mouskouri was three, her family moved to [[Athens]].

Mouskouri's family sent her and her older sister Eugenía (Jenny) to the [[Athens Conservatoire]]. Although Mouskouri had displayed exceptional musical talent from age six, Jenny initially appeared to be the more gifted sibling. Financially unable to support both girls' studies, the parents asked their tutor which one should continue.  The sister conceded that Jenny had the better voice, but Nana was the one with the true inner need to sing.  Mouskouri has said that a medical examination revealed she only has one functioning [[vocal cord]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/06/nana-mouskouri-greece-forgo-pension |title=There is a sense of revolt. I feel it too |last=Edemariam |first=Aida  |date=5 March 2010 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=11 March 2017}}</ref> and this could well account for her remarkable singing voice (in her younger years ranging from a husky, dark [[alto]], which she later dropped, to a ringing [[coloratura]] [[Mezzo-soprano|mezzo]]), as opposed to her breathy, raspy speaking voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanamouskouri.info/pdfs/Nz_Articles/stuff1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820033739/http://www.nanamouskouri.info/pdfs/Nz_Articles/stuff1.pdf|archive-date=2006-08-20|date=August 20, 2006}}</ref>

Mouskouri's early childhood was marked by the German [[Battle of Greece|Nazi occupation of Greece]]. Her father became part of the anti-Nazi resistance movement in Athens. Mouskouri began singing lessons at age 12. As a child, she listened to radio broadcasts of singers including [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Billie Holiday]], and [[Édith Piaf]].

In 1950, she was accepted at the Conservatoire. She studied classical music with an emphasis on singing [[opera]]. After eight years at the Conservatoire, Mouskouri was encouraged by her friends to experiment with [[jazz]] music. She began singing with her friends' jazz group at night. However, when Mouskouri's Conservatory professor found out about Mouskouri's involvement with a genre of music that was not in keeping with her classical studies, he prevented her from sitting for her end-of-year exams.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davis |first1=Barry |title=Nana Mouskouri – forever young at 84 |url=https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/nana-mouskouri-forever-young-at-84-570701 |access-date=10 April 2021 |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=30 October 2018}}</ref> During an episode of "Joanna Lumley's Greek Odyssey", shown on the UK ITV channel in the autumn of 2011, Mouskouri told the actress [[Joanna Lumley]] how she had been scheduled to sing at the amphitheatre at Epidauros with other students of the Conservatoire, when upon arrival at the amphitheatre word came through from the Conservatoire in Athens that she had just been barred from participating in the performance there owing to 
her involvement in light music. Mouskouri subsequently left the Conservatoire and began performing at the Zaki club in Athens.

She began singing jazz in nightclubs with a bias towards Ella Fitzgerald repertoire. In 1957, she recorded her first song, "Fascination", in both Greek and English for Odeon/EMI Greece. By 1958 while still performing at the Zaki, she met Greek composer [[Manos Hadjidakis]]. Hadjidakis was impressed by Nana's voice and offered to write songs for her. In 1959 Mouskouri performed Hadjidakis' "Κάπου υπάρχει η αγάπη μου" (''Kápou ipárchi i agápi mou'', "Somewhere my love exists"; co-written with poet [[Nikos Gatsos]]) at the inaugural [[Greek Song Festival]]. The song won first prize, and Mouskouri began to be noticed.

At the 1960 Greek Song Festival, she performed two more Hadjidakis compositions, "Τιμωρία" (''Timōría'', "Punishment") and "Κυπαρισσάκι" (''Kyparissáki'', "Little cypress"). Both these songs tied for first prize. Mouskouri performed [[Kostas Yannidis]]' composition, "Ξύπνα αγάπη μου" (''Xýpna agápi mou'', "Wake up, my love"), at the [[Mediterranean Song Festival]], held in [[Barcelona]] that year. The song won first prize, and she went on to sign a recording contract with [[Paris]]-based [[Philips Records|Philips-Fontana]].

In 1961, Mouskouri performed the soundtrack of a [[West Germany|German]] documentary about Greece. This resulted in the German-language single ''Weiße Rosen aus Athen'' ("White Roses from Athens"). The song was originally adapted by Hadjidakis from a folk melody. It became a success, selling over a million copies in Germany. The song was later translated into several  languages and it went on to become one of Mouskouri's signature tunes.

==Family life==
Mouskouri has been married twice: firstly at 25, to Yorgos (George) Petsilas,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeksongs-greekmusic.com/nana-mouskouri/|title=Nana Mouskouri|work=greeksongs-greekmusic.com}}</ref> a guitarist in her backing band (the trio "The Athenians") and the first man she had kissed. They had two children (Nicolas Petsilas in 1968 and Hélène (Lénou) Petsilas (singer) in 1970) but divorced when Mouskouri was 39.<ref name="guardian2010">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/06/nana-mouskouri-greece-forgo-pension|title=There is a sense of revolt. I feel it too|author=Aida Edemariam|work=the Guardian|date=6 March 2010}}</ref> Not long after that, she started a relationship with her record producer André Chapelle{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, but they did not marry then because she "didn't want to bring another father into the family" and divorce was against her conservative upbringing.<ref name="guardian2010" /> They eventually married on January 13, 2003, and live primarily in Switzerland.

==Life outside Greece==
In 1960, Mouskouri moved to Paris.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.laliberte.ch/news/dossiers/l-invite-du-lundi/nana-mouskouri-j-etais-simple-et-pas-pretentieuse-269481#.Vbz4ZNwo74Z | title=Nana Mouskouri: 'J'étais simple et pas prétentieuse' | work=La Liberté | author=Maria Malagardis | date=2015-01-05 | access-date=2015-08-01 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  She performed Luxembourg's entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963]] that year, "[[À force de prier]]". Although the song achieved only eighth place in the contest, it achieved commercial success, and helped win her the prestigious [[Grand Prix du Disque]] in France. Mouskouri soon attracted the attention of French composer [[Michel Legrand]], who composed two songs which became major French hits for her: "[[Les Parapluies de Cherbourg]]" (1964) and an arrangement of [[Katherine K. Davis]]'s "Carol of the Drum", "L'Enfant au Tambour" (1965).

In 1962, she met [[Quincy Jones]], who persuaded her to travel to [[New York City]] to record an album of American jazz titled ''The Girl from Greece Sings''. Following that she scored another hit in the [[United Kingdom]] with the song "My Colouring Book" (later included in her 1973 album ''Songs from her TV series''). In 1965, she recorded her second English-language album to be released in the United States, entitled ''Nana Sings''. American singer [[Harry Belafonte]] heard and liked the album. Belafonte brought Mouskouri on tour with him through 1966. They teamed for a duo album entitled ''An Evening With Belafonte/Mouskouri''. During this tour, Belafonte suggested that Mouskouri remove her signature black-rimmed [[glasses]] when on stage. She was so unhappy with the request that she wanted to quit the show after only two days. Finally, Belafonte relented and respected her wish to perform while wearing glasses.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/going-out-on-a-song-nana-mouskouri-sets-off-on-farewell-tour-after-40year-career-397956.html "Going out on a song: Nana Mouskouri sets off on farewell tour after 40-year career"], Jonathan Brown, ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', 26 October 2007.</ref>

On September 15, 1965, Mouskouri appeared for the first time on American television with Harry Belafonte on the ''[[Danny Kaye Show]]''. While on the show Mouskouri performed "Telalima" followed by "Σήκω χόρεψε κουκλί μου" (''Siko horepse koukli mou'') accompanied by [[Harry Belafonte]] and [[Danny Kaye]].
 
Mouskouri's 1967 French album ''Le Jour où la colombe'' raised her to super-stardom in France. This album featured many of her French songs, "Au cœur de septembre", "Adieu Angélina", "Robe bleue, robe blanche" and the French pop classic "[[Le Temps des cerises]]". Mouskouri made her first appearance at Paris' legendary [[Paris Olympia|Olympia]] concert theatre the same year, singing French pop, Greek folk, and Hadjidakis numbers.

These successes across Europe and elsewhere impressed Yvonne Littlewood, the BBC producer who had first met Mouskouri at the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest in London. Following several successful guest appearances on British TV after her Eurovision performance, the [[BBC]] then invited Mouskouri and her backing group, the Athenians, to start hosting a TV series called ''Presenting… Nana Mouskouri'' from 1968 onwards. Each episode of the series typically contained songs from her developing repertoire of Greek folk music, French chansons, classical pieces and contemporary pop, and the shows often featured [[world music]] stars of the time as guests, making it one of the first BBC TV series to do so regularly. Despite the fact that stars from mainland Europe singing in languages other than English have tended to find it difficult to break into the British market, the series proved very popular with viewers of the new [[BBC-2]] channel, and it ran until the mid-1970s. As well as performing British and American pop and folk songs in her shows, Mouskouri also welcomed the television audience, chatted to her guest stars and gave spoken introductions to her French and Greek songs in fluent English. These introductions, along with a modest stage presence and her bespectacled appearance, made her a very distinctive star, as Yvonne Littlewood later explained:

: "I suppose it was unusual to see a singer wearing glasses. She didn't look like everyone else. She didn't have blonde hair, and she was very distinctive in her appearance. […] You know, we should remember that, in those days, we didn't have all the holiday programmes, so Greek music and anything Greek wasn’t as well known to the average public as it is now. […] She would give the gist [in English] of the subject of the song before she sang it, and that was really quite unique and quite charming."<ref>Yvonne Littlewood speaking on "Legends: Nana Mouskouri" (BBC, 2008; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_US4lZ43o Youtube video]).</ref>

[[File:Nana Mouskouri toont haar platen, Bestanddeelnr 924-5530.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Nana Mouskouri receiving two gold discs for record sales in Netherlands (1971)]]

In 1969, Mouskouri released a full-length British LP, ''Over and over'', which reached number 10 and spent almost two years in the UK album charts.<ref name="tsort1">{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/ke7te3.htm |title=Album artist 344 - Nana Mouskouri |website=Tsort.info |date=2007-10-08 |access-date=2012-11-12}}</ref> This was the first of a series of English-language albums which, boosted by her TV appearances, sold extremely well in the UK and Ireland, as well as in other European countries, during the early 1970s, including ''The exquisite Nana Mouskouri'' (1969), ''Turn on the sun'' (1970), ''A place in my heart'' (1971) and ''Presenting... Nana Mouskouri'' (1973), while concerts from two of her British tours were also recorded and released as LPs: ''British Concert'' (1972) and ''Live at the Albert Hall'' (1974).

Mouskouri's international appeal encouraged the BBC to sell her programmes to television stations across the world, a fact which she acknowledged in a BBC interview in 2014:

: "This series – I mean, for about 10 years I was doing every year the series on BBC-2… and they went everywhere… in Asia… of course in the Commonwealth… but even in South America… so that I think that I owe to the BBC a lot. And to Yvonne Littlewood, really."<ref>Nana Mouskouri speaking on "BBC Breakfast" (BBC-1, 8th Sept 2014; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRRzAYOacX8 Youtube video]).</ref>

Mouskouri also hosted her own shows for French and West German broadcasters during this period. At a time when TV programmes could attract huge audiences, her popularity as a multilingual television personality turned her into a truly international star.
 
Although music series such as hers were becoming less common on British TV as the 1970s wore on, the BBC continued to engage her regularly for one-off television specials and guest appearances on other programmes until the mid-1980s, by which time she had been a regular contributor to British TV for more than 20 years. Meanwhile, during the 1970s and 1980s, she expanded her concert tour to include her new fans, not only in the United Kingdom, but also in [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]] and [[Australia]], where she met  [[Frank Hardy]], who followed her to the south of France in 1976.

Always a prolific recording artist, the 1970s saw Mouskouri record several LPs in German, including the hit albums, ''Sieben schwarze Rosen'' (1975) and ''Lieder, die die Liebe schreibt'' (1978). In  France, she continued  a series of top-selling records, such as ''Comme un soleil'' (1971), ''Une voix qui vient du cœur'' (1972), ''Vieilles chansons de France'' (1973), and ''Quand tu chantes'' (1976). Meanwhile, ''Passport,'' a compilation including her most popular songs in English, reached number 3 in the UK album charts in 1976 and won for her a gold disc.<ref name="tsort1"/>

In August 1974, while in Australia, Mouskouri was presented with a plaque representing the sale of twenty Gold Records.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1974/CB-1974-08-10.pdf|title=Cash Box Magazine|magazine=[[Cash Box magazine|Cash Box]]|via=World Radio History|page=54|date=10 August 1974|access-date=15 November 2021}}</ref>

As her fame began spreading outside her fan base in Europe, the United States, and the Commonwealth, Mouskouri was asked to  record songs for the Japanese market. Meanwhile, in 1976, a renowned Taiwanese author, Echo, heard her music and introduced it to one of her female radio DJ friends. Mouskouri's records then became popular in Taiwan, especially among high school and college students, with one of her British albums, ''Nana's book of songs'' (1974) becoming particularly popular.

==Middle years==
In 1979, Mouskouri released another English-language album named ''Roses and Sunshine''. This album consisted largely of folk and country material, and included work from sources including [[Neil Young]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[John Denver]]. It was well received in Canada, and one of the album's tracks, "Even Now" (not the same song as the 1978 [[Barry Manilow]] hit), became a staple on [[beautiful music]] radio stations in the United States. She scored a worldwide hit in 1981 with "[[Je chante avec toi Liberté]]", which was translated into several languages after its success in France. The momentum from this album also helped boost her following German album, ''Meine Lieder sind mein Leben''. In 1984, Mouskouri returned to Greece and performed to a large audience at the [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus]]; her first performance in her homeland since 1962.

In 1985, Mouskouri recorded "Only Love", the theme song to the British TV series ''[[Mistral's Daughter]]''&nbsp;– based upon the novel by [[Judith Krantz]]&nbsp;– which reached number 2 in the UK charts. The song was also a hit in its other versions: ''L'Amour en Héritage'' (French), ''Come un'eredità'' (Italian), ''La dicha del amor'' (Spanish), and ''Aber die Liebe bleibt'' (German). The German version was also recorded with an alternate set of lyrics under the title ''Der wilde Wein'' but was withdrawn in favour of ''Aber die Liebe bleibt''.

That same year, Mouskouri made a play for the Spanish-language market with the hit single ''Con Toda el Alma''. The song was a major success in [[Spain]], [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].

She released five albums in different languages in 1987, and the following year returned to her classical conservatory roots with the double LP ''The Classical Nana'' (a.k.a. ''Nana Classique''), which featured adaptations of classical songs and excerpts from opera. By the end of 1987, she had performed a series of concerts in Asia, including [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Thailand]].

==Later years==
Mouskouri's 1991 English album, ''Only Love: The Best of Nana Mouskouri'', became her best-selling release in the United States. She spent much of the 1990s touring the globe. Among her early 1990s albums were spiritual music, ''Gospel'' (1990), the Spanish-language ''Nuestras Canciones'', the multilingual, Mediterranean-themed ''Côté Sud, Côté Coeur'' (1992), ''Dix Mille Ans Encore'', ''Falling in Love Again: Great Songs From the Movies''. ''Falling in Love'' featured two duets with Harry Belafonte.

In 1993, Mouskouri recorded the album ''Hollywood''. Produced by [[Michel Legrand]] it was a collection of famous songs from films, and served not only as a tribute to the world of cinema, but also as a personal reference to childhood memories of sitting with her father in his projection room in Crete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nana-Mouskouri-Hollywood-Great-Songs-From-The-Movies/release/7425678|title=Nana Mouskouri – Hollywood (Great Songs From The Movies)|website=Discogs.com|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref>

She recorded several more albums over 1996 and 1997, including the Spanish ''Nana Latina'' (which featured duets with [[Julio Iglesias]] and [[Mercedes Sosa]]), the English-language ''Return to Love'', and the French pop classics, ''Hommages''. In 1997, she staged a high-profile ''Concert for Peace'' at the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York|Cathedral of St. John the Divine]] in New York. This concert was later released as an album, and aired as a TV special on [[PBS]] in the United States.

On 30 May 2013, Mouskouri was awarded an honorary degree by [[McGill University]], Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGill University|title=Mouskouri and Barré-Sinoussi among McGill 2013 honorary degree recipients|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/mouskouri-and-barr%C3%A9-sinoussi-%E2%80%A8among-mcgill-2013-honorary-degree-recipients-225390|access-date=22 November 2013|newspaper=Press Release|date=13 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201163724/http://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/mouskouri-and-barr%C3%A9-sinoussi-%E2%80%A8among-mcgill-2013-honorary-degree-recipients-225390|archive-date=1 February 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==UNICEF and politics==
Mouskouri was appointed a [[UNICEF]] Goodwill Ambassador in October 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.unicef.org/people/people_nana_mouskouri.html|title = UNICEF People&nbsp;— Nana Mouskouri|publisher = [[UNICEF]]|access-date = 2008-02-19}}</ref> She took over from the previous ambassador, the recently deceased actress [[Audrey Hepburn]]. Mouskouri's first U.N. mission took her to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] to draw attention to the plight of children affected by the Bosnian war. She went on to give a series of fund-raising concerts in [[Sweden]] and [[Belgium]].

She was a Member of the [[European Parliament]] for Greece through the centre-right [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party from 1994 until 1999, when she resigned from her position as an MEP. Several reasons have been given for the resignation, one being her pacifism, and another being that she felt ill-equipped for the day-to-day work of a politician.<ref>{{cite web|title = European Parliament: Your MEPs: Nana MOUSKOURI|publisher = [[European Parliament]] Correspondence with Citizens Unit|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/alphaOrder/view.do?id=2183|access-date = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

==21st century==
[[File:Nana 0001.jpg|thumb|Nana Mouskouri, waiting for an interview in 2006]]

Mouskouri lives in [[Switzerland]] with Chapelle, and, until her final performance in 2008, performed hundreds of concerts every year throughout her career.  In 2004, her French record company released a 34-[[CD]] box set of more than 600 of Mouskouri's mostly French songs.  In 2006 she made a guest appearance at that year's [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|Eurovision Song Contest]] which was held, for the first time ever, in her native Greece.

In the same year, she announced her plans to retire. From 2005 until 2008, she conducted a farewell concert tour of [[Europe]], Australia, New Zealand, [[Asia]], [[South America]], the [[United States]], and [[Canada]]. On July 23 and 24, 2008, Mouskouri gave her two final 'Farewell Concert' performances at the ancient [[Herodes Atticus Theatre]], in Athens, Greece, before a packed stadium, including Greece's Prime Minister and Athens mayor, plus the mayors of Berlin, Paris and Luxembourg, along with fans from around the world and thousands of her Athenian admirers.

In 2010, in response to the financial crisis in Greece,<ref name="greekeconomy">[http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/greece_en.htm The EU economic situation and Greece&nbsp;– ECFIN&nbsp;– European Commission], "the [European] Council decided in April 2009 that Greece was in excessive deficit"</ref> Mouskouri announced that she would forgo her pension to contribute to the country's recovery. She commented: "Everywhere I see stories about my country going bankrupt. And people are aggressive about it. It's frightening. And it's painful for me. Nobody wants their country to be treated badly. It's frustrating and very sad."<ref name="guardian2010" />

In late 2011, Mouskouri released two newly recorded CDs, the first featuring songs of the Greek Islands, recorded with other Greek singers, and the second featuring duets with French contemporaries. In late November 2011 Mouskouri sang again at a single concert, with guests, in Berlin, commemorating the 50th anniversary of her hit single "The White Rose of Athens". She then did a concert tour in Germany in 2012.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bilanz.ch/gespraech/nana-mouskouri-ich-habe-hoffnung-fuer-griechenland | title=Nana Mouskouri: 'Ich habe Hoffnung für Griechenland' | work=Bilanz | author=Stephan Lüscher and Christian Wapp | date=2012-04-01 | access-date=2015-08-01}}</ref> At age 80, she embarked on a three-year Happy Birthday Tour<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nanamouskouri.us/|title=Home|website=Nanamouskouri.us}}</ref> and in 2018 had booked a five-month Forever Young Tour through parts of Europe and North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nana-mouskouri.net/index.php?article13/nana-on-stage-2018-forever-young|title=Nana on stage 2018... forever young ! - Nana Mouskouri|website=Nana-mouskouri.net}}</ref>

In 2015 she was awarded with the [[Echo Music Prize]] for Outstanding achievements by the German music association Deutsche Phono-Akademie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daserste.de/noframe/unterhaltung/musik/echo-2015/preistraeger/lebenswerk-nana-mouskouri-100.html|title=Nana Mouskouri wird mit dem ECHO für ihr Lebenswerk ausgezeichnet - Echo 2015|website=Daserte.de}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
The British comedian [[Benny Hill]] impersonated Mouskouri on ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]''. Wearing a long dress, large glasses and long black hair, he talked and sang with a slow and quiet voice. He introduced a song with a long translation into English of all the events supposedly mentioned in the song... and then sang just a single line of "Greek".<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063869/episodes Season 3, Episode 3: Episode #3.3] IMDb.com, The Benny Hill Show (1969), Episode list.</ref>

[[Andrea Martin]] played Mouskouri in a sketch, 'The Nana Mouskouri Story', during the 1981–1982 season of ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' (later included in a DVD compilation.)

In 1976, [[Ronnie Barker]] performed a song in drag as a parody of Mouskouri in ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' as Nana Moussaka. Mouskouri was also parodied in the first episode of the 1970s New Zealand political satire ''[[A Week Of It]]''.

In 1991, British comedienne [[Victoria Wood]] mentioned Mouskouri in her original song, "The Reincarnation Song." The song was included in Wood's television special of that year, ''Victoria Wood: Sold Out''.

In the ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' episode ''O-Ed-Eleven'', Eddy's brother is shown to have a Nana Mouskouri poster in his old bedroom.

[[Karl Pilkington]] included Mouskouri as a clue in his contest 'Rockbusters', part of the radio show ''The Ricky Gervais Show'' on XFM. Broadcasting on December 31, 2005, the clue was "Me granny's taking a penalty. She better get the ball in the back of the net," initials (NM) = Nana Mouskouri (nanna must score 'ere). [[Ricky Gervais|Gervais]] described this clue as "one of his best clues ever."

In 2015, Liina Vahtrik parodied her song "Only Love" on the Estonian version of ''[[Your Face Sounds Familiar]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://melu.goodnews.ee/naosaade-sel-aastal-aarmiselt-tasavagine-liina-vahtrik-esitas-nana-mouskouri-lugu-only-love/ |title= Näosaade Sel Aastal Äärmiselt Tassavägine!
