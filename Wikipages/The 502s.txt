Their debut album has been described by PopMatters.com as “Sounds of celebration ... an ebullient blend of boisterous Americana, featuring cheery singalong vocals and bubbly trumpet lines that could get anyone off of their feet”<ref name="auto4"/> while their live show received praise for “rambunctious energy, stomping sounds.. and charismatic personalities” by Cowboys and Indians<ref name="auto7"/>

==Formation and Early History==
Influenced by bands such as The Head and the Heart and Bear's Den,<ref name="auto5"/> Ed Isola began writing songs in college with a $100 banjo and a guitar he borrowed from his roommate. After graduating and returning home, Ed recruited his cousins Jonathan Ruiz on guitar and vocals and Jacob Isola on bass.<ref name="auto2"/> 
Shortly after the band's inception in 2015, The 502s won a contest to perform at [[Okeechobee Music & Arts Festival]], alongside Mumford and Sons, The Avett Brothers, and Kendrick Lamar, beating out over 800 contest entrants. Their performance at Okeechobee took place before the band had released any recorded material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://orlandobands.wordpress.com/2016/08/13/introducing-the-502s/|title=Introducing: ‘The 502s’|date=August 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name="auto5"/>
