Guerra is one of the most internationally recognized [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] artists of recent decades. His popular style of [[Merengue music|merengue]] and Afro-Latin fusion has garnered him considerable success throughout Latin America. He is also credited for popularizing [[bachata (music)|bachata]] music on a global level and is often associated with the genre, although his distinct style of bachata features a more traditional [[bolero]] rhythm and aesthetic mixed with bossa-nova influenced melodies and harmony in some of his songs.<ref name="iaso1">{{cite web |url=http://www.iasorecords.com/Juan-Luis-Guerra.cfm |title=Juan Luis Guerra |website=Iasorecords.com |access-date=January 16, 2015}}</ref> He does not limit himself to one style of music; instead, he incorporates diverse rhythms like [[Merengue music|merengue]], bachata-fusion, balada, [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[rock and roll]], and even [[Gospel music|gospel]]. "''[[Ojalá Que Llueva Café]]''" ("Let's hope it will rain coffee") is one of his most critically acclaimed pieces.

==Career==
===Early life===
Guerra studied philosophy and literature at the [[Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo]]. He then studied guitar and music theory at El Conservatorio Nacional de Música de Santo Domingo, then attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], from which he graduated in 1982 with a diploma in jazz composition.<ref name="berklee">{{cite web|url=http://www.berklee.edu/bt/171/coverstory.html|title=Berklee Today|website=Berklee.edu|access-date=January 16, 2015}}</ref> After returning to the Dominican Republic, he released his first album, ''[[Soplando]]'' (1984), with local musicians who became known as '''Juan Luis Guerra y 440'''. The number refers to the standard tuning of [[A440 (Concert A)|A440]]. The band's name in Spanish is ''Cuatro Cuarenta'' ("Four Forty"). According to Guerra, this first album was based on jazz tunes and concepts he had learned at [[Berklee]], and it "wasn't intended to be a commercial hit." Subsequently, however, he began to write more merengues.<ref name="berklee" />

===1980s===
In 1983, after a performance in front of the Dominican entrepreneur Bienvenido Rodríguez, Juan Luis Guerra was signed to Karen Records. This marked a radical shift in Guerra's musical style toward [[Merengue music|merengue]]. In this period, he recorded two albums, [[Mudanza y Acarreo]] in 1985 and [[Mientras Más Lo Pienso...Tú]] in 1987. These works gained more recognition, and the band was nominated to attend the Festival of OTI (Organization of Iberoamerican Television) to represent the Dominican Republic.

In 1988, during the recording of the album [[Ojalá Que Llueva Café]], Guerra became the dominant vocalist of 440. This album also began his international recognition; the album's sales topped the charts in many Latin American countries.

===1990s===
In 1990, 440 released their next album, ''[[Bachata Rosa]]'', which became a major hit and earned Guerra his first Grammy award. With sales over five million, the album let Guerra keep touring Latin America, USA and Europe. It contains memorable love songs such as "Burbujas de amor" (Bubbles of Love), "Bachata Rosa", "Rosalía", "Como abeja al panal" (Like a Bee to the Honeycomb), "A pedir su mano" (Asking For Her Hand), "Carta de amor" (Love Letter), and "Estrellitas y duendes" (Little stars and elves).

Guerra attracted controversy in 1992 after he released his next album, ''[[Areíto]]'' (which is a [[Taíno people|Taíno]] word for ''song and dance''). It featured the hit single "El costo de la vida" (The Cost of Living), whose video clearly has an [[anti-capitalist]] message. Other songs included in this album protest the poor conditions in many Latin American countries, the celebration of the 'discovery' of the Americas ("1492"), and the [[double standards]] of first-world nations. "El costo de la vida" was his first number-one hit in the Hot Latin Tracks.

His next album, ''[[Fogaraté]]'' (1994) avoided such controversy. It focuses on more rural and lesser known types of Dominican music, like ''[[Perico Ripiao]]''.

Guerra's 1998 release ''[[Ni es lo mismo ni es igual]]'' (Neither The Same Nor Equal) won three Latin Grammys in 2000 for Best Merengue Performance, Best Tropical Song, and Best Engineered Album. Its hits include "[[Mi PC]]" (lit. "My PC", <small>[[Special folder|My Computer]]</small>),  "[[Palomita Blanca (song)|Palomita Blanca]]" (Little White Dove), and "[[El Niágara en Bicicleta]]" (The Niagara on Bicycle).

===2000s===
In 2004, Guerra released his first new album in six years. Entitled "Para Tí" (For you), the album's songs are mostly Christian. This album won two awards at the 2005 [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], in the categories of Gospel-Pop and Tropical-Merengue, for the hit single ''Las Avispas'' (The wasps), the first time ever that one song has won these two categories at the same time. Other hits included "Para Tí" and "Soldado" (''Soldier''). At the same time, Guerra was honored with the Latino Special Award for the [[Music Academy of Spain]] for his contributions to the music of his country and the [[Caribbean]] in the last 20 years.

In January 2006, Guerra performed at Berklee's 60th anniversary, along with other artists such as [[Paul Simon]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Michel Camilo]] and [[Chiara Civello]]. That same year, he recorded with [[Diego Torres (singer)|Diego Torres]] in "Abriendo Caminos" (Opening roads) and with [[Maná]] in "[[Bendita Tu Luz]]" (Blessed Be Your Light).

Guerra set records for the highest-grossing music tour when he opened for [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[A Bigger Bang Tour]] at their [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], Puerto Rico show in February 2006.

He was also invited by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] to sing with him at a concert at ''[[Altos de Chavón]]'', [[La Romana, Dominican Republic|La Romana]] in the Dominican Republic in 2006. At the ''Premio Lo Nuestro'' awards in 2007, he was given the honorary lifetime achievement award. He also performed the lead single of his new album, "La Llave De Mi Corazón", released in March 2007. Guerra won more than 20 awards with this CD, including 5 Latin Grammy Awards, 6 Premios Casandra awards, 4 billboard Awards, 2 lo nuestro, and one [[Grammy Award]].

On April 6, 2006, Guerra was honored as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon at the 13th annual BMI Latin Awards. Named BMI's 1995 Latin Songwriter of the Year, Guerra's songwriting has garnered 14 BMI Latin Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334752 |title=Juan Luis Guerra, Juanes Top 13th Annual BMI Latin Awards|website=Bmi.com|access-date=2010-10-11}}</ref>

In 2007,Guerra was awarded the [[Lo Nuestro Excellence Award|Excellence Award]] at the [[Premio Lo Nuestro 2007|2007 Lo Nuestro Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Juan Luis Guerra declarado "Cantautor de la Patria" |url=https://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2007/11/14/281877/juan-luis-guerra-declarado-cantautor-de-la-patria.html |access-date=February 26, 2019 |work=Emol |date=November 14, 2007 |language=es}}</ref> Guerra was honored at the Latin Grammy Awards in the same year with 5 awards, sweeping each category he was nominated in: Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Tropical Song, and Best Merengue Album.

===2010s===
On April 5, 2010, Guerra released the official video for his new single "Bachata en Fukuoka". The video was filmed in various locations in the city of Los Angeles, and was directed by acclaimed Colombian director [[Simon Brand]]. On June 8, 2010, Guerra released [[A son de Guerra]] which contains eight musical rhythms (bachata, merengue, [[bolero]], [[Mambo (music)|Mambo]], [[funk]], Rock, [[Jazz]], [[reggae]]) and includes the collaboration of [[Juanes]] among others. The album contains hits like "La Guagua", "La Calle", and "Bachata en Fukuoka". The first single from his new production, "Bachata en Fukuoka", placed in the # 1 position on the [[Hot Latin Tracks]], Tropical Songs, and Latin Pop Airplay Songs of the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. Simultaneously, the collaboration of Guerra with [[Enrique Iglesias]] on "Cuando me Enamoro" was in the #2 spot on the Rhythm Airplay Chart.

In January 2012, the video for his single "En el cielo no hay Hospital" premiered on YouTube. This song belonged to new musical production of the called "Colección Cristiana", an album that features Christian content. Later that year, he collaborated with the Spanish singer [[Miguel Bosé]] on his album [[Papitwo]], in the song "Yo creo en Ti".

On April 25, 2014, "[[Tus Besos (Juan Luis Guerra song)|Tus Besos]]" was released to the airwaves. It is a bachata song with a music video inspired by the rock and roll of the 1950s. This video was directed by his son Jean Gabriel.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fox News Latino|title=Dominican singer Juan Luis Guerra uses humor to ridicule injustices in his music|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2014/11/09/dominican-singer-juan-luis-guerra-uses-humor-to-ridicule-injustices-in-his-music/}}</ref>

In 2019 during the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] in [[Spain]], Juan Luis Guerra surpassed the record reached in 1987 by [[Celia Cruz]] by bringing together more than 400,000 people as the largest congregation of people in an open-air plaza to attend a concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eldia.es/carnaval/2019-03-10/4-Santa-Cruz-bate-record-Celia-Cruz.htm|title=Santa Cruz bate el récord de Celia Cruz|date=March 10, 2019|website=eldia.es|access-date=May 31, 2019}}</ref>

==Singing in other languages==
Guerra has recorded several songs in English, like "July 19th" on his 1994 album ''Fogaraté'', and more recently "Medicine for My Soul" and "Something Good" with Italian singer [[Chiara Civello]]. Some of his songs have verses in both English and Spanish such as "Woman del [[Callao]]", "Guavaberry", "Señorita" on his 1995 compilation album ''Grandes Exitos'' as a bonus track and more recently "''La Llave de Mi Corazón''". The album ''Areíto'' featured two songs, the cover-title song "''Areíto''" and "''Naboria daca, mayanimacaná''", which are sung in the [[Arawak language]] of the extinct Taino natives of [[Hispaniola]]. Juan Luis Guerra also recorded the album "''Bachata Rosa''" in Portuguese. He uses Japanese words in ''Bachata en Fukuoka'' (Bachata in Fukuoka), [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2010|2010 Latin Grammy]] winner for Best Tropical Song.

==As a composer for other artists==
In 1988, he made his debut as a songwriter for other artists such as fellow Dominican musician Taty Salas, for whom he wrote the music for ''De tu boca'', a song with which he participated in the now defunct OTI Festival, reaching the top 3 category. He also composed songs for Mexican artists like [[Emmanuel (singer)|Emmanuel]] (''No he podido verte'', recorded in 1990) and [[Luis Miguel]] (''Hasta que me olvides'' 1993 and ''Te necesito'' 2003). He also composed for the Puerto Rican salsa singer [[Gilberto Santa Rosa]] in 1994 (''Te Propongo'').

==Lyrical style==
Being a native Dominican, his music is heavily influenced by native Caribbean rhythms, such as merengue and bachata.

His lyrics are often charged with intentionally simple, heavily metaphorical, or popular expressions, such as "''Burbujas de Amor''" (Bubbles of Love). His lyrics also reflect in political issues, but from a deeply human perspective, that is, centering the lyrics in the human drama that social injustice generates. This is seen in "''Visa Para un Sueño''" about the broken dream of a visit to America. "''El Niágara en Bicicleta''" — a title based on the Cuban [[idiom]], "''al pasar el Niagara en bicicleta''", meaning a difficult task — describes the negligence that destroys the social health services. "''El Costo de La Vida''" describes the effects of [[globalization]] on the [[working-class]] people; "''Acompáñeme Civil''" ("Follow me Civilian") is about police and military corruption that exploits the people that they should care for.
