As ''Decibel'' writer Shawn Macomber puts it, "Code Orange dropped 'Kids' from the moniker basically on a whim—it might return; it might not—to prove nothing is static, nothing is sacred in its world."<ref name="decibel1" />}} is an American [[hardcore punk]] band that formed in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 2008. The band consists of guitarist, keyboardist and vocalist Eric Balderose, guitarist and vocalist Reba Meyers, drummer and vocalist Jami Morgan, bassist Joe Goldman, and guitarist Dominic Landolina.

The band has also released three EPs, one live album, six other albums, and twelve music videos.

The band's started as a hardcore punk band and started to shift to [[metalcore]] on the release of their debut album ''Love Is Love/Return to Dust''.
