'''Colin Vearncombe''' (26 May 1962 – 26 January 2016), known by his stage name '''Black''', was an English singer-songwriter. He emerged from the [[punk rock]] music scene and achieved mainstream pop success in the late 1980s, most notably with the 1986 single "[[Wonderful Life (Black song)|Wonderful Life]]", which was an international hit the next year.<ref name="ankeny"/><ref name="hann">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/25/black-blind-faith-review-marvellous-euro-balladry-from-colin-vearncombe|title=Black: Blind Faith review – marvellous Euro balladry from Colin Vearncombe|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London, UK|first=Michael|last=Hann|date=25 June 2015|access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref>

William Ruhlmann of [[AllMusic]] described Vearncombe as a "smoky-voiced singer/songwriter, whose sophisticated jazz-pop songs and dramatic vocal delivery place him somewhere between [[Bryan Ferry]] and [[Morrissey]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/wonderful-life-mw0000193508|title=Wonderful Life – Black &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref> Michael Hann of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described his voice as a "slightly frayed [[baritone]]".<ref name="hann"/>

==Early life==
Vearncombe was born in [[Liverpool]] and attended [[Prescot School|Prescot Grammar School]]. He then enrolled on an art foundation course at [[Liverpool John Moores University|Liverpool Polytechnic]]. He first aspired to become a musician after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] in ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]].''<ref name=Times>''The Times'' Obituary – Colin Vearncombe, 8 February 2016. p48</ref><ref name=guardian>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/26/colin-vearncombe-black|title= Colin Vearncombe obituary|work=The Guardian|date=26 January 2016|access-date=28 January 2016}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Black by Stuart Mentiply.jpg|thumb|Black in the 1990s]]
Black's first release was the single "Human Features" on Rox Records from Birkenhead in 1981.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=135–6}}</ref> At this time the band also included Dane Goulding (formerly of Blazetroopers) on bass and Greg Leyland (another school-friend) on drums, with Vearncombe calling himself Black as he did not think his own surname would be remembered. The single was followed by another independent release, "More than the Sun", in 1982. It was then that Vearncombe formed a friendship with Dave "Dix" Dickie of the Last Chant, and the two became musical collaborators and signed for [[Warner Music Group|WEA Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/colin-vearncombe-singer-known-as-black-whose-1987-song-wonderful-life-which-he-wrote-in-10-minutes-a6838276.html|title=Colin Vearncombe: Singer known as Black who wrote Wonderful Life|date=28 January 2016|website=The Independent}}</ref>

In 1982, Black played with the [[Thompson Twins]] on their 'Quick Step and Side Kick' tour and also supported [[Pete Wylie|Wah!]] on a UK tour. Black signed with WEA in 1984, and the next single was "Hey Presto", which got Vearncombe noticed outside the UK: the [[music video|video]] for the song featured on the satellite channel [[Music Box (TV)|Music Box]], and the single was also released in Australia. The second WEA single was a re-recording of "More than the Sun". After this, Black was dropped from the record label, and Vearncombe and Dix went their separate ways.<ref name="Larkin"/>

In 1985, Vearncombe wrote the [[minor key]] song "[[Wonderful Life (Black song)|Wonderful Life]]". It was released independently through [[Ugly Man Records]], and got Black noticed by [[A&M Records]], who signed Vearncombe and launched his international career.<ref name="Larkin"/> Vearncombe said:

<blockquote>By the end of 1985 I had been in a couple of car crashes, my mother had a serious illness, I had been dropped by a record company, my first marriage went belly-up and I was homeless. Then I sat down and wrote this song called 'Wonderful Life'. I was being sarcastic.<ref>''The Daily Telegraph'', [paper only] (28 Jan 2016), p. 27</ref><ref name="Irish Times Obit">{{Cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/funeral-of-singer-black-to-take-place-in-co-cork-1.2520610 |title=Funeral of singer 'Black' to take place in Co Cork |last=Roche |first=Barry |date=Feb 3, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]}}</ref></blockquote>

The song reached number eight in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. "Wonderful Life" was later covered by singers including [[Kim Wilde]] and [[Tony Hadley]]. A version by [[Katie Melua]] was included on the [[BBC Radio 2]]'s ''Sounds of the 80s'' compilation album, and was released as a single in aid of [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] and the Children's Hospital Charity.<ref>{{cite web|author= nero |title= Katie Melua – Wonderful Life Single |date= 3 September 2015 |publisher= Colinvearncombe.com |url= http://www.colinvearncombe.com/katie-melua-wonderful-life/ |access-date= 30 January 2016}}</ref> But its widespread popularity came from its use on several advertising commercials for brands that included [[Standard Life]], [[Cadbury]]'s chocolate and [[Fleury Michon]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 2015, Melua sang a version in an advertisement for [[Premier Inn]]. Vearncombe suffered from the feeling of being a [[one-hit wonder]]:

<blockquote>Once you have had a hit, it's hard to write another song without having that in the back of your mind. For a long time, I would find myself hearing, 'I like it but it's not Wonderful Life'.<ref>Daily Telegraph, ibid., p.27</ref></blockquote>

At first, the single "Everything's Coming Up Roses" flopped, but the follow-up, "[[Sweetest Smile]]" became a UK top-10 hit.<ref name="Larkin"/> The third single, a re-release of "Wonderful Life", was a massive hit worldwide. The [[Wonderful Life (Black album)|album of the same name]], released in 1987, had similar success, reaping commercial and critical acclaim.<ref name="Larkin"/>

Black sold over two million records worldwide with ''[[Comedy (Black album)|Comedy]]'' (1988) and ''Black'' (1991). Disillusioned with having to deal with a big record company, Vearncombe founded the independent label Nero Schwarz (which is the word "black" in Italian and in German, respectively), and released one album ''Are We Having Fun Yet?'' (1993).<ref name="Larkin"/>

After a prolonged hiatus, Vearncombe returned in 1999 to release a string of recordings under his own name. Vearncombe returned to the name 'Black' to release the album ''Between Two Churches'' in November 2005. On this album, he included a song mocking the success of his hit "Wonderful Life", where he poignantly re-asked the question, ‘Are you having a wonderful life?’

In 2009, he released two albums: ''The Given'' was issued on 4 July as a free download under Vearncombe's name; ''Water on Stone'' was released on 17 November as the first Black studio album in four years. In September 2011, the album ''Any Colour You Like'' was released through Black's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colinvearncombe.com|title=Black – aka Colin Vearncombe|website=Colinvearncombe.com|access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref>

In April 2014, Vearncombe started a pledge fund (via the dedicated music crowd-funding site [[PledgeMusic]]) for a new album, co-written with long-time friend and musical collaborator Calum MacColl. This was the first time he had participated in a [[crowd-funded]] project. The project significantly exceeded its funding goals, and he regularly expressed his surprise and gratefulness through video updates on the PledgeMusic site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/black|title=Black: New Album "Blind Faith"|website=Pledgemusic.com|date=28 February 2015|access-date=28 January 2016}}</ref> His experience with the process also contributed to the name of the album, ''Blind Faith'', was released on 13 April 2015. Several months later, he recorded a [[Catalan language|Catalan]] version of "Wonderful Life" as a fundraiser for the Catalan telethon ''[[La Marató de TV3]]''. Vearncombe sang a Catalan translation of the original lyrics.

==Death==
On 10 January 2016, Vearncombe was involved in a [[Traffic collision|car accident]], near [[Cork Airport]] in Ireland, and placed in a [[Induced coma|medically-induced coma]] after sustaining serious head injuries. He died from his injuries at the [[intensive care unit]] of [[Cork University Hospital]] on 26 January 2016, at the age of 53.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Hann|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/26/colin-vearncombe-dies-the-voice-of-black-aged-53 |title=Colin Vearncombe, the voice of Black, dies, aged 53|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref> Vearncombe left a widow, [[Swedes|Swedish]] opera singer and former [[One 2 Many]] singer Camilla Griehsel, and three children.<ref name=guardian /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35414315|title= Wonderful Life singer Colin Vearncombe dies after car crash|work=BBC News|date=26 January 2016|access-date=28 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12125273/Colin-Vearncombe-singer-songwriter-obituary.html|title= Colin Vearncombe, singer-songwriter – obituary|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=27 January 2016|access-date=28 January 2016}}</ref> His remains were [[Cremation|cremated]] on 4 February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-schull-ireland-3rd-february-2016-colin-vearncombe-aka-black-is-shouldered-94677643.html|title=Stock Photo – Schull, Ireland. 3rd February, 2016.
