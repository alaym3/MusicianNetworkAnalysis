The band broke up in 2009, but reformed in December 2011.

==History==

===''Rebuild'' and ''From Anger and Rage'' (2004–2007)===

Upon solidifying their lineup, Verse signed to Rivalry Records for their first full length ''Rebuild'', which was recorded in May 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=3280|title=Verse (ex-WFTF) joins Rival Records roster|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> After the release of ''Rebuild'', Verse went on to a heavy touring schedule. During August 2004, when the band was touring through South Carolina, they encountered some van troubles. While the van was getting fixed, approximately $10,000 worth of musical equipment and a sentimental childhood lava lamp belonging to Murphy were stolen from Verse’s trailer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=3745|title=Verse's van breaks down, equipment stolen|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> After finishing their tour of the United States and a tour of Europe with [[Another Breath]], Verse went into the studio to record their follow-up to ''Rebuild'', ''From Anger and Rage''.

''From Anger and Rage'' was recorded by Dean Baltulonis at Atomic Fireball Studios in Brooklyn New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=6670|title=Verse complete new album|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> Upon completing the second album, Verse continued on their rigorous touring schedule, going on multiple US and European tours with bands like [[Guns Up!]], [[Crime in Stereo]], [[Down to Nothing]], [[Shipwreck (band)|Shipwreck]], and [[Have Heart]]. After a solid year and a half of touring in support of ''From Anger and Rage'', Verse signed with [[Bridge 9 Records]] to release their third full length, ''Aggression''. This album was also released in Germany through Prügelprinz Records<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction%3Dblog.view%26friendId%3D133294529%26blogId%3D416838157 |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=February 7, 2009 }}</ref>

===''Aggression'' and breakup (2008–2010)===
''Aggression'' was recorded at [[Godcity Studios]], and [[The Getaway Group Studios]] by engineer Jay Maas, and was released on June 10, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=10242|title=Bridge Nine Records signs Verse|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> [[Allmusic]] reviewer Greg Prato described it as "straight-ahead, hard-hitting hardcore".,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/aggression-r1385848 |title=Aggression - Verse |last=Prato |first=Greg |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |access-date=April 8, 2011}}</ref> while Chris Hidden of ''[[Rock Sound]]'' said, "these boys bring a progressive and conceptual approach to their brain-caving brutality that provides a refreshing spin on the norm."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Verse: Aggression |last=Hidden |first=Chris |work=[[Rock Sound]] |location=London |date=August 2008 |issue=112 |page=96 |issn=1465-0185}}</ref>  After the release of ''Aggression'', Verse set back out on their heavy touring schedule, having already done one US tour with Have Heart, and two European tours with Have Heart, Shipwreck, and I Rise.

According to an article on KillYourStereo.com, in late 2008, Berg "broke edge" - meaning he decided to stop adhering to [[straight edge]] principles. The article quoted a posting from Berg on a Bridge 9 message board that read, in part, "about two weeks ago I decided that I no longer wanted to be straight edge so I made some changes in my life. This means that Verse is no longer a straight edge band and I'm not going to pretend like Verse was never a straight edge band because that would just be lame".<ref>[http://www.killyourstereo.com/news/0/2034/verse-break-edge/ Verse break edge] KillYourStereo.com, October 19, 2008. Retrieved February 13, 2009.</ref>

In his message, Berg said Verse would continue as a band, but on February 8, 2009, the band issued a statement on their [[MySpace]] page announcing their breakup;<ref>See http://www.myspace.com/verse; also [http://www.punknews.org/article/32266 Break-ups: Verse (2003-2009)] Punknews.org, February 9, 2009.

Following the breakup front man Sean Murphy took up making pizza at the uber-hip [[Nice Slice]] pizza parlor on Providence's esteemed [[Thayer St.]] and formed the band [[Mouth of Flowers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Mouth+Of+Flowers|title=Mouth Of Flowers — Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and photos at Last.fm|website=Last.fm|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref>
