==Career==

Winston Foster was abandoned by his parents and grew up in the Maxfield Children's Home and the [[Catholic Church|Catholic orphanage]] [[Alpha Boys School]] in Kingston, and was shunned due to having [[albinism]], which was not typically socially accepted in Jamaica.<ref name="Campbell1808">Campbell, Howard (2018) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/gold-medal-for-yellowman_141573?profile=1116 Gold medal for Yellowman] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821124658/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/gold-medal-for-yellowman_141573?profile=1116 |date=21 August 2018 }}", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 20 August 2018.

His first album release was in 1982 entitled ''Mister Yellowman'' followed by ''Zungguzungguguzungguzeng'' in 1983 earning instant success. Yellowman's sexually explicit lyrics in popular songs such as "Mad Over Me" boasted of his sexual prowess, like those of other reggae singers/deejays, earned Yellowman criticism in the mid-1980s.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yellowman-mn0000681340/biography |title=Yellowman – Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=24 December 2012 |archive-date=13 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113033021/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yellowman-mn0000681340/biography |url-status=live }}</ref> Yellowman appeared in ''Jamaican Dancehall Volcano Hi-power 1983'' which featured other major dancehall musicians such as [[Massive Dread]], [[Josey Wales]], [[Burro Banton]] and [[Eek-A-Mouse]].<ref name="AMG"/>

He had success in 1987 with a version of "[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]", that topped the charts for several weeks in Jamaica. Yellowman had met [[Fats Domino]] where he performed on the island earlier in the decade, and Domino had presented him with a copy of his version.<ref>Campbell, Howard (2017) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/yellowman-8217-s-tasty-serving-of_115567?profile=1116 Yellowman's tasty serving of Blueberry Hill] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103132225/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/yellowman-8217-s-tasty-serving-of_115567?profile=1116 |date=3 November 2017 }}", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 31 October 2017.

By the mid-1990s, Yellowman released socially conscious material, rising to international fame along with singers such as [[Buju Banton]]. Yellowman became the island's most popular deejay. During the early 1980s, Yellowman had over 40 singles and produced up to five albums per year.<ref name="AMG"/>

He re-invented himself with his 1994 album ''Prayer'', which stepped away from the slackness that gave him his initial fame.<ref name="AMG"/> His latest albums are ''New York'' (2003), ''Round 1'' (2005), and ''No More War'' (2019). Yellowman was also a featured guest vocalist on the [[Run-DMC]] track "Roots Rap Reggae".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/6761377/a/King+Of+Rock.htm |title=Run-DMC – King of Rock CD Album |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=11 September 2003 |access-date=24 December 2012}}</ref> Yellowman continues to perform internationally with his Sagittarius Band, and has toured through places such as [[Nigeria]] where he retains a following of fans, as well as Spain, Peru, Sweden, Italy, Germany, Britain, France, Kenya, the United States and Canada. He also featured on [[OPM (band)|OPM]]'s 2004 album,  ''[[Forthemasses]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 2018, it was announced that he would be awarded the [[Order of Distinction]] (Officer Class) by the Jamaican government.<ref name="Campbell1808" />

===Philosophy===
He has spoken against violence. In the ''Montreal Mirror'' in 2005 he said, "Now it's not your entertainment or teaching. If you notice the hip hop and dancehall artists today, all they do they sing about drugs, clothes, car, house—when they can't get it, they start get violent. ... I know what violence is like and what it contain and what it can do. I'm glad that the roots is coming back."<ref name="montrealmirror" /> The slackness style with which Yellowman is associated sometimes has homophobic lyrics.<ref name="AMG" /> However, in the same ''Montreal Mirror'' article he spoke against it: "Everybody listen to me ... I don't do songs against gay people, I don't do violent lyric against gay people. If you don't like a person or you don't like a thing, you don't talk about it. You don't come on stage and say kill them or burn them because everybody have a right to live."<ref name="montrealmirror">{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/070705/cover_music.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050722082808/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2005/070705/cover_music.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 July 2005 |title=Gold timers |work=Montreal Mirror |access-date=19 November 2013 }}</ref>

===Cancer===
In 1982, Yellowman was diagnosed with [[skin cancer]].<ref name="AMG"/> After several surgeries, Yellowman was able to continue his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20020221/ent/ent1.html |title=Yellowman on cancer and crooks – Thursday &#124; February 21, 2002 |publisher=Jamaica Gleaner |date=21 February 2002 |access-date=24 December 2012 |archive-date=13 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113132926/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20020221/ent/ent1.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The cancer went into apparent remission during this time. In 1986 it was diagnosed that the cancer had spread to his jaw; Yellowman underwent very invasive jaw surgery to remove a malignant tumor. This surgery permanently disfigured Yellowman's face, as a large portion of the left side of his lower jaw had to be removed to successfully remove the tumor.<ref name="Campbell1808" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.djyellowman.com/ |title=Welcome to The Website of DJ Yellowman |publisher=Djyellowman.com |access-date=24 December 2012 |archive-date=4 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104131536/http://www.djyellowman.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=="Zungguzungguguzungguzeng"==
The instrumental for Yellowman's 1982 "Zungguzungguguzungguzeng", the "Diseases" [[Riddim (genre)|riddim]] by "Junjo" Lawes, has been sampled and imitated repeatedly since its original release. The original version of this riddim was performed by Alton Ellis for a song called "Mad, Mad, Mad" produced by Coxsone Dodd in 1967. [[Coxsone Dodd]] had already released two dub cuts, "Talking Dub" and "Lusaka", plus a 1980 cut by Jennifer Lara, "Hurt So Good." This riddim came to be known as the 'Diseases' riddim after Michigan and Smiley recorded their song, ''Diseases'', with Henry Junjo Lawes in 1981. 

"Zungguzungguguzungguzeng" was remade by [[Beenie Man]] and released on 3 July 2020. Yellowman said of the release, "I wish somebody else did do Zungguzungguguzungguzeng, maybe [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] or [[Sean Paul]]….Me nuh even hear it."<ref>{{Cite web|date=7 July 2020|title=Dancehall Veteran Yellowman Is Not Pleased With Beenie Man's Remake Of 'Zungguzungguguzungguzeng'|url=https://www.dancehallmag.com/2020/07/07/news/dancehall-veteran-yellowman-is-not-pleased-with-beenie-mans-remake-of-zungguzungguguzungguzeng.html|access-date=15 July 2020|website=DancehallMag|language=en-US|archive-date=15 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715031236/https://www.dancehallmag.com/2020/07/07/news/dancehall-veteran-yellowman-is-not-pleased-with-beenie-mans-remake-of-zungguzungguguzungguzeng.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The vocal melody of "Zungguzungguguzungguzeng" has also been sampled heavily in various reggae and hip hop songs.
