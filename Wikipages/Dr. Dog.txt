'''Dr. Dog''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band based in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2016/02/05/465739431/dr-dog-on-world-cafe|title=Dr. Dog On World Cafe|date=February 5, 2016|publisher=NPR|access-date=February 5, 2016}}</ref> Its lineup consists of Toby Leaman ([[bass guitar]]), Scott McMicken ([[lead guitar]]), Frank McElroy ([[rhythm guitar]]), Zach Miller ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]), [[Eric Slick]] ([[drums]]), and  Michael Libramento ([[percussion]], lap steel, acoustic guitar, bass). Lead vocal duties are shared between Leaman and McMicken, with all members contributing [[harmony|harmonies]]. In addition, each band member has a [[nickname]] beginning with the letter T, and they have explained that friends of the band also receive nicknames, which are drawn from aspects of their lives and personalities. (Former member Andrew "Trial" Jones, for example, is a licensed attorney.)<ref name="Sputnik tags Dr. Dog 'psychedelic'">{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/band/Dr.+Dog |title=Dr. Dog reviews, music, news |publisher=Sputnikmusic |access-date=2015-04-05}}</ref>

The band's musical styling of indie rock is strongly influenced by bands of the 1960s, such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]], but they have also touched upon more unrelated genres since their inception. Their earlier recordings show influence of the [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] sound and pop sensibilities of indie rock bands of the 1990s, such as [[Guided by Voices]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]],<ref name="AllMBio">{{cite web|author=Stewart Mason |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dr-dog-mn0000760214/biography |title=Dr. Dog &#124; Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2015-04-05}}</ref> although recent albums have featured more polished production.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The origins of Dr. Dog trace back to Leaman and McMicken first playing music together in eighth grade.<ref name="dailyfreepress.com">{{cite web|last=Flores |first=Lucien |url=http://dailyfreepress.com/2012/03/18/in-the-heavy-heavy-light-an-interview-with-dr-dogs-toby-leaman-part-1-of-2/ |title=In the Heavy Heavy Light: An interview with Dr. Dog's Toby Leaman, Part 1 of 2 - The Daily Free Press — The Daily Free Press |publisher=Dailyfreepress.com |date=2012-03-18 |access-date=2015-04-05}}</ref> The two never played covers, instead, opting to write all of their own music.<ref name="dailyfreepress.com" /> The band began as an offshoot of Leaman's and McMicken's earlier music project, during college at [[West Chester University]], PA, called Raccoon.<ref name="AllMBio" /> Dr. Dog formed with the addition of Miller, drummer Ted Mark, and guitarist Doug O'Donnell also while attending West Chester. Their early recordings were experimental and recorded on eight track. They self-recorded and self-released their first album ''The Psychedelic Swamp'' in 2001. Starting in 2002, Leaman, McMicken, and O'Donnell regularly played bluegrass with friends at the London Grill in the Fairmount Section of Philadelphia under the pseudonym "Conowingo Homeboys".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hogan |first=Mike |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2008/07/dr-dog |title=Just the Gist: Dr. Dog's Scott McMicken |publisher=Vanityfaircom |date=2008-07-29 |access-date=2015-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/conowingohomeboys |title=Conowingo Homeboys &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2015-04-05}}</ref> Meanwhile, Leaman and O'Donnell split time in both Dr. Dog and another band, Doublehorse!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Dr-Dog.html |title=Dr. Dog Biography |publisher=Oldies.com |access-date=2015-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doublehorse! |title=Doublehorse! – Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and pictures at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2013-11-26 |access-date=2015-04-05}}</ref> They released [[Toothbrush (album)|''Toothbrush'']] in 2002. Mark left the band in 2003 and O'Donnell left in 2004. Juston Stens replaced Ted Mark on drums. The band's early years were spent largely in Philadelphia where they developed a small but dedicated fanbase touring with other local bands such as [[The Teeth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parkthevan.com/img/drdog/DD_Bio_Fall_2006.doc |title=Dr. Dog |publisher=Park the Van records |year=2006 |access-date=August 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721205939/http://www.parkthevan.com/img/drdog/DD_Bio_Fall_2006.doc |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2004, [[My Morning Jacket]] invited them on two tours after a copy of [[Toothbrush (album)|''Toothbrush'']] was given to [[Jim James]] after a [[My Morning Jacket]] show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/arts-and-culture/canine_teeth-38384464.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610212804/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/arts-and-culture/canine_teeth-38384464.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 10, 2015 |title=Canine Teeth |publisher=Philadelphia Weekly |date=June 2, 2004 |access-date=October 26, 2011 }}</ref> Soon after, ''The New York Times'' music critic Kelefa Sanneh praised the group's album ''Easy Beat'' in a December 2004 article, leading to attention from other critics. They signed with Park The Van Records, who released the album ''[[Easy Beat (album)|Easy Beat]]'', and completed their first cross-country tour in 2005. A music video was released for the song "Fool's Life". Late 2005 saw the departure of Jones, who became a full-time lawyer. Jones was replaced by Frank McElroy, a friend of Stens from New Jersey. The band continued to tour heavily as their popularity grew, due in part to their use of the internet to promote their growing catalog.[[File:Dr. Dog Bowery Ballroom 2015-02-06 5.JPG|thumb|300px|Dr. Dog performing at [[Bowery Ballroom]] in February 2015]]

=== With Park the Van (2006-2009) ===
By 2006, Dr. Dog started using a new studio as well as new recording equipment. Philadelphia engineer/producer Bill Moriarty, who they share the studio with, is credited in helping the members use this new equipment to create particular sounds they wanted in their new recordings due to his vast knowledge in recording tools and methods. That year, they released the ''[[Takers and Leavers]]'' EP. Two of the tracks on the EP would later be released on their next album. In 2007, they released ''[[We All Belong]]'', which has a markedly cleaner production compared to earlier albums. They appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in support of the album.

Through the late summer of 2007, Dr. Dog streamed ten unreleased tracks on their website,<ref>[http://www.weallbelong.net/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902012020/http://www.weallbelong.net/|date=September 2, 2011}}</ref> with a new song debuting weekly. Songs were posted each Monday from July 2 until September 3. These recordings were later released as an album titled ''[[Passed Away, Vol. 1]]''. In 2008, the band released ''[[Fate (Dr. Dog album)|Fate]]''. They appeared again on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on July 17, 2008, in support of the album and on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on April 2, 2009 as well as ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''. The band went on tour with The Cave Singers and label-mates Golden Boots.

=== With ANTI- (2009-2016) ===
[[file:Dr_Dog_Coachella_2009.jpg|thumb|Dr. Dog performs at Coachella 2009]]
On July 29, 2009, Dr. Dog signed to [[ANTI-|ANTI- Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drdogmusic.com/news.shtml |title=DR.

Scott McMicken characterized the album as more modern, and a little more punk rock, more prominently featuring electric guitars, so as to accurately reflect the band's live show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradodaily.com/music-news/ci_16388771#axzz132BbGLpM |title=Dr. Dog's howling at the moon |publisher=Colorado Daily |date=October 20, 2010 |access-date=October 26, 2011}}</ref> In early 2010, [[Eric Slick]] replaced Juston Stens on drums for the Shame, Shame tours although Stens plays most of the drums on the record. Stens continues to make music with Juston Stens and the Get Real Gang. Dr. Dog toured in support of Shame, Shame for about two years and performed again on ''The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson''. For 2010's Black Friday [[Record Store Day]], the band released a limited red and blue 7" collection of four tracks recorded in summer 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordstoreday.com/Page/958 |title=Record Store Day 2010 |publisher=Record Store Day |access-date=October 26, 2011}}</ref> These were the first songs recorded with Eric Slick on drums. They were later rereleased with ''Shame, Shame'' as a deluxe edition of the album.

On October 26, 2011, McMicken announced that their new album, ''[[Be the Void]]'' would be released in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wuog.org/music/2011/10/26/scott-mcmicken-of-dr-dog-talks-be-the-void-their-new-lp-due-out-february/ |title=Scott McMicken of Dr. Dog Talks "Be the Void", their new LP due out February |publisher=WUOG 90.5 FM |date=October 26, 2011 |access-date=October 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110233549/http://wuog.org/music/2011/10/26/scott-mcmicken-of-dr-dog-talks-be-the-void-their-new-lp-due-out-february/ |archive-date=November 10, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Recorded at the band's "Meth Beach" studio and co-produced by Nathan Sabatino of Golden Boots.<ref name="freeweekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.freeweekly.com/2011/11/03/teaching-an-old-dog-new-tricks/ |title=TEACHING AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS |publisher=The Free Weekly |date=November 3, 2011 |access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref> This was the first full album made with Dimitri Manos, also in the band Golden Boots, as an official member of the band. He played drums on ''Easy Beat'' and once filled in for Juston Stens last minute for a whole tour. They released a new 7" on a variety of colors for the November 2011 [[Record Store Day]] including the tracks "Warrior Man" and "Control Yourself" which would appear on ''Be The Void''.<ref name="freeweekly" />  On January 31, 2012, ''Be The Void'' was first available to be streamed on [[Conan O'Brien]]'s website one week before its official release. It was officially released on February 7 on [[ANTI-|ANTI- Records]].

In September 2015, Leaman revealed that the band has revisited 2001's ''Psychedelic Swamp'', and the album would finally get an official release in 2016. He told Kelly Rae Smith of the Charleston City Paper, "It's actually weird working on that stuff, because you know usually when you're working on a record — or almost always when you're working on a record — you're working on new tunes. And with this one, we're working on the oldest Dr. Dog tunes around. It's really interesting. You're almost treating your own songs like they're cover songs, and it's songs that we didn't even really play live, so we didn't have any real concept of what the arrangement would end up being like."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/after-15-years-dr-dog-revisits-psychedelic-swamp-for-a-2016-release/Content?oid=5487926|title=After 15 years, Dr. Dog revisits Psychedelic Swamp for a 2016 release|first=Kelly Rae|last=Smith|newspaper=[[Charleston City Paper]]|access-date=June 3, 2018}}</ref> The album ''[[The Psychedelic Swamp]]'' was released on February 5, 2016 on the ANTI- label and was produced by Nathan Sabatino.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/01/27/463990634/first-listen-dr-dog-the-psychedelic-swamp|title=Review: Dr. Dog, 'The Psychedelic Swamp'|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-12}}</ref>

On November 29, 2016 Dr. Dog dropped a surprise album on [[Bandcamp]] titled ''[[Abandoned Mansion]].''
