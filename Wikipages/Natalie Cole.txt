'''Natalie Maria Cole''' (February 6, 1950 – December 31, 2015) was an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Cole was the daughter of American singer and jazz pianist [[Nat King Cole]]. She rose to success in the mid-1970s as an [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer with the hits "[[This Will Be]]", "[[Inseparable (song)|Inseparable]]" (1975), and "[[Our Love (Natalie Cole song)|Our Love]]" (1977). She returned as a pop singer on the 1987 album [[Everlasting (Natalie Cole album)|''Everlasting'']] and her cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Pink Cadillac (song)|Pink Cadillac]]". In the 1990s, Cole sang traditional pop by her father, resulting in her biggest success, ''[[Unforgettable... with Love]]'', which sold over seven million copies and won her seven [[Grammy Awards]]. She sold over 30 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovensauditorium.com/default.asp?ovens=40&objId=683 |title=The Charlotte Symphony with Natalie Cole |publisher=Ovens Auditorium |date=April 13, 2012 |access-date=February 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416042110/http://www.ovensauditorium.com/default.asp?ovens=40&objId=683 |archive-date=April 16, 2012 }}</ref>

==Early life==
Natalie Cole was born at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, California, to American singer and jazz pianist [[Nat King Cole]] and former [[Duke Ellington]] Orchestra singer [[Maria Hawkins Ellington]], and raised in the affluent [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles|Hancock Park]] district of Los Angeles.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/09/24/sunday/main2036354.shtml Natalie Cole Leaves The Past Behind] Cole Experiences Renewal on New Album 'Leavin' – HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (September 24, 2006) by Caitlin A. Johnson – ''CBSnews.com'' Retrieved on 05-23-07</ref> Regarding her childhood, Cole referred to her family as "the black [[Kennedy family|Kennedys]]" and was exposed to many great singers of [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[blues music|blues]]. At the age of 6, Natalie sang on her father's Christmas album [[The Magic of Christmas (Nat King Cole album)|''The Magic of Christmas'']] and later started performing at age 11.

Cole grew up with an older adopted sister, [[Carole Cole|Carole "Cookie" Cole]] (1944–2009) (her mother Maria's younger sister's daughter), adopted brother Nat "Kelly" Cole (1959–1995), and younger twin sisters Timolin and Casey (born 1961).<ref>[http://www.blacknews.com/pr/tvone-nataliecole101.html Natalie Cole Offers a Candid Look At Her Life in TV One On One Interview Premiering Sunday, Sept. 24 At 9 PM] ''Blacknews.com'' Retrieved on May 23, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103101817/http://www.blacknews.com/pr/tvone-nataliecole101.html |date=November 3, 2006 }}</ref> Through her mother, Cole was a grandniece of educator [[Charlotte Hawkins Brown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digtriad.com/news/local_state/article.aspx?storyid=104720&catid=57 |title=Nat King Cole Widow Coming To North Carolina |website=Digtriad.com |date=June 4, 2008 |access-date=July 15, 2012}}</ref> Her paternal uncle [[Freddy Cole]] was a singer and pianist with numerous albums and awards.

Cole enrolled in Northfield School for Girls, an elite New England preparatory school (since 1971 known as [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]] after merging with another school) before her father died of lung cancer in February 1965. Soon afterwards she began having a difficult relationship with her mother. She enrolled in the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. She transferred briefly to [[University of Southern California]] where she pledged the Upsilon chapter of [[Delta Sigma Theta]] sorority. She later transferred back to the University of Massachusetts, where she majored in Child Psychology and minored in German, graduating in 1972.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Natalie-Cole|title=Natalie Cole {{!}} American singer|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=June 25, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amherstbulletin.com/Archives/2016/01/j8nataliecole-hg-010416|title=Recalling Cole's Amherst days|last=Merzbach|first=Scott|website=amherstbulletin.com|access-date=June 25, 2018}}</ref>

==Music career==
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2016}}

===Early career===
[[File:Natalie and Carole Cole 1975.jpg|thumb|upright|Natalie and [[Carole Cole]] at NBC studios, 1975]]

Cole grew up listening to a variety of music that included [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. After graduation in 1972 she began singing at small clubs with her band, Black Magic. Clubs initially welcomed her because she was Nat King Cole's daughter, only to be disappointed when she began singing cover versions of R&B and rock songs.

With the assistance of [[Chuck Jackson]] and Marvin Yancy, a songwriting and producing duo, she recorded some songs in a studio in Chicago that was owned by [[Curtis Mayfield]]. Her demo tapes led to a contract with [[Capitol Records|Capitol]],<ref name="Wynn">{{cite web |last1=Wynn |first1=Ron |title=Natalie Cole |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/natalie-cole-mn0000074195/biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=September 23, 2018}}</ref> resulting in the release of Cole's debut album, ''[[Inseparable (album)|Inseparable]]'', which included songs that reminded listeners of [[Aretha Franklin]]. Franklin later contended that songs such as "[[This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)|This Will Be]]", "I Can't Say No", and others were offered to her while she was recording the album ''[[You (Aretha Franklin album)|You]]'' but she had turned them down. Released in 1975, the album became an instant success thanks to "This Will Be", which became a top ten hit and won her a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]. A second single, "[[Inseparable (song)|Inseparable]]", also became a hit. Both songs reached number-one on the R&B chart. Cole also won [[Best New Artist]] at the Grammy Awards for her accomplishments, making her the first African-American artist to attain that feat.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The media's billing of Cole as the "new Aretha Franklin" started a rivalry between the two singers. The feud boiled over at the 1976 Grammy Awards when Cole beat Franklin in the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance category, a category which Franklin had won eight times before losing to Cole.

===Stardom===
Becoming an instant star, Cole responded to critics who predicted a sophomore slump with ''[[Natalie (Natalie Cole album)|Natalie]]'', released in 1976. The album, like ''Inseparable'', became a gold success thanks to the [[funk]]-influenced cut "[[Sophisticated Lady (She's a Different Lady)|Sophisticated Lady]]" and the [[jazz]]-influenced "Mr. Melody".

Cole released her first [[Music recording sales certifications|platinum]] record with her third release, ''[[Unpredictable (Natalie Cole album)|Unpredictable]]'', mainly thanks to the number-one R&B hit "[[I've Got Love on My Mind]]". Originally an album track, the album's closer, "I'm Catching Hell", nonetheless became a popular Cole song during live concert shows. Later in 1977, Cole issued her fourth release and second platinum album, ''[[Thankful (Natalie Cole album)|Thankful]]'', which included another signature Cole hit, "[[Our Love (Natalie Cole song)|Our Love]]". Cole was the first female artist to have two platinum albums in one year. To capitalize on her fame, Cole starred on her own TV special, which attracted such celebrities as [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], and also appeared on the TV special, "Sinatra and Friends". In 1978, Cole released her first live album, ''[[Natalie Live!]]''

In early 1979, the singer was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. That same year, she released two more albums, ''[[I Love You So]]'' and the [[Peabo Bryson]] duet album, ''[[We're the Best of Friends]]''. Both albums reached gold status in the U.S., reflecting her continuing popularity.

=== Detour and resurgence ===
Following the release of her eighth album, 1980's ''[[Don't Look Back (Natalie Cole album)|Don't Look Back]]'', Cole's career began to take a detour. While Cole scored an [[adult contemporary]] hit with the [[soft rock]] ballad "Someone That I Used to Love" off the album, the album itself failed to go gold. In 1981, Cole's personal problems, including battles with [[drug addiction]], began to attract public notice, and her career suffered as a result. In 1983, following the release of her album ''[[I'm Ready (Natalie Cole album)|I'm Ready]]'', released on [[Epic Records|Epic]], Cole entered a rehab facility in Connecticut and stayed there for a period of six months.

Following her release, she signed with the [[Atco Records|Atco]] imprint [[Modern Records (1980)|Modern Records]] and released ''[[Dangerous (Natalie Cole album)|Dangerous]]'', which started a slow resurgence for Cole in terms of record sales and chart success. In 1987, she changed to [[Manhattan Records|EMI-Manhattan Records]] and released the album ''[[Everlasting (Natalie Cole album)|Everlasting]]'', which returned her to the top of the charts thanks to singles such as "Jump Start (My Heart)", the top ten ballad, "[[I Live for Your Love]]", and her dance-pop cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Pink Cadillac (song)|Pink Cadillac]]". That success helped ''Everlasting'' reach one million in sales and become Cole's first platinum album in ten years. In 1989, she released her follow-up to ''Everlasting'', ''[[Good to Be Back]]'', which produced the number seven hit "[[Miss You Like Crazy]]", which became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom by reaching number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. While the album failed to reach Gold certification in the US, it achieved international success by becoming her only top ten album in the UK, and later being certified Gold there.

Cole released her best-selling album with 1991's ''[[Unforgettable... with Love]]'' on [[Elektra Records]], which saw Cole singing songs her famous father recorded, nearly 20 years after she initially had refused to cover her father's songs during live concerts. Cole produced vocal arrangements for the songs, with piano accompaniment by her uncle [[Ike Cole]]. Cole's label released an interactive duet between Cole and her father on the title song, "[[Unforgettable (Irving Gordon song)|Unforgettable]]". The song eventually reached number fourteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number ten on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart, going gold. ''Unforgettable...with Love'' eventually sold more than 7 million copies in the U.S. alone and won several Grammys, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance]] for the top song.

Alongside signing for new material with Elektra, she transferred rights of her EMI-Manhattan catalog.

Cole followed that success with another album of jazz standards, titled ''[[Take a Look (Natalie Cole album)|Take a Look]]'', in 1993, which included her recording of the title track in the same styling that her idol Aretha Franklin had recorded nearly 30 years earlier. The album eventually went gold while a holiday album, ''[[Holly & Ivy]]'', also became gold. Another standards release, ''[[Stardust (Natalie Cole album)|Stardust]]'', went platinum and featured another duet with her father on a modern version of "[[When I Fall in Love]]", which helped Cole earn another Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals|Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]].

In 1995, Cole was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the [[Berklee College of Music]].

In 1999, Cole returned to her 1980s-era urban contemporary recording style with the release of ''Snowfall on the Sahara'' on June and second Christmas album ''The Magic of Christmas'' on October, which recorded with London Symphony Orchestra. A year later, the singer collaborated on the production of her biopic, ''Livin' for Love: The Natalie Cole Story'' with Theresa Randle playing Natalie Cole. She also released the compilation ''Greatest Hits, Vol. 1'' to fulfill her contract with Elektra. All albums she recorded for Elektra and EMI-Manhattan are no longer controlled by Warner Music Group; they were sold to [[Concord Music Group]] and are available digitally via [[Craft Recordings]] division.

She changed to [[Verve Records]] and released two albums. ''[[Ask a Woman Who Knows]]'' (2002) continued her jazz aspirations, while ''[[Leavin' (album)|Leavin]]'' (2006) was an album of pop, rock, and R&B songs. Her version of "Daydreaming" by Aretha Franklin was a minor hit on the R&B chart. In 2008, seventeen years after ''Unforgettable... with Love'', she released ''Still Unforgettable'', which included songs made famous by her father and Frank Sinatra. In April 2012, she appeared on the ''Pennington Great Performers'' with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra.

After [[Johnny Mathis]] appeared on a special of Cole's in 1980, the two kept in contact, and in 1992 he invited her to be a part of his television special ''A Tribute to Nat Cole'' for the BBC in England. An album of the same name was released. In 1992, following the success of the ''Unforgettable: With Love'' album, PBS broadcast a special based on the album.

===Drug abuse and recovery===
In 2000, Cole released an autobiography, ''Angel on My Shoulder'', which described her battle with drugs during much of her life, including heroin and [[crack cocaine]]. At one stage as an addict, Cole worked as a prostitute's tout in order to fund her drug habit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12078977/Natalie-Cole-singer-obituary.html|title=Natalie Cole, singer - obituary|website=Telegraph.co.uk|year=2016}}</ref> Cole said she began [[recreational drug use]] while attending the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://people.com/celebrity/natalie-cole-from-addiction-battles-to-chart-topping-success/ | title = From Addiction Battles to Chart-Topping Success: Natalie Cole's Bright Life in the Spotlight | last = Yagoda  | first = Maria  | date = January 1, 2016 | website = People.com | publisher = Time, Inc. | access-date = November 22, 2017 | quote = After dating a boy named Jimmy, she began singing and rehearsing with his band – and also experimenting with drugs.}}</ref> She was arrested in Toronto, Canada, for possession of heroin in 1975.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Fink | first1 = Mitchell | last2 = Rubin | first2 = Lauren | title = Natalie Cole's secret drug peril | newspaper = New York Daily News | location = New York City, NY | language = en | date = October 16, 2000 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/natalie-cole-secret-drug-peril-article-1.879604 | access-date = November 22, 2017}}</ref> Cole spiraled out of control – in this phase of her life there was an incident in which she refused to leave a burning building, and another in which her young son Robert nearly drowned in the family swimming pool while she was on a drug binge.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/26/women.jazz | title = The unforgettable Ms Cole  | last = O'Brien | first = Lucy | date = September 26, 2008 | website = theguardian.com | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | access-date = November 22, 2017 | quote = ...and her young son, Robert, nearly drowned in the family pool when she was on a drug binge.

==Health problems==
Cole announced in 2008 that she had been diagnosed with [[hepatitis C]], which is a liver disease that is spread through contact with infected blood. Cole attributed having the disease to her past [[intravenous drug]] use. Cole explained in 2009 that hepatitis C "stayed in my body for 25 years, and it could still happen to addicts who are fooling around with drugs, especially needles."<ref name="freep">{{cite news |last1=Cohen |first1=Sandy |last2=Fekadu |first2=Mesfin |title=Heir to Jazz Legend with Grammys of Her Own Dies |work=The Detroit Free Press |date=January 2, 2016 |page=5A}}</ref>

Four months after starting treatment for hepatitis C, Cole experienced kidney failure and required [[dialysis]] three times a week for nine months. Following her appeal for a kidney on the ''[[Larry King Show]]'', she was contacted by the organ procurement agency One Legacy, in May 2009. The facilitated donation came from a family requesting that, if there were a match, their donor's kidney be designated for Cole.<ref name="freep"/>
