=== Controversy ===
Her appearance at the 2015 Gather of the Juggalos drew controversy as she was advertised as "Nova Rockafeller and her sexy ass".<ref name="auto4"/> Later in 2017, [[Violent J]] had texted Rockafeller after a scandalous image of her and Tom MacDonald was posted online, which Macdonald later responded to and leaked online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1387455064631296|title=Facebook|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> This exchange began a beef between the three artists. While implications may suggest that Violent J had romantic inclinations for Rockafeller, he claimed to be in a 'professional relationship' with her.<ref name="auto7"/> While cited as a PR stunt for GFBF, Rockafeller denied these allegations and expressed her affection for the Juggalo movement.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/NovaRockafeller/posts/so-my-bf-posted-some-texts-that-violent-j-sent-me-because-he-was-pissed-and-now-/10155228966439561/</ref>
