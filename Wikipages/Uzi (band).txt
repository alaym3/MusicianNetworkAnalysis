==History==
Uzi was formed by Zedek and Lee after Zedek left the all-female [[post-punk]] band Dangerous Birds in 1983.<ref name="zedek,bio">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/thalia-zedek-mn0000031603/biography | title=Thalia Zedek | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=April 7, 2015 | author=Prato, Greg}}</ref> Barnwell was replaced briefly by Craig Federhen prior to Uzi's first concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/85404-Uzi |title=Uzi Discography |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2015-07-22}}</ref>

The band released only one EP, ''Sleep Asylum'', released by [[Homestead Records]] in 1986. The band's sound featured "gritty [[wall of sound]] guitars, tape loops, and heavy drumbeats, accompanied by Zedek's strong vocal presence," which drew comparisons to [[noise rock]] acts such as [[Sonic Youth]] and to a lesser extent, [[Big Black]].<ref name="ny1"/><ref name="uzi-review"/> The EP was included at No. 5 in the annual ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres86.php | title=The 1986 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll | publisher=[[Robert Christgau|Robertchristgau.com]] | access-date=April 7, 2015}}</ref>

Following the release of the EP, Uzi disbanded due to tensions between band members. ''Sleep Asylum'' was later reissued on compact disc in 1993 by [[Matador Records]] in the U.S. and in 1994 by Placebo in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Uzi-Sleep-Asylum/master/207052 |title=Uzi - Sleep Asylum |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2015-07-22}}</ref>

==Post-breakup and other projects==
Before forming Uzi, Zedek was a member of White Women. She released one single with her second band, Dangerous Birds, "Alpha Romeo" (1982, [[Propeller Records (Boston)|Propeller]]). The single's Zedek-composed [[B-side]], "Smile on Your Face", was later included on the influential [[Sub Pop]] compilation ''[[Sub Pop 100]]''.

After Uzi's demise, Zedek joined the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[no wave]] band [[Live Skull]] in 1987, appearing on their albums ''Dusted'' (1987) and ''Positraction'' (1989) and the ''Snuffer'' EP (1988). Live Skull split up in 1990. Zedek then moved back to Boston and formed the more [[blues-rock]]-oriented  [[Come (American band)|Come]] along with former [[Codeine (band)|Codeine]] drummer [[Chris Brokaw]].,<ref name="zedek,bio"/> releasing four albums before they disbanded in 2001. That same year, she issued her first solo album, ''Been Here and Gone'', since followed by two others under her name alone (''Trust Not Those in Whom Without Some Touch of Madness'' and ''Hell Is in Hello'', both 2004) and two as the Thalia Zedek Band (2008's ''Liars and Prayers'' and 2013's ''Via'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/218141-Thalia-Zedek |title=Thalia Zedek Discography |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2015-07-22}}</ref> Zedek also participated in the 1998 [[Suffragette Sessions]] tour.
