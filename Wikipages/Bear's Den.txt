The reservation is close to the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] and is owned by the [[Trustees of Reservations]].<ref name="quab">{{cite web|url=http://www.northquabbinwoods.org/entries/22 |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827164254/http://www.northquabbinwoods.org/entries/22 |archive-date=August 27, 2008 }} New England Forestry Foundation: North Quabbin Woods</ref><ref name="trust">[https://thetrustees.org/place/bears-den/] Trustees of Reservations: Bear's Den</ref>

==Name==
The property takes its name from a large [[American black bear|black bear]] once shot here "though more romantic – yet unsubstantiated – stories exist" according to the Trustees of Reservations.<ref name="trust"/>

==Description==
The Middle Branch of the [[Swift River (Ware River)|Swift River]] passes through the steep [[granite]] [[cliff]]s of Bear's Den reservation on its way to the Quabbin Reservoir.<ref name="trust"/>  The [[Canyon|gorge]] is 75' deep and rimmed with [[eastern hemlock|hemlock]].<ref name="quab"/><ref>[http://www.teabread.com/our_town.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} This source says that the gorge is 100' feet deep but may be less reliable as it also misidentifies King's Phillip's War as an event of the 1700s rather than the 1600s</ref>  At one point, a change in elevation creates a [[waterfall]].  According to one description:<blockquote>
So as you walk the 150 yard path from the road and bear left through the jagged opening in the ridge, you have a limited sense of the waterfall being there until you step through and into this [[amphitheater]] of [[Mother Nature]]. Once inside, you sense an isolation from the rest of the world. It's a great experience and unique for a location so close to the road.<ref name="falls"/>
</blockquote>
A short path leads from Neilson Road into the reservation and immediately splits into a leftward path towards the gorge and a rightward path leading to a small [[cave]] (the [[eponym]]ous "Bear's Den") and a [[stream]]. These trail is less than one quarter mile of easy [[hiking]].<ref>[http://www.newenglandwaterfalls.com/waterfall.php?name=Bear's%20Den%20Falls New England Waterfalls page on Bear's Den Falls]</ref>  The reservation is  "a tranquil spot for hiking and picnicking."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valleyviewpoint.com/spotlights/newsalem.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 31, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509150146/http://www.valleyviewpoint.com/spotlights/newsalem.htm |archive-date=May 9, 2008 }} ''Valley Viewpoint''</ref>  Seasonal [[hunting]] is allowed on the property subject to all state and local laws.

[[Camping]], [[fire]]s, and [[Leash#Leash laws|unleashed]] [[dog]]s are prohibited.  [[Human swimming|Swimming]] is discouraged.<ref name="falls"/><ref name="trust"/>  Bear's Den reservation is open from dusk until dawn.  The property abuts [[Drainage basin|watershed]] land and [[wetland]]s to the west connecting to the Quabbin Reservoir and owned by the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]].<ref name="quab"/><ref name="trust"/>

==History==
[[Metacomet]], [[sachem]] of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] and their war chief during [[King Philip's War]], is believed to have met here with neighboring other [[Nipmuck]] chieftains in 1675 to plan attacks the nearby [[English people|English]] [[New England town|town]]s of [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield]], [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] and [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] (<ref>The official site of the Trustees of Reservations state this meeting as a fact, but other sources mentioned in the footnotes use less definitive language such as "Stories surround this location, such as Indian chieftains meeting and plotting attacks" ([http://members.tripod.com/~ButlerC/AABerkshirePhotos/AABerkshireWaterfall360/AACenteral/BearsDenFallsWeb360/BearsDen1Dec03PCD.htm]) or that this place "is said to have been a meeting place for the local Native American tribes" [http://www.teabread.com/our_town.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} implying that Metacomet's meeting here with fellow sachem might be more legendary than historical.</ref> see note).   Much later, the falls provided [[waterpower]] for [[grist mill]]s in the area as water was carried by a [[sluice|sluice box]], through a channel cut in the eastern cliff, and onto an overshot [[water wheel]].  Trustees of Reservations first acquired the property through the 1968 [[bequest]] of Mrs. Grais Poole Burrage.  In 1988, Mrs. Dorothy Fittz donated additional land.<ref name="trust"/>
