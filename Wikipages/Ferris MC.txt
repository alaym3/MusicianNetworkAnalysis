'''Sascha Reimann''' (born 2 October 1973 in [[Neuwied]]), better known by his stage name '''Ferris MC''', is a German musician, [[Rapping|rapper]] and actor.

==Biography==
Ferris spent his youth in [[Neumünster]], [[Kiel]], and then [[Bremen]]. A recurring theme of social exclusion is predominant in his music.

He graduated from [[Hauptschule]] and served his apprenticeship as an [[auto mechanic]]. At the same time, he was a radio DJ and actor (e.g. [[Tatort]]<ref>https://www.daserste.de/unterhaltung/krimi/tatort/sendung/2012/hochzeitsnacht-100.html</ref>).

Together with Flowin Immo and DJ Pee, Ferris founded the Freaks Association Bremen (FAB),<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p809951/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Ferris MC|last=Jeffries|first=David|publisher=[[All Media Group|AMG]]|accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> which, in the quickly-growing German hip hop scene, achieved success rather quickly. They performed at several events, festivals, and on [[MTV Central|MTV]] and [[Viva (TV station)|VIVA]].

In 1994, FAB released their first album ''Freaks'', on the small [[Independent record label|indie label]] MZEE. Three years later, they disbanded over a private, professional dispute.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Ferris moved to [[Hamburg]] and in with [[Fünf Sterne deluxe|Tobi Tobsen]] and finds DJ Stylewarz, who turned out to be a patient live DJ that was more fitting to Ferris' musical style. He released several records on Yo Mama.

In 1999, he released the single "Reimemonster" with fellow rapper [[Afrob]], which was a success, and followed it with his first solo album ''Asimetrie''. Later the same year he parted ways with Stylewarz, and wound up deeper in the Hamburg drug scene.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

His second LP ''Fertich'' was released in 2001, but the single "Flash for Ferris MC" and the corresponding music video don't fulfill the high commercial expectations. In 2003, Ferris released a musical autobiography, adequately called ''Audiobiographie'' and his last regular album ''Ferris MC''.

On 17 March 2006, his last single was released on the [[greatest hits]] album ''Düstere Legende'''. It concluded Ferris' career as a hip hop artist.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

As Maniax, a [[house music|house]] and [[Electro (music)|electro]] project with Marc Deal, he plays in clubs in Germany, [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

From 2008 to 2018, he was a member of the band [[Deichkind]].
