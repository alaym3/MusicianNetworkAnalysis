'''Urban Cone''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[indie pop]] band from [[Stockholm]], formed in 2010 by current members Emil Gustafsson, Rasmus Flyckt, Tim Formgren, and Jacob William Sjöberg and former member Magnus Folkö while the members, who all shared a passion for music were all still in high school.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.serialoptimist.com/interviews/urban-cone-interview-6074.html|title=Urban Cone Interview|date=2011-08-17|newspaper=Serial Optimist|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref>

==Music career==
The group first met success in late 2010 with their debut single, Urban Photograph, which received high praise and exposure on music blogs around the world and reached #2 on Hype Machine after the release of the band's Our Youth EP in December 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/our-youth-ep/id580214156|title=Our Youth EP by Urban Cone on Apple Music|website=iTunes|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> The EP received positive feedback, with ''[[Earmilk]]'' writing that “the EP exemplifies what Urban Cone is at its finest, staying true to their roots and presenting honest, gritty dance/pop."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://earmilk.com/2012/12/06/urban-cone-our-youth-ep-premiere/|title=Urban Cone - Our Youth EP [Premiere] - EARMILK|date=2012-12-06|newspaper=EARMILK|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref>

After the release of ''Our Youth'', Urban Cone tried its hand in the U.S. market in January 2013 by performing in [[New York City]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/swedish-band-ur/|title=Swedish band Urban Cone playing U.S. shows (dates, streams)|website=BrooklynVegan|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> On May 8, 2013, the group released their debut album, ''Our Youth'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/our-youth/id640849786|title=Our Youth by Urban Cone on Apple Music|website=iTunes|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> which received more than nine million streams only a few months after its release.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.herschelsupply.com/urban-cone/|title=Urban Cone - Herschel Supply Co.|date=2014-01-06|newspaper=Herschel Supply Co.|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> The group has received praise from music blogs such as [[BrooklynVegan]], [[Vice (magazine)|Vice/Thump]], [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] and [[Stereogum]].

In 2014, Urban Cone collaborated with [[Porter Robinson]] on his song "[[Lionhearted]]". Their next single, "Sadness Disease" was released on October 7 and described by [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] as “uplifting at first, but the lyrics are an even deeper dive into sadness, loneliness and exhaustion”.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6274001/exclusive-premiere-urban-cones-sadness-disease|title=Exclusive Premiere: Urban Cone's 'Sadness Disease'|newspaper=Billboard|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref> “We write music in an attempt to create sunshine. It’s a reactionary impulse to create light out of the darkness. If you listen to the lyrics, they’re quite dark. It’s serious music that’s made for dancing,” Flyckt said of the song.<ref name=":0" /> Urban Cone released their second album, ''Polaroid Memories'', on April 29, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/polaroid-memories/id965344181|title=Polaroid Memories by Urban Cone on Apple Music|website=iTunes|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref>

The group's third and final album, ''10-18'', was released by [[Interscope Records]]/Universal Sweden.{{cn|date=February 2021}} The songs are influenced by hip-hop, while retaining effortless Swedish pop melodies. "With the first two albums, we didn’t tell people what the songs were about, because we wanted the audiences to have their own story for what they could be about, but ever since then, we’ve felt like it’s really important for us to tell people what we think in a different way," Gustafsson said about Urban Cone's new sound.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

Urban Cone has cited [[Tame Impala]] and [[Arcade Fire]] as some of their biggest influences.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.yenmag.net/urban-cone/|title=Urban Cone - Yen Mag|date=2015-08-19|newspaper=Yen Mag|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref>
