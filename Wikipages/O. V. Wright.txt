==Biography==
Born in [[Lenow, Tennessee|Lenow]], [[Tennessee]], Wright began singing in the church as a youngster. In 1956, while still in high school, he joined The Sunset Travelers as one of the lead singers of the gospel group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ovwright.org/giant.html |title=Giant Of Southern Soul Part One |website=Ovwright.org |access-date=2014-07-31}}</ref> He later fronted a [[gospel music]] group, the Harmony Echoes.<ref name="Larkin60">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0149-X|page=478}}</ref>  It was during this time that he was discovered (along with [[James Carr (musician)|James Carr]]) by [[Roosevelt Jamison]], a songwriter and manager.<ref name="Larkin60"/> Their first pop [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] in 1964 was "[[That's How Strong My Love Is]]," a ballad later [[cover version|covered]] by [[Otis Redding]] and the [[Rolling Stones]].<ref name="Larkin60"/>  It was issued on [[Goldwax]], the label Wright signed to after leaving his gospel career.  It was later determined that [[Don Robey]] still had him under a [[recording contract]], due to his gospel group having recorded for Peacock.  After his contract was shifted to [[Don Robey]]'s Back Beat label, further [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[hit record|hits]] followed.<ref name="Larkin60"/>  Working with record producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]], success continued on songs including "Ace of Spades"  and "A Nickel and a Nail".<ref name="Larkin60"/>

Wright's hits were much more popular in the deep South.  His biggest hits were "You're Gonna Make Me Cry" (R&B #6, 1965), "Eight Men, Four Women" (R&B #4, 1967) "Ace of Spades" (R&B #11, 1970), "A Nickel and a Nail" (R&B #19, 1971).<ref name="Larkin60"/>  The remainder of his 17 hits charted no higher than #20 on the R&B chart.

Wright was imprisoned for narcotics offenses during the mid-1970s, and, despite a new recording contract with [[Hi Records]] that led to a series of new album releases, commercial success did not follow his release from incarceration.<ref name="Larkin60"/> Wright continued to battle drug addiction in the last years of his life, and in 1980, he died from a heart attack in [[Mobile, Alabama]], at the age of 41.<ref name="Dead"/>

==Legacy==
Wright is among the most remembered voices of [[soul music]], perhaps mostly for being [[sampling (music)|sampled]] frequently in [[hip hop music]].  In 1996, his song "[[Motherless Child]]" was sampled on the [[Ghostface Killah]] album ''[[Ironman (Ghostface Killah album)|Ironman]]'' and on the [[Sunset Park (soundtrack)|''Sunset Park'' movie soundtrack]] on a song also called "Motherless Child".  That and another Wright recording, "[[Let's Straighten It Out]]", have been published on ''[[Shaolin Soul]]'', a compilation of tracks that have been sampled by the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and its members. "Let's Straighten It Out" was sampled in a Wu-Tang Clan song called "America" from the charity [[compilation album]] ''[[America Is Dying Slowly]]''.  "Ace of Spades" was sampled by [[Slim Thug]] and the Boss Hogg Outlawz on a song named "Recognize A Playa".

Wright has been a big influence on many soul and blues singers, including [[Robert Cray]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Cray related artists|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/robert-cray-mn0000830425/related|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=February 1, 2014}}</ref> [[Otis Clay]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Pollak|first=Billy|title=Otis Clay|url=http://www.billyprice.com/Clay.php|work=MusicHound R&B: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|access-date=February 2, 2014}}</ref> [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Taj Mahal related artists|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/taj-mahal-mn0000790604/related|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=February 1, 2014}}</ref> as well as young soul singer [[Reggie Sears]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Reggie Sears|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/reggie-sears-mn0001490135/related|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=February 2, 2014}}</ref> among many others.

[[Johnny Rawls]] joined Wright's backing band in the mid-1970s, and played together with Wright until the latter's death in 1980. The band then continued billed as the O.V. Wright Band for another 13 years, and toured and performed with other musicians over this time span.  These included [[B.B. King]], [[Little Milton]], [[Bobby Bland]], [[Little Johnny Taylor]], and [[Blues Boy Willie]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p117226/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Johnny Rawls|author=Richard Shelly |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 22, 2011}}</ref>

Wright among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news|last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>
