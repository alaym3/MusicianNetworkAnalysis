'''Ice IX''' is a form of solid [[water]] stable at temperatures below 140 [[Kelvin|K]] and pressures between 200 and 400 [[MPa]]. It has a [[tetragonal]] crystal lattice and a density of 1.16 g/cmÂ³, 26% higher than ordinary ice. It is formed by cooling [[ice III]] from 208 K to 165 K (rapidly&mdash;to avoid forming [[ice II]]). Its structure is identical to ice III other than being hydrogen-ordered.{{clarify|date=December 2017}}

Ordinary [[ice|water ice]] is known as [[ice Ih|ice I<sub>h</sub>]] in the [[Percy Williams Bridgman|Bridgman]] nomenclature. Different types of ice, from [[ice II]] to ice XIX, have been created in the laboratory at different temperatures and pressures.
