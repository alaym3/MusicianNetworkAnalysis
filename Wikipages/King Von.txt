He was signed to [[Lil Durk]]'s record label [[Only the Family]] and [[Empire Distribution]].

==Early life==
Bennett was born on August 9, 1994, in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mugshots.com/US-Counties/Illinois/Cook-County-IL/Dayvon-Bennett.123203677.html|title=Dayvon Bennett Mugshot 123203677 - Vonita Bennett Arrest - Cook County, IL|website=Mugshots.com|date=November 21, 2015|access-date=October 18, 2019|archive-date=November 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191107232950/https://mugshots.com/US-Counties/Illinois/Cook-County-IL/Dayvon-Bennett.123203677.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He had six half siblings from his father and three siblings from his mother, Taesha, who he was raised by. His father, Walter E. Bennett, was in and out of his life due to his incarcerations. He was fatally shot when Von was 11. Von would pay tribute to his father in multiple songs, notably in the song "Exposing Me".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenetline.com/the-truth-about-king-von-parents-and-his-kids/|title=The truth about King Von's parents and his kids|website=thenetline.com|date=January 29, 2021|access-date=March 4, 2021|archive-date=February 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227151340/https://thenetline.com/the-truth-about-king-von-parents-and-his-kids/|url-status=live}}</ref>

At age 16, Von went to jail for the first time. This would only be the start of a long course of legal troubles for him. In 2014, he was accused of a shooting that killed one and wounded another. Von was eventually acquitted after a trial by jury. Subsequently, King Von took to rapping, collaborating with Lil Durk. Before his arrest for the charges, Von attended [[South Suburban College]] in Chicago and earned some college credits (he got his GED while being in juvenile). During this time, he also joined the [[Black Disciples]] street gang.
