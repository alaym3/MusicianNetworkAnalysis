'''The Waifs''' (originally styled as '''The WAiFS''') are an Australian [[folk rock]] band formed in 1992 by sisters [[Vikki Thorn]] (harmonica, guitar, vocals) and [[Donna Simpson (musician)|Donna Simpson]] (guitar, vocals) as well as [[Josh Cunningham]] (guitar, vocals). Their tour and recording band includes Ben Franz (bass) and [[David Ross Macdonald]] (drums).

The band's 2003 album ''[[Up All Night (The Waifs album)|Up All Night]]'' reached the top&nbsp;five of the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]], achieving double platinum status and winning four [[ARIA Music Awards of 2003|ARIA Awards]] in October. Two further top&nbsp;five albums were issued, ''[[Sun Dirt Water]]'' in 2007 and ''[[Temptation (The Waifs album)|Temptation]]'' in 2011. The Waifs have three top&nbsp;fifty singles, "[[London Still]]" (2002), "[[Bridal Train]]" (2004) and "[[Sun Dirt Water (song)|Sun Dirt Water]]". The band supported [[Bob Dylan]] on his 2003 Australian tour and then his 2003 North American tour, including a gig at the [[Newport Folk Festival]].

The Waifs founded the independent label [[Jarrah Records]] in July 2002, co-owned with fellow musician [[John Butler (musician)|John Butler]] and their common manager Phil Stevens, which handles their Australian releases.

==History==

===1992–1996: Fisherman's daughters and a farmer's son===
The Waifs formed in August 1992 in [[Albany, Western Australia]], as a folk rock band. The Simpson sisters, [[Donna Simpson (musician)|Donna]] and Vikki (now [[Vikki Thorn]]), had formed a duo, Colours, in Albany to perform cover versions of [[Bob Dylan]] and the [[Everly Brothers]] at local pubs.<ref name="Denton"/><ref name="Gee"/> Their father, Jimmy Simpson, was a seasonal salmon fisherman at [[Torbay, Western Australia|Cosy Corner beach]] and had bought Donna her first guitar when she was 15.<ref name="Denton"/> In February 1992, 20-year-old Donna and her 16-year-old sister Vikki headed off in a [[Volkswagen Type 2|Kombi van]] to tour the state as Colours.<ref name="Denton"/> [[Josh Cunningham]], a [[Moruya, New South Wales|Moruya]] farmer's son, had started playing guitar in 1987, he was touring Australia playing bass guitar for a band.<ref name="Shedden"/> The Simpsons met 18-year-old Cunningham while Colours were playing [[twelve-bar blues]] in [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]].<ref name="Shedden"/> After a ten-minute jam session, Donna invited Cunningham to join Colours, Cunningham later recalled, "there was a connection that Donna felt that I felt as well ... it's always felt very much like a family to me and I felt instantly welcomed into that right from the very start".<ref name="Denton"/> Upon return to Albany, Colours changed its name to "The Waifs" (initially styled as "The WAiFS") with Cunningham on guitars, [[ukulele]], [[mandolin]], [[dobro]] and vocals, Donna on vocals, guitar and [[tambourine]] and Vikki on vocals, [[harmonica]] and guitar.<ref name="Allmusic"/> The Waifs used the Kombi van from 1992 to 1996 to travel to gigs across Australia.<ref name="Denton"/>

===1996–2000: First three albums===
In February 1996, the Waifs relocated to Melbourne, recorded their debut, eponymous album, ''[[The Waifs (album)|The Waifs]]'', which was released in May by independent label Outside Music. The band co-produced it with Jen Anderson and [[Mick Thomas]] of folk rock band [[Weddings Parties Anything]]. Aside from producing, Anderson was a session musician for the album.<ref name="ARDbJA"/> Jason MacNeill of [[Allmusic]] described ''The Waifs'' as "a more than adequate stab at troubadour folk and acoustic pop ... In some instances, the band is guilty of what can be termed funk folk, a style all too often used with little to no benefit".<ref name="AMGWaifsA"/> The group commenced a year-long tour of Australia to support the album.

Their second album, ''[[Shelter Me]]'', was recorded in [[Adelaide]] at Mixmasters Studios and, produced by the Waifs, it was released in March 1998.<ref name="AMGShelter"/> MacNeill felt it was "[s]tructured in a cozy, country-like frame of harmonies and acoustic guitars, most of the album works all too well. A few songs, including the soulful "Time to Part", seem a bit askew from the others, but aren't annoying to the senses".<ref name="AMGShelter"/> Once again, the album was supported by a national tour.

The band released its third album, ''[[Sink or Swim (The Waifs album)|Sink or Swim]]'', in June 2000. MacNeill states, "Abstaining from traditional folk for a more rural, quasi-country sound, the band rarely misses the mark, although "Love Serenade" is just satisfactory'.<ref name="AMGSink"/> They had used [[David Ross Macdonald]] on drums and percussion – he became part of their touring band.

===2001–2007: Chart success and ''Up All Night''===
In 2001, the Waifs hired Phil Stevens as band manager – he also manages fellow West Australian musician [[John Butler (musician)|John Butler]] and the [[John Butler Trio]].<ref name="Petherbridge"/> The band started to play folk festivals in Canada and the United States. In August, the group made its first appearance at the [[Newport Folk Festival]].<ref name="Petran"/> The ''[[Newport Daily News]]'' acclaimed them as "the darlings of [that] year's festival".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In July 2002, the Waifs, Butler and Stevens founded the independent label [[Jarrah Records]].<ref name="Petherbridge"/><ref name="Jarrah"/> The label was initially set up to issue both artists' material in North America, later it handled all their Australian releases.<ref name="Petherbridge"/><ref name="Jarrah"/> The growing international reputation of the Waifs led to the release of ''Sink or Swim'' in the US in 2002 by Jarrah Records. The Waifs first new work for Jarrah was a five-track EP, ''[[London Still]]'', which appeared in July and reached the top&nbsp;50 on the ARIA Singles Chart.<ref name="AusCharts"/> In October, ''London Still'' received two nominations at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2002]] for 'Best Independent Release' and 'Breakthrough Artist – Single'.<ref name="ARIAlist"/>

The Waifs fourth album, ''Up All Night'', was released in January 2003 and debuted at No.&nbsp;3.<ref name="AusCharts"/> It was produced by The Waifs, Chris Thompson, Steven Schram.<ref name="WaifsDiscog"/> For the album and subsequent touring, Ben Franz played bass guitar and double bass, and dobro on the title track. The album was certified gold four weeks after release, went platinum in October 2003 and double platinum in February 2004. The ''Lighthouse'' EP was released in April 2003, which was their second Top&nbsp;50 single.<ref name="AusCharts"/>

Vikki Simpson told ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in October that the album's success had taken the band by surprise, "We were nonchalant about releasing albums. We'd released three already and had learned not to put too much hope behind an album because you're usually disappointed. So it was a surprise, but we took it in our stride. It was all very exciting but it didn't seem real to us because it was such a new experience."

The band supported Bob Dylan on his Australian tour in March.<ref name="Adams"/> Dylan offered the group a support slot on his subsequent tour of North America, including a gig at the Newport Folk Festival.<ref name="Wise"/> During the tour Donna met [[Ben Weaver]], a United States singer-songwriter. They later married and have a son.<ref name="Adams"/> In 2003, the band also participated in [[Big Day Out]], an Australian travelling [[music festival]].

At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2003]], the Waifs won in four categories, Best Roots and Blues Album, Best Independent Album, Producer of the Year and [[ARIA Award for Engineer of the Year|Engineer of the Year]] from eight nominations.<ref name="ARIAlist"/> "Lighthouse" also reached No.&nbsp;12 in the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2003]].

The ''[[Bridal Train EP]]'' was released in March 2004 and made the Australian Top 50 singles charts in April.<ref name="AusCharts"/> The title track tells the story of the Simpsons' grandmother, a [[war-bride]] of a [[United States Navy]] sailor, Bob Cain.<ref name="Denton"/> She boarded the "Bridal Train" from Perth to Sydney and then travelled to San Francisco to be with her husband.<ref name="Denton"/> Thorn won the USA Songwriting Competition for "Bridal Train".<ref name="Winterford"/> The Waifs released a double live album, ''[[A Brief History...]]'', in November which debuted in the top thirty of the Australian album charts.<ref name="AusCharts"/>

A month after the Asian [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Boxing Day tsunami]], the Waifs joined a cast of Australian artists to perform at the [[WaveAid]] concert in January 2005 in Sydney to raise funds for the relief effort.<ref name="WaveAid"/> Later in 2005, they indicated that they had no immediate plans for another album, "We won't be going into the studio any time soon. Our collective focus is too outside of music and career right now to put out an album."{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===2007–2011: ''Sun, Dirt, Water'' to ''Temptation''===
[[Image:TheWaifs.jpg|thumb|250px|The Waifs at the annual [[Falls Festival]] in late 2007]]
The Waif's fifth studio album, ''[[Sun Dirt Water]]'', was released in September 2007. It debuted and peaked at No.&nbsp;2.<ref name="AusCharts"/> Vikki had written the title song, "[[Sun Dirt Water (song)|Sun Dirt Water]]", after meeting her husband.<ref name="Adams"/> By 2007, Vikki had married Matt Thorn, lived on a farm in [[Utah]] and had two children.<ref name="Shedden2"/>

The Waifs performed across Australia in September and October on the SunDirtWater Tour. It started in Broome, and ended at Legs 11, a concert for breast cancer research. In November, the group announced a collaboration with label mates, John Butler Trio, for the Union of Soul Tour in January – February 2008. The tour had five concerts, with shows in various Western Australian cities, [[Denmark, Western Australia|Denmark]], [[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]], [[Swan Valley, Western Australia|Swan Valley]], and two gigs at the [[Fremantle Arts Centre]]. A second live album, ''Live from the Union of Soul'' was issued in January 2009, which peaked into the top&nbsp;50. During 2009, Simpson and Weaver were divorced.<ref name="McCabe"/>

The group released their sixth studio album, ''[[Temptation (The Waifs album)|Temptation]]'', in March 2011, which peaked at No.&nbsp;3.<ref name="AusCharts"/> It was recorded late in 2010 in a basement studio in [[Minneapolis]] over ten days.<ref name="ABC2011"/> Once again, they used the rhythm section of Franz and Macdonald.<ref name="Shedden"/> Simpson had attended rehab at Hazelden Treatment Center in Minnesota in 2008 for her alcohol addiction and wrote the album track, "Just Like Me", about her experience.<ref name="McCabe"/><ref name="Blake"/> As from March 2011, Thorn lives in Utah with her husband Matt and two sons, Simpson in Minneapolis with her son, Cunningham in [[California]] with his wife Jackie, Macdonald in Canada and Franz in Australia.<ref name="Shedden"/><ref name="ABC2011"/> While in Australia, Cunningham recorded his debut solo album, ''Into Tomorrow''.<ref name="iTunes"/>
