Amar Hodžić was born on 22 September 1989 in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. According to Hodžić, he initially showed interest for music as a teenager, but released his first song in 2004 alongside his childhood friend as the ''Corelli'' duo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhoportal.com/domaca-scena/buba-corelli-interview/|title=Buba Corelli Interview (BHOPortal.com): "Hip Hop slušam otkad znam za sebe…"|publisher=BHOPortal|date=21 November 2011|accessdate=10 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617004959/http://www.bhoportal.com/domaca-scena/buba-corelli-interview/|archive-date=17 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2009, he became a member of the Sarajevo [[underground hip hop]] group called ''G-Recordz'' and started using his stage name.

Soon Hodžić was introduced to Jasmin Fazlić, known as [[Jala Brat]], with whom he started collaborating on their [[extended play|EP]] titled ''Sin City'', which was released in March 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/mobile/novost/172472|title=Jasmin Fazlić Jala: Ko je sretan ni u hali nije gladan|publisher=[[Radio Sarajevo]]|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=10 May 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609211854/http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/mobile/novost/172472|archivedate=9 June 2016}}</ref> Their collaborative studio album ''[[Pakt s Đavolom]]'' (''Deal with the Devil'') was then released in December the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ba.n1info.com/a13864/Showbiz/Showbiz/Prvi-zajednicki-album-Buba-Corellija-i-Jale-Pakt-s-djavolom.html|title=Buba Corelli i Jala spremni potpisati "Pakt s đavolom"|publisher=N1|date=11 December 2014|accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/magazin/muzika/sarajevski-reperi-jala-i-buba-corelli-uskoro-objavljuju-pakt-s-djavolom/141128150|title=Sarajevski reperi Jala i Buba Corelli uskoro objavljuju "Pakt s đavolom"|publisher=Klix|date=28 November 2014|accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ba.n1info.com/a35755/Showbiz/Showbiz/Jala-i-Buba-Corelli-Borba.html|title=Jala i Buba Corelli predstavili spot za pjesmu "Borba"|publisher=[[N1 (television)|N1]]|date=8 April 2015|accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref>

In June 2015, Hodžić was arrested under suspicion of drug dealing and spent time in detention until May 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tracara.com/buba-corelli-u-zatvoru-zbog-prodaje-narkotika/|title=Osuđen Buba Corelli u zatvoru zbog prodaje narkotika|publisher=Tracara.com|language=sr}}</ref> However, in December, previously recorded single, titled "Habibi", by [[Serbia]]n artist [[Stefan Đurić Rasta|Rasta]] was released featuring Corelli. The song went viral, counting more than forty million views on [[YouTube]], and rose to become Corelli's first mainstream success. In June 2016, Hodžić was hit on the back of the head with a glass bottle while performing in a [[Doboj]] nightclub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ba.n1info.com/a101254/Vijesti/Vijesti/Buba-Corelli-napadnut-u-nocnom-klubu-u-Doboju.html|title=Buba Corelli napadnut u noćnom klubu u Doboju|publisher=BA|date=20 June 2016|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> Three individuals were arrested following the incident. His collaborative album ''Kruna'' (''Crown'') with [[Jala Brat]], released in November under their own label Imperia, also saw great success bringing them to the regional limelight.

In February 2017, Jala Brat and Buba Corelli worked alongside Serbian singer [[Milan Stanković]] on his single "Ego". In June, Corelli scored another hit with "Opasno" (''Dangerously''). The following month, Bosnian [[turbo-folk|pop-folk]] singer [[Maya Berović]] successfully released her sixth studio album, ''[[Viktorijina tajna (album)|Viktorijina tajna]]'', entirely produced by Jala Brat and Buba Corelli. At the end of July, the duo also released their own single "Ultimatum". In December, they collaborated with [[Austrian people|Austrian]] rapper [[RAF Camora]] on "Nema bolje" (''There Is No Better'').

In April 2018, they released a promotional single, called "[[Mafia (Jala Brat and Buba Corelli song)|Mafia]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/amp/180417097|title=Spot "Mafia" Jale Brata i Bube Corellija za dva dana prikupio više od milion i po pregleda|date=17 April 2018|publisher=Klix|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> Then in May, Hodžić released his solo single "Balenciaga" and in June yet another collaborative single, titled "Ona'e" (''She's''), this time with Serbian artist [[Slobodan Veljković Coby|Coby]]. These songs were a part of the campaign for their first concert in [[Belgrade]], held on June 23, at Tašmajdan stadium in front of 15,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jala Brat i Buba Corelli napunili beogradski Tašmajdan |url=http://ba.n1info.com/a268428/Showbiz/Showbiz-vesti/Jala-Brat-i-Buba-Corelli-napunili-beogradski-Tasmajdan.html |website=[[N1 (television)|N1 BA]]|language=bs-Latn-BA}}</ref> They also performed at [[Skenderija]] in [[Sarajevo]] on 9 August and in the [[Štark Arena|Belgrade Arena]] with Serbian pop-folk [[Aca Lukas]] on the New Year's eve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starkarena.info/|title=Štark Arena info}}</ref>
