Since their formation in 2012, they have released three [[Album|full-length albums]], one [[Extended play|EP]] and two [[Split album|split EPs]]. Their 2014 album ''[[The Tyranny of Will]]'' peaked at 22 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

==History==
=== 2012–2013: Formation, ''Demo 2012'' and ''Worse Than Dead'' ===
Iron Reagan originally formed in 2012 and consisted of members Tony Foresta of [[Municipal Waste (band)|Municipal Waste]], Paul Burnette formerly of [[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]], Phil Hall of [[Cannabis Corpse]] and Municipal Waste, Mark Bronzino formerly of A.N.S., and Ryan Parrish also formerly of Darkest Hour. The name of the band is a pun on the heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]] and the 40th president of the United States, [[Ronald Reagan]].

That year, the group released their first demo, ''[[Demo 2012]]'', through [[Tankcrimes|Tankcrimes Records]] which featured the tracks "Pay Check", "Eat Shit and Live", "Artificial Saints", "Running Out of Time" and "Walking Out". The first two tracks went on to be featured in their debut full-length album.

On March 20, 2013, the band released their debut studio album ''[[Worse Than Dead]]'' through the record label A389 Recordings. It was produced by guitarist Phil Hall. The album received a score of 5 out of 10 by ''[[Exclaim!]]'', saying, "they're basically indistinguishable from their singer and guitarist's main band. Iron Reagan are rounded out by ex-members of Darkest Hour, but their influence isn't nearly as prominent as the [[crossover thrash]] of Municipal Waste."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/iron_reagan-worse_than_dead|title=Iron Reagan Worse Than Dead|access-date=August 18, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Bassist Paul Burnette left the band and was replaced by bassist Rob Skotis of Hellbear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/iron-reagan-mn0003070894/biography|title=Iron Reagan {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref>

=== 2014–2015: ''Spoiled Identity EP'', ''Tyranny of Will'' and split EPs ===
On January 7, 2014, Iron Reagan and [[death metal]] band [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]] released a [[Split album|split EP]] entitled ''[[Exhumed/Iron Reagan]]'' on Tankcrimes. The first side of the record contained four tracks by Exhumed, while the second side contained four tracks by Iron Reagan.

The band independently released their first [[extended play]], ''[[Spoiled Identity EP]]'', on April 1, 2014, as a free [[Music download|online download]]. The EP featured 13 tracks and was under five minutes in total length. A 2015 limited edition re-release on vinyl included two bonus tracks.

Iron Reagan signed onto [[Relapse Records]] and released their second full-length studio album on September 16, 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.relapse.com/item/31577|title=Iron Reagan "The Tyranny of Will" CD - Relapse Records|website=store.relapse.com|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Tyranny of Will]]'' received generally better reviews than their previous studio album. Like that album, this one was also produced by Phil Hall.

In 2015, Iron Reagan released another split EP, this time with Toxic Shock through [[Reflections Records]]. The first side of the record featured three tracks by Iron Reagan and the second side featured three tracks by Toxic Shock.

=== 2016–present: ''Crossover Ministry'' ===

The album was announced through Relapse<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://label.relapse.com/iron-reagan-announce-new-album-crossover-ministry/|title=Iron Reagan Announce New Album Crossover Ministry|website=Relapse Records}}</ref> and was released on February 3, 2017. It received positive reviews on release. ''Exclaim!'' gave the album and 8 out of 10 and stated in their review, "Overall though, ''Crossover Ministry'' is a well-made crossover thrash album that's sure to be a hit with fans of the genre, and could be the selling point for people just getting into it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/iron_reagan-crossover_ministry|title=Iron Reagan Crossover Ministry|access-date=August 19, 2017|language=en}}</ref> As with the previous releases, Phil Hall produced the album.
