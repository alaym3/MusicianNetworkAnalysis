==History==
[[File:Abracadabra triangle (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Abracadabra written in a triangular form as represented in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'']] 
The first known mention of the word was in the second century AD in a book called ''Liber Medicinalis'' (sometimes known as ''De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima'') by [[Serenus Sammonicus]],<ref name="Vollmer">{{cite book|last=Sammonicus|first=Quintus Serenus |author-link=Serenus Sammonicus|title=Quinti Sereni Samonici De medicina praecepta salvberrima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5FOAAAAYAAJ|year=1786|publisher=In bibliopolio I.G. Mülleriano|page=4}}</ref> [[physician]] to the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caracalla]], who in chapter 51 prescribed that [[malaria]] sufferers wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shah |first1=Sonia |title=The Tenacious Buzz of Malaria |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704111704575354911834340450 |access-date=17 June 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=10 July 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html Bartleby] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122135703/http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html |date=November 22, 2008 }}</ref>

The power of the amulet, he claimed, makes lethal diseases go away. Other Roman emperors, including [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]] and [[Severus Alexander]], were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.<ref name="Vollmer" />

It was used as a [[magical formula]] by the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] of the [[Basilideans|sect of Basilides]] in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune.<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abracadabra}}</ref> It is found on [[Abraxas]] stones, which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.

The Puritan minister [[Increase Mather]] dismissed the word as bereft of power. [[Daniel Defoe]] also wrote dismissively about Londoners who posted the word on their doorways to ward off sickness during the [[Great Plague of London]].<ref>Daniel Defoe. [https://archive.org/stream/journalofplagu00defo#page/38/mode/2up ''A Journal of the Plague Year'']. London, Dent, 1911 (1722)</ref>

The word is now commonly used as an [[incantation]] in the performance of stage magic. The word is one of a limited set of words that can be typed in its entirety using the left-handed side of a QWERTY keyboard.
