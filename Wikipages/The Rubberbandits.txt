== History ==
=== Formation and initial recognition (2000–08) ===
Formed in the early 2000s, the Rubberbandits’ initial exposure arose from recorded prank phonecalls. These [[prank calls]] featured on a number of Irish and international radio stations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/30840 |title=Playlist for Put the Needle On the Record with Billy Jam – March 27, 2009 |publisher=Wfmu.org |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com/forums/showthread.php?t=170396 |title=Interview with the Rubberbandits – Peoples Republic Of Cork Discussion Forums |publisher=Peoplesrepublicofcork.com |date=23 November 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> and became something of a [[memetic]] phenomenon in Ireland in the early 2000s. These phonecalls were their primary content until they became a musical stage act in 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cheebah.typepad.com/cheebah_hip_hop_reggae_fu/2008/09/too-many-gee.html |title=Cheebah and all that – Limerick, Ireland: Too Many Gee |publisher=Cheebah.typepad.com |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> - though they continued to use prank recordings as part of their stage act.

The Rubberbandits developed a comedic style that is satirical, surrealist and crude, drawing comparisons to satirist [[Brian O'Nolan|Flann O'Brien]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newswhip.ie/national-2/the-week-the-rubberbandits-took-over | title= NewsWhip Ireland - What's trending, right now |publisher=  Newswhip.ie | date= 9 February 2011 | accessdate= 7 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drop-d.ie/archives/4898 |title=Warlords of Pez and The Rubberbandits, Twisted Pepper « Drop-d – Music Magazine &#124; Gigs &#124; Reviews &#124; News &#124; Interviews |publisher=Drop-d.ie |accessdate=15 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720060552/http://www.drop-d.ie/archives/4898 |archivedate=20 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/padraigreidy/100256255/the-rubberbandits-are-heirs-to-the-irish-tradition-of-great-unsettling-satire |title=The Rubberbandits are heirs to the Irish tradition of great, unsettling satire  |publisher=telegraph.co.uk |location=London |date=23 January 2014 |url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140204013657/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/padraigreidy/100256255/the-rubberbandits-are-heirs-to-the-irish-tradition-of-great-unsettling-satire/ | archivedate = 4 February 2014 }}</ref> The track "Up Da Ra",<ref>{{cite web|author=pappyodaniel |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8mcz0_rubberbandits-up-da-ra_music |title=Rubberbandits – Up Da Ra – a Music video |publisher=Dailymotion |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> employs the literary device of the [[unreliable narrator]] to lambast the Irish phenomenon of [[Armchair warrior|armchair republicanism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=139893844&blogId=458954316 |title=A Note on "UP DA RA" – MySpace-blog &#124; van Rubberbandits 28th dec Mystery tour, Limerick |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |accessdate=15 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120712025551/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=139893844&blogId=458954316 |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Their work explores a number of themes that are of significance to Irish urban youth, including drug abuse, interaction with the [[Garda Síochána]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.limerickblogger.ie/blog/2009/05/rubberbandits-and-choke-improv-events-coming-up-this-week |title=Rubberbandits and Choke Improv: events coming up this week – The Limerick Blogger Archive |publisher=Limerickblogger.ie |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614053345/http://www.limerickblogger.ie/blog/2009/05/rubberbandits-and-choke-improv-events-coming-up-this-week |archivedate=14 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and violence.

Writing for the ''[[Irish Independent]]'', [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Brendan O'Connor]] noted the dark undercurrent and [[Situationist International|Situationist]] elements to the Rubberbandits' work, suggesting "Limerick Gothic" as a label for their aesthetic, to contrast with the "rural Irish gothic" of [[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe]]'s ''[[The Butcher Boy (novel)|The Butcher Boy]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/theres-more-to-these-fellas-than-you-think-30495796.html|title=There's more to these 'Fellas' than you think|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]] |last=O'Connor |first=Brendan |authorlink=Brendan O'Connor (media personality)| date=10 August 2014| accessdate=24 December 2015}}</ref> In 2015, O'Connor suggested that the Rubberbandits had inspired fashion designer [[Christopher Shannon]]'s autumn/winter 2015 collection, which featured models wearing plastic bags on their heads. Noting the duo's transition from "hijacking" [[Spar (retailer)|Spar]], [[Tesco]] and [[Centra]] bags to using bags from JC's supermarket and Chicken Hut, O'Connor praised their interest in local communities and small business, and suggested that their manifestation of "pound shop rage" would lead to further influence in fashion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/style/fashion/rubberbandits-bagonhead-look-is-toast-of-lfw-30916082.html|title=Rubberbandits' bag-on-head look is toast of LFW|newspaper=[[The Irish Independent]]|last=O'Connor|first=Brendan|date=18 January 2015|accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref>

As well as speaking on mental health issues,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/there-shouldnt-be-any-stigma-around-it-rubberbandits-blindboy-calls-for-young-irish-people-to-be-given-tools-to-protect-their-mental-health-35157405.html | publisher = Independent News & Media | title= 'There shouldn't be any stigma around it' - Rubberbandits' Blindboy calls for young Irish people to be given tools to protect their mental health | date= 24 October 2016 }}</ref> Blindboy Boatclub has criticised the art establishment in Ireland, saying that:

<blockquote>"[Galleries and museums] preach only to the converted. They remind us of churches, pure solemn and inhabited by very silent people who don't open their mouths, for fear that someone else might find out that they don't fully understand the art that's on display. Art galleries in Ireland are like big vegan churches, and the curator always wears black, like a priest, and the visitors are there for the free wine. Most people who attend Irish galleries are other artists, and they all whisper to each other about commissioning opportunities inside imaginary confessional boxes."<ref name="GemmaTipton"/> </blockquote>

In 2015, the act represented Ireland at the [[Venice Biennale]] alongside fellow Irish artist Sean Lynch.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.limerickleader.ie/what-s-on/arts-entertainment/visual-arts/the-rubberbandits-to-perform-at-the-venice-biennale-1-6726155 |date= 5 May 2015 | title= The Rubberbandits to perform at the Venice Biennale |publisher= Limerick Leader}}</ref> In the same year, they contributed two videos, "Spastic Hawk" and "I Like to Shift Girls", to an installation in a Japanese art gallery. Boatclub explained that they were comfortable exhibiting in this case "because we believe the creative turn was not necessarily the works we had placed in the gallery but, rather, the act of participating."<ref name="GemmaTipton"/> They have also performed musical comedy on the [[Abbey Theatre]]'s Peacock stage<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.limerickleader.ie/what-s-on/arts-entertainment/theatre/the-rubberbandits-take-the-fistfight-to-the-abbey-1-6583105 |publisher= Limerick Leader |title= The Rubberbandits take the Fistfight to the Abbey |date= 17 February 2015 |quote= ''The plastic bag wearing comedians have almost sold out three shows at the Abbey Theatre - on the Peacock stage - in March'' }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.joe.ie/life-style/rubberbandits-to-thread-the-hallowed-boards-of-the-abbey-theatre/484850 |title= Rubberbandits to tread the hallowed boards of the Abbey Theatre | date=February 2015 | publisher=Joe.ie}}</ref> and are credited as being the first to perform a comedy gig in [[Shakespeare's Globe]] theatre.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/whats_on/event/rubberbandits-continental-fistfight/ |title= Rubberbandits: Continental Fistfight |publisher= AbbeyTheatre.ie |date= March 2015 |quote= ''Continental Fistfight played to ecstatic crowds in the Globe's intimate candle-lit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse – the first ever comedy gig to play the hallowed theatre'' |access-date= 17 January 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160129192653/http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/whats_on/event/rubberbandits-continental-fistfight/ |archive-date= 29 January 2016 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref>
