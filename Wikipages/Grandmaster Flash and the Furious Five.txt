'''Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five''' were American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group formed in the [[South Bronx]] of [[New York City]] in 1978. The group's members were [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Melle Mel]], [[The Kidd Creole]] (not to be confused with [[Kid Creole]]), [[Keef Cowboy]], Scorpio and Rahiem. The group's use of [[turntablism]], [[breakbeat]] [[disc jockey|DJing]], and [[Political hip hop#Conscious hip hop|conscious lyricism]] were significant in the early development of hip hop music.

In the late 1970s, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five built their reputation and achieved local success by performing at parties and live shows. By 1980, the group had signed with [[Sugar Hill Records (hip hop label)|Sugar Hill Records]]. Under Sugar Hill Records, the group rose to prominence in the early 1980s with their first hit "Freedom". It was not until the release of the song "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" in 1982 and the [[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five album)|album of the same name]] that they achieved mainstream success. The song provided a [[Political criticism|political]] and [[social commentary]] and went on to become a driving force behind [[conscious hip-hop]].

Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five split into two separate groups, due to differences, until a brief reunion in 1987 led to the release of the original line-up's second album ''[[On the Strength]]''. Afterwards, they disbanded permanently. Today, the group's legacy continues as '''Grandmaster's Furious Five''' with only Melle Mel and Scorpio as remaining members.

The group are widely regarded as one of the greatest groups of all time. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2007; the first hip hop group to be inducted.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite news|title=Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=2009-07-07|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five|access-date=2009-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009103427/http://rockhall.com/inductees/grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five/|archive-date=2012-10-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2002, its first year of archival, "The Message" was one of 50 recordings chosen by the [[Library of Congress]] to be added to the [[National Recording Registry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-2002reg.html|title=The National Recording Registry 2002|date=2011-05-13|publisher=Loc.gov|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208170650/http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-2002reg.html|archive-date=2007-02-08|access-date=2012-04-09}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked "The Message" number 51 on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] in 2004.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1978–1979)===
Prior to the formation of the Furious Five, Grandmaster Flash worked with the "L Brothers", which consisted of "Mean Gene" Livingston, Claudio Livingston and [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]].<ref>Hess, G. ''Icons of hip hop: an encyclopedia of the movement, music, and culture, Volume 1'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007</ref> Flash then recruited his friend [[Keef Cowboy|Cowboy]], Melle Mel and The Kidd Creole (Nathaniel Glover).<ref name=nyt-creole-murder/> The trio called themselves the Three MC's, forming the first emcee group as it relates to [[rap]] as it is known today. Cowboy performed a "scat routine" at a party (at "The Black Door") for a friend who had just joined the U.S. Army. He began [[scat singing]] the words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way that mimicked the [[rhythm]]ic cadence of the U.S. Army marching drill.<ref name="youtube.com"/><ref name="furious5" /> He then worked the "hip hop" cadence into part of his performance. This led to the term "hip hoppers" being used derogatorily by the culture's early detractors, most of whom were from the disco set, to label the music used. This evolved into the term "Hip Hop" and was later adopted by the industry.<ref name="youtube.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8RXefG0Pbc|title=Origins of Hip Hop with Busy Bee Starski|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=November 4, 2019}}</ref><ref name="furious5">{{cite web|url=http://www.grandmasterflashandthefuriousfive.com/cowboy.htm |title=Keith Cowboy – The Real Mc Coy |date=2006-03-17 |access-date=2010-01-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060317071002/http://www.grandmasterflashandthefuriousfive.com/cowboy.htm | archive-date = 2006-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGsfXdMRS4c|title=Afrika Bambaataa talks about the roots of Hip Hop|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=November 4, 2019}}</ref>

Melle Mel and The Kidd Creole were the first rappers to call themselves "MCs" (Masters of Ceremonies). The 3 emcees worked with Flash, who went on to bring in Scorpio and Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams). After the formation of the Furious 5, Flash also worked with rapper [[Kurtis Blow]] doing parties in Queens. During the time Flash worked with Kurtis Blow, it was mainly due to internal disputes with the emcees, so for a short time prior to the formation of the [[Cold Crush Brothers]] in 1979, DJ Charlie Chase was the Furious 5's DJ.

Grandmaster Flash & The Furious 5 were the number one rap group on the streets of [[New York City]] before rap music was embraced by the music industry, setting the standard for all other emcee groups who came after them. The first single they released was "We Rap More Mellow", which was registered under the name ''The Younger Generation''. The name change was made by the producer, who considered it better.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2013/07/05/revisiting-the-furious-fives-unsung-classics-with-rahiem-kidd-creole/|title=Revisiting the Furious Five's Unsung Classics With Rahiem & Kidd Creole|website=Villagevoice.com|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>

The group was popular locally, gaining recognition for their skillful raps and deejaying, but it was not until the [[Sugarhill Gang]]'s "[[Rapper's Delight]]" proved that hip hop music could achieve mainstream success that they began recording. In 1979, they released their first single on [[Enjoy Records]], "Superappin". The group went on to sign with [[Sylvia Robinson]]'s [[Sugar Hill Records (rap)|Sugar Hill Records]], following an agreement that they could perform over a then-popular DJ favorite.<ref name=rollingstone/><ref name=oldschool>{{cite news|authors=Ed Roberts, Solomonic and Da Ewoks and TMGanalog|title=GRANDMASTER FLASH & THE FURIOUS FIVE|website=OldSchoolHipHop.com|date=2009-07-07|url=http://www.oldschoolhiphop.com/artists/emcees/furiousfive.htm|access-date=2009-07-07}}</ref><ref name=VH1>{{cite news|author=Jason Ankeny|title=GRANDMASTER FLASH & THE FURIOUS FIVE|work=[[VH1]].com|date=2009-07-07|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/grandmaster_flash/bio.jhtml|access-date=2009-07-07}}</ref>

===Mainstream success and ''The Message'' (1980–1982)===
In 1980, the group released their Sugarhill Records debut, "Freedom", which reached #19 on the R&B chart and sold over 50,000 copies.<ref name="Grandmaster Flash Biography">, [https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/grandmaster-flash/id4084457 Grandmaster Flash Biography, ''iTunes'']</ref> The follow-up, "Birthday Party" was also a hit.<ref name="Grandmaster Flash Biography" /> In 1981, Grandmaster Flash released ''[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel]]'', which was a multi-deck, live recording of one of his routines that featured [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]" and [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]". The release marked the first time that scratching & turntablism were featured on a record.

In 1982, the group released "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]", which was produced by [[Clifton "Jiggs" Chase]] and Ed "Duke Bootee" Fletcher, the latter of whom wrote the song (Sylvia Robinson added Melle Mel's rhyme from an earlier song to complete the recording). It provided a [[Political criticism|political]] and [[social commentary]] and went on to become a driving force behind [[conscious hip-hop]]. The song peaked at #4 in the R&B chart and #62 in the pop chart, and established hip-hop's credibility in mainstream music. Other than Melle Mel, however, no members of the group (except for background vocals at the end) actually feature on the record.

Their debut album, also named ''[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five album)|The Message]]'', went on to become a prominent achievement in the history of hip-hop.<ref name=rollingstone/><ref name=oldschool>{{cite news|authors=Ed Roberts, Solomonic and Da Ewoks and TMGanalog|title=GRANDMASTER FLASH & THE FURIOUS FIVE|website=OldSchoolHipHop.com|date=2009-07-07|url=http://www.oldschoolhiphop.com/artists/emcees/furiousfive.htm|access-date=2009-07-07}}</ref><ref name=VH1>{{cite news|author=Jason Ankeny|title=GRANDMASTER FLASH & THE FURIOUS FIVE|work=[[VH1]].com|date=2009-07-07|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/grandmaster_flash/bio.jhtml|access-date=2009-07-07}}</ref>

===Breakup (1983–1986)===
In 1983, Grandmaster Flash, who had never appeared on any of the group's studio recordings, sued Sugar Hill Records for $5 million in unpaid royalties. This resulted in the single "[[White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)]]" being credited to "Grandmaster & Melle Mel." The song reached #47 in [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. Another lawsuit was filed over certain elements of the song being stolen from "Cavern" by [[Liquid Liquid]], from which Sugar Hill Records would never recover.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grandmaster Flash|work=Discogs.com|date=2009-07-07|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Grandmaster+Flash+%26+Melle+Mel?anv=Grandmaster+Flash|access-date=2009-07-07}}</ref>

The royalties dispute split the group, and Melle Mel, Scorpio and Cowboy left after "White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)" was a hit. They then formed Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five and released the album ''Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five'' in 1984. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Flash, The Kidd Creole and Rahiem left for [[Elektra Records]] and added three new members to the group: Kevin "The Lord LaVon" Dukes, Russell "Mr. Broadway"  Wheeler and "Larry-Love" Parker. They worked under the name "Grandmaster Flash" on ''[[They Said It Couldn't Be Done]]'', ''[[The Source (Grandmaster Flash album)|The Source]]'', and ''[[Ba-Dop-Boom-Bang]]''. The additional members The Lord La Von, Larry Love and Mr. Broadway formed the "Furious Five" but they could not use the name as Sugar Hill Records owned the rights.

Grandmaster Flash and his new "Furious Five" had hits with their three albums, which made it to the top fifty of ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, whereas [[Melle Mel]] and his group fared better, most notably with the recording of "Beat Street Breakdown", which peaked at #8 in the R&B chart. During this period, Melle Mel gained higher success, appearing in [[Chaka Khan]]'s "[[I Feel for You]]", which won the [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] in 1985.<ref name=rollingstone/><ref name=oldschool/><ref name=VH1/>

===Reunion and waning popularity (1987–1988)===
In 1987, the original lineup of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five reformed for a performance at a charity concert at Madison Square Garden. They soon reunited for their first studio album in nearly five years, recording ''[[On the Strength]]'', which was released on April 1988. Reception of the album was lukewarm, and it failed to achieve the same levels of success as ''[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five album)|The Message]]''. The group never enjoyed the same success as they did in the early 1980s and permanently broke up afterwards.<ref name=rollingstone/><ref name=oldschool/><ref name=VH1/>

===Permanent disbandment and post-''On the Strength'' (1989–present)===
Since disbanding, some members of the group have briefly worked together. Melle Mel, Scorpio and Cowboy released another album as Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five, ''Piano'', in 1989. Keith "Cowboy" Wiggins died on September 8, 1989.<ref>''Vibe'', Dec 1994 – Jan 1995, p.73</ref>

In 1990, Grandmaster Flash produced Just-Ice's album ''[[Masterpiece (Just-Ice album)|Masterpiece]]''. He went on to work as [[musical director]] for ''[[The Chris Rock Show]]'', and later released ''[[The Official Adventures of Grandmaster Flash]]'', ''[[Essential Mix: Classic Edition]]'', and ''[[The Bridge – Concept Of A Culture]]''. He has also received many accolades, including the DJ Vanguard Award from [[Bill Gates]] in 2004, [[RIAA]]'s Lifetime Achievement Award at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in 2005, and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s [[BET Hip Hop Awards#2006 BET Hip Hop Awards winners|I Am Hip-Hop Icon Award]] in 2006. His autobiography, ''The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash: My Life, My Beats'', was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash|last=Saddler|first=Joseph|publisher=Broadway Books|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7679-2475-7|location=New York|pages=Publishing Page|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/adventuresofgran00gran}}</ref>

In 1985, Melle Mel met [[Quincy Jones]] at the Grammys, and they began to collaborate for ''[[Back on the Block]]''. This led to Mel being featured in the song "Back on the Block", which won him the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] in 1991. He would pick up an additional [[Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album]] in 2002 for his contributions in ''Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones.'' 1997 saw him sign onto Straight Game Records and release ''[[Right Now (Melle Mel album)|Right Now]]'' with Mr. Ness/Scorpio. The album also featured Rondo; the two went on to form a group called ''Die Hard''. In 2012, they released an album titled ''On Lock''.<ref name=interview>{{cite news|author=Hartsfeld, Jermaine|title=GRANDMASTER MELLE MEL INTERVIEW|publisher=Tha Foundation|date=2002-02-15|url=http://www.thafoundation.com/melemelintf5.htm|access-date=2009-07-07}}</ref>

On January 23, 2007, Mel changed his name to Grandmaster Melle Mel and released his first solo studio album, ''[[Muscles (album)|Muscles]]''. The first single and music video was "M3 – The New Message". He has also released the children's book ''The Portal in the Park'', which features a CD on which children can read and rap along with him. This project featured a then-unknown [[Lady Gaga]].  She performs with Mel on the songs "World Family Tree" and "The Fountain Of Truth".<ref name=rollingstone/><ref name=oldschool/><ref name=VH1/>

When asked of a possible reunion in 2002, Melle Mel responded:

{{cquote|It['s] not a question of whether we could get together or not [...] I just don['t] think that we could get a deal. The record company people just don['t] see a market for us.<ref name=interview/>}} However, 2014 saw Melle Mel and Scorpio begin playing shows across the United States, UK and Europe as Grandmaster's Furious Five ft Melle [sic] and Scorpio, culminating in them writing and recording new music. Their first single 'Some Kind of Sorry' was released on May 27, 2016,<ref name=Jammerzine>{{cite news|author=Jammerzine (Ryan Martin)|title=First Listen: Grandmaster's Furious 5 ft Mele Mel and Scorpio – Some Kind of Sorry|work=jammerzine.com|date=2016-04-04|url=https://jammerzine.com/first-listen-grandmasters-furious-5-ft-mele-mel-scorpio-some-kind-of-sorry/|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref> to coincide with a UK and European tour, which they are undertaking alongside [[The Sugarhill Gang]].

On August 2, 2017, The Kidd Creole was arrested and charged with the murder of a New York city homeless man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-august-kidd-creole-grandmaster-flash-1501769989-htmlstory.html|title=Today in Entertainment: NBC orders Season 2 of 'Will & Grace' revival and reveals what's in store on 'This Is Us'|via=LA Times}}</ref><ref name=nyt-creole-murder>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/nyregion/kidd-creole-homeless-man-stabbing.html|title=Kidd Creole of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five Is Charged With Murder|first=Matthew|last=Haag|date=2 August 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://time.com/4885237/kidd-creole-arrested-stabbing/?xid=gonewsedit&google_editors_picks=true |title=Rapper Kidd Creole Stabbed Man He Thought Was Hitting On Him |first=Colleen |last=Long |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 2, 2017 |issn=0040-781X }}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
