== History ==

=== Origins ===
Higher Brothers are part of the much larger rap collective Chengdu Rap House (成都说唱会馆), also known as CDC (an abbreviation of Chengdu City), which was formed in the early 2010s. Melo, who was the earliest of the Higher Brothers to join the Rap House, performed in a cypher video in 2012 alongside original Rap House members such as Fat Shady and Sleepy Cat.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/world/asia/china-hip-hop.html|title=With Dreadlocks, Rhythm and Flow, China Embraces Hip-Hop|last1=Qin|first1=Amy|date=2017-10-26|work=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|df=mdy-all|access-date=2017-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108035958/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/world/asia/china-hip-hop.html|archive-date=2017-11-08|url-status=live}}</ref>
Meanwhile, Masiwei began rapping around 2013, releasing three solo mixtapes in 2013, 2014, and 2015, and Melo and Psy.P performed as a duo called 天地会 (TianDi Clan, or TDC), releasing a mixtape in 2015.

In 2015, DZknow, who had recently arrived from [[Nanjing]], released a song with Masiwei and Psy.P called "Haier Brothers" (海爾兄弟) after the old logo of the Chinese electronics company [[Haier]], which features a pair of brothers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/01/22/as-haier-rises-have-its-gay-icons-retired/|title=As Haier Rises, Have Its Gay Icons Retired?|last=Sonmez|first=Felicia|date=2016-01-22|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> After the song received a positive reception, the members decided to form a group and name it after the song.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/xw4bkn/higher-brothers-profile-chinese-hip-hop|title=Higher Brothers Are Chinese Hip-Hop's Greatest Hope|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|last2=Ross|first2=Alex Robert|date=2018-01-28|website=[[Noisey]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-15|last3=Horn|first3=Leslie|last4=Friedlander|first4=Emilie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305112200/https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/xw4bkn/higher-brothers-profile-chinese-hip-hop|archive-date=2018-03-05|url-status=live}}</ref> Over time, the English form of the name became "Higher Brothers".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/26/how-88rising-is-making-a-place-for-asians-in-hip-hop|title=How 88rising Is Making a Place for Asians in Hip-Hop|work=[[The New Yorker]]|last=Hsu|first=Hua|date=2018-03-19|access-date=2019-03-15|language=en|issn=0028-792X|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823114014/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/26/how-88rising-is-making-a-place-for-asians-in-hip-hop|archive-date=2018-08-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> The group's music is inspired by [[50 Cent]], [[A$AP Rocky]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[J.

The quick cycles of media consumerism in China allowed the Higher Brothers to enter the underground Chinese hip-hop scene and explode in popularity within a matter of months, and their international success would soon follow after signing with multinational label 88rising.<ref name=":2" />

=== 88rising and international success ===
The Higher Brothers joined [[88rising]] in 2016 and are managed by Sean Miyashiro and Lana Larkin. Larkin also appeared on a few of their tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2018/03/30/higher-brothers-lana-larkin-translator-interview-88rising|title=Meet Lana Larkin, the woman behind Higher Brothers’s global crossover|website=[[The Fader|The FADER]]|language=en|access-date=2019-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222013511/http://www.thefader.com/2018/03/30/higher-brothers-lana-larkin-translator-interview-88rising|archive-date=2019-02-22|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/the-american-dream-of-the-higher-brothers|title=The American Dream of the Higher Brothers|last=Wong|first=Alex|website=gq.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610200217/https://www.gq.com/story/the-american-dream-of-the-higher-brothers|archive-date=2019-06-10|url-status=live}}</ref> The group first appeared on 88rising's [[YouTube]] channel in 2016 with the song "Black Cab".<ref name=":2" /> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDrLlIj0qes A video published by 88rising] shows prominent hip-hop figures like Kyle, Lil' Yachty, Migos, and Playboi Carti reacting extremely positively to Higher Brothers' hit music video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rILKm-DC06A "Made in China"] skyrocketed their popularity and helped push them into the public eye internationally. The video currently has over 22 million views. The Higher Brothers also appeared in both Adidas Originals and Beats by Dre commercials, and were involved in a photo shoot with Russel Westbrook to promote the opening of a Jordan flagship store in Shanghai.<ref name=":2" />

Due to the success of songs like "Made in China" and "Franklin", the Higher Brothers embarked on a tour through Asia alongside 88rising artists [[Joji (singer)|Joji]] and [[Rich Brian]] in late 2017. In 2018 the group embarked on their North American Tour "Journey to the West", named after their [[Extended play|EP]] of the same name which was released in January 2018. The group released their second album ''[[Five Stars (Higher Brothers album)|Five Stars]]'' in 2019, and embarked on their worldwide "Wish You Rich" tour starting May 2019.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8511125/higher-brothers-interview-five-stars|title=Higher Brothers on How Their Chinese Trap Sound Won America Over: 'We Can Do Some Swag S--t'|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=2019-06-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611031512/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8511125/higher-brothers-interview-five-stars|archive-date=2019-06-11|url-status=live}}</ref> At the end of 2019 the group announced that each member would release a solo album.

== Discography  ==

=== Mixtape: ''Higher Brothers'' ===
The group released a mixtape in 2016 entitled ''Higher Brothers Mixtape''. It consists of 19 tracks including the "original" versions of two songs also featured on ''Black Cab'' - "7/11" and "WeChat". The original version of "7/11" featured a beat that was produced by Deko, while "Wechat" used the beat from Speaker Knockerz's song "Count Up". These beats were most likely changed for the re-released versions due to copyright concerns.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

=== Debut album: ''Black Cab''===
Their debut album ''Black Cab'' was released on May 31, 2017. It features collaborations with [[Keith Ape]], [[Famous Dex]], [[Jay Park]] and more. The album was named for the unlicensed black cab drivers of the group's native [[Chengdu]].<ref name=":2" /> Despite its success, the album is almost entirely in Sichuanese, which made it almost unintelligible for a majority of Chinese listeners.<ref name=":2" /> It features songs from the groups pre-88rising days, as well as new songs written after signing with the label. The album contains the Higher Brother's song "Made In China", which ''[[Vice (magazine)|Noisey]]'' describes as their "most famous track to date".<ref name=":2" /> The video for the song went viral, receiving over 15 million views as of March 2019.<ref>{{Citation|last=88rising|title=Higher Brothers x Famous Dex - Made In China (Prod.

== Significance ==

=== Culturally ===
The Higher Brothers became part of a wider phenomenon in China that ventured from the traditional ways of the past generation. For many in the younger generation in China, the cutthroat housing market and job and marriage markets are extremely competitive and present a lot of obstacles for young Chinese.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xw4bkn/higher-brothers-profile-chinese-hip-hop|title=Higher Brothers Are Chinese Hip-Hop's Greatest Hope|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|date=2018-01-28|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> Higher Brothers are the first Chinese rap group to achieve international recognition, rivaling the overseas popularity of Chinese pop stars like Kris Wu, Jackson Wang and Lay Zhang.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grogan |first1=Bryan |title=Empire Building: How Higher Brothers Took "Made in China" Trap International |url=https://radiichina.com/higher-brothers/ |website=RADII |accessdate=11 November 2020}}</ref>

The group has been able to circumvent Chinese censorship, believed largely due to the unmet need in cultural product of exportable quality. In an older song, Melo rapped "I don't write political hip-hop. But if any politicians try to shut me up, I'll cut off their heads and lay them at their corpses' feet."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/meet-the-higher-brothers-the-rap-group-climbing-over-the-great-firewal-2441103073.html|title=Meet the Higher Brothers, the Rap Group Climbing Over the Great Firewall of China|date=2017-06-16|website=PAPER|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> This line caused him to be brought into the Public Security Bureau for further questioning, but he was ultimately let go.

=== Musically ===
The Higher Brothers bring energy and crowd involvement into their performances through multilingual integration of their music: speaking to the crowd in mandarin while rapping in English, Mandarin, and Sichuanese.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/the-american-dream-of-the-higher-brothers|title=The American Dream of the Higher Brothers|last=Wong|first=Alex|website=GQ|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> This kind of higher level participation from the crowd was largely unseen in the hip-hop scene during the Higher Brothers' come up, but has since become more prevalent.
