'''Randall Stuart Newman''' (born November 28, 1943) is an American singer-songwriter, arranger, composer, and pianist known for his [[Southern American English|Southern-accented]] singing style, early [[Americana (music)|Americana]]-influenced [[Soul (music)|soul]] songs (often with mordant or satirical lyrics), and various [[film score]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kamf |first1=David |title=How Randy Newman and His Family Have Shaped Movie Music for Generations |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/02/randy-newman-musical-family |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=February 18, 2016}}</ref> His best-known songs as a recording artist are "[[Short People]]" (1977), "[[I Love L.A.]]" (1983), and "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]" (1995), while other artists have enjoyed more success with [[cover version]]s of his "[[Mama Told Me Not to Come]]" (1966), "[[I Think It's Going to Rain Today]]" (1968) and "[[You Can Leave Your Hat On]]" (1972).

Born in Los Angeles to an extended family of Hollywood film composers, Newman began his songwriting career at the age of 17, penning hits for acts such as [[the Fleetwoods]], [[Cilla Black]], [[Gene Pitney]], and [[the Alan Price Set]]. In 1968, he made his formal debut as a solo artist with the album ''[[Randy Newman (album)|Randy Newman]]'', produced by [[Lenny Waronker]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]]. Four of Newman's non-soundtrack albums have charted in the US top 40: ''[[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|Sail Away]]'' (1972), ''[[Good Old Boys (Randy Newman album)|Good Old Boys]]'' (1974), ''[[Little Criminals]]'' (1977), and ''[[Harps and Angels]]'' (2008).

Since the 1980s, Newman has worked mostly as a film composer. He has scored nine [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]-[[Pixar]] animated films, including all four ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' films (1995–2019), ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998), both ''[[Monsters, Inc. (franchise)|Monsters, Inc.]]'' films (2001–2013), and the first and third ''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' films (2006, 2017), as well as Disney's  ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' (2009). His other film scores include ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'' (1981), ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984), ''[[Awakenings]]'' (1990), ''[[Pleasantville (film)|''Pleasantville'']]'' (1998), ''[[Meet the Parents]]'' (2000), ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'' (2003), and ''[[Marriage Story]]'' (2019).

Newman has received twenty-two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] categories and has won twice in the latter category, contributing to the Newmans being the [[List of Academy Award-winning families#Extended family|most nominated Academy Award extended family]], with a collective 92 nominations in various music categories. He has also won three [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]]s, seven [[Grammy Award]]s and the Governor's Award from the [[Recording Academy]].<ref name=awards/> In 2007, he was recognized by [[the Walt Disney Company]] as a [[Disney Legend]].<ref name=Disney/> He was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2002 and to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2013.<ref name="rockhall"/>

==Early life and education==
Randy Newman was born to a [[Jewish]] family on November 28, 1943, his father's 30th birthday,<ref>{{cite news|last=Bloom|first=Nate|title=Jewish Stars 2/18 |newspaper=[[Cleveland Jewish News]]|date=February 18, 2011|url=https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/jewish-stars/article_7e0fb163-40ce-5c20-9f17-ee338570edab.html|access-date=January 5, 2018}}</ref> in [[Los Angeles]]. He is the son of Adele "Dixie" (''née'' Fuchs/Fox; August 30, 1916 – October 4, 1988)<!-- "My mom's maiden name was Fox – some of her relations called themselves Fuchs."—Randy Newman -->, a secretary, and Irving George Newman (November 28, 1913 – February 1, 1990), an [[internist]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16 |page=16 |title=Randy Newman's America: A Portrait of the Artist |magazine=Billboard |date=December 9, 2000 |last=White |first=Timothy |volume=112 |number=50 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> He lived in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, as a small child and spent summers there until he was 11 years old, when his family returned to Los Angeles. The paternal side of his family includes grandparents Luba (''née'' Koskoff) (July 21, 1883 – March 3, 1954) and Michael Newman (Nemorofsky) (1874–1948), and three uncles who were Hollywood film-score composers: [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], [[Lionel Newman]] and [[Emil Newman]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stafford |first1=David |last2=Stafford |first2=Caroline |title=Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong: The Life and Music of Randy Newman |year=2016 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |isbn=9781468313802 |pages=7–87}}</ref> Newman's cousins, [[Thomas Newman|Thomas]], [[Maria Newman|Maria]], [[David Newman (composer)|David]] and [[Joey Newman|Joey]], are also composers for motion pictures. He graduated from [[University High School (Los Angeles)|University High School]] in Los Angeles. He studied music at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], but dropped out one semester shy of a B.A.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/randy-newman/biography |title=Randy Newman Biography |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref> In June 2021, he finally completed his degree at UCLA.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-06-11|title=UCLA's 2021 commencement celebrates returning to and redefining normal|url=https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/uclas-2021-commencement-celebrates-returning-to-and-redefining-normal|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-12|website=UCLA Newsroom}}</ref>

Newman's parents were non-observant Jews. Newman is an [[atheist]].<ref name=salon>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/24/newman/ |title=Randy Newman |website=Salon.com |date=August 24, 1999 |access-date=February 11, 2014}}</ref> He has said that religion or any sense of religious identity was completely absent in his childhood. To illustrate this, he has often recounted in interviews an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] incident that occurred when he was young: he was invited by a classmate to be her date to a [[cotillion]] at her Los Angeles country club. He accepted the invitation but was subsequently disinvited by the girl's father, who told Newman that his daughter should never have invited him because [[Membership discrimination in California social clubs|Jews were not allowed at the country club]]. Newman hung up the phone, then went to ask his own father what a "Jew" is.<ref name=salon/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/nothing-but-the-truth-20110727-1i0r7.html// |title= Nothing but the truth: The Whitlams' Tim Freedman talks to his misunderstood hero Randy Newman. |website=Smh.com |date=July 30, 2011 |access-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/bet-no-one-ever-hurt-this-bad-19791101// |title= Randy Newman: Bet No One Ever Hurt This Bad |website=Rolling Stone |date= November 1, 1979 |access-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Randy Newman (1972).png|thumb|Newman playing piano in 1972]]

===Songwriter===
Newman has been a professional songwriter since he was 17. He cites [[Ray Charles]] as his greatest influence growing up, stating, "I loved Charles' music to excess."<ref>{{cite news|author=All Songs Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93183763 |title=Guest DJ Randy Newman |work=[[NPR]] |date=August 4, 2008 |access-date=September 19, 2011}}</ref> His first single as a performer was 1962's "Golden Gridiron Boy", released when he was 18.<ref>{{cite book|author=|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT4|access-date=July 13, 2012|date=November 3, 1962|pages=4–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The single flopped and Newman chose to concentrate on songwriting and arranging for the next several years.

An early writing credit was "They Tell Me It's Summer", used as the b-side of [[the Fleetwoods]] 1962 single, "Lovers by Night, Strangers by Day", which led to further commissions from the Fleetwoods and also [[Pat Boone]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBo8RQLpwtUC&pg=PA47|page=47| title=Randy Newman's American Dreams|author= Kevin Courrier|publisher= ECW Press|date= 2005|isbn=9781550226904}}</ref> Other early songs were recorded by [[Gene Pitney]], [[Jerry Butler]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Jackie DeShannon]], [[the O'Jays]], and [[Irma Thomas]], among others. His work as a songwriter met with particular success in the UK: top 40 UK hits written by Newman included [[Cilla Black]]'s "I've Been Wrong Before" (No. 17, 1965), Gene Pitney's "Nobody Needs Your Love" (No. 2, 1966) and "[[Just One Smile]]" (No. 8, 1966); and [[the Alan Price Set]]'s "[[Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear]]" (No. 4, 1967). Price, an English keyboardist who was enjoying great success at the time, championed Newman by featuring seven Randy Newman songs on his 1967 ''A Price on His Head'' album.

In the mid-1960s, Newman kept a close musical relationship with the band [[Harpers Bizarre]], best known for their 1967 hit version of the [[Paul Simon]] composition "[[The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)]]". The band recorded six Newman compositions, including "Simon Smith" and "Happyland," during their short initial career (1967–1969).

In this period, Newman began a long professional association with childhood friend [[Lenny Waronker]]. Waronker had been hired to produce the Tikis, [[the Beau Brummels]] and [[the Mojo Men]], who were all contracted to the Los Angeles independent label [[Autumn Records]]. He in turn brought in Newman, [[Leon Russell]] and another friend, pianist/arranger [[Van Dyke Parks]], to play on recording sessions. Later in 1966, Waronker was hired as an A&R manager by [[Warner Bros. Records]] and his friendship with Newman, Russell and Parks began a creative circle around Waronker at Warner Bros. that became one of the keys to Warner Bros.' subsequent success as a rock music label.<ref>Fred Goodman, ''The Mansion on the Hill: Dylan, Young, Geffen, Springsteen and the Head-on Collision of Rock and Commerce'' ([[Random House]], 1997), p.65</ref>

In the 1970s, Newman co-wrote with [[Jake Holmes]] the "Most Original Soft Drink Ever" jingle for [[Dr Pepper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/sheetMusicBooks/jingleFolioBooks.html |title=Advertising Jingle Music Folio Books |website=Classicthemes.com |date=24 April 2003 |access-date=26 February 2020}}</ref>

In 2011, Newman endorsed jazz singer [[Roseanna Vitro]]'s album, ''The Randy Newman Project'' ([[Motéma Music]], 2011).<ref>{{cite web|author=All About Jazz|author-link=All About Jazz|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=40042&page=1 |title=Roseanna Vitro: Following Her Muse |website=Allaboutjazz.com |access-date=September 19, 2011}}</ref>

In 2020, Newman wrote a song called “Stay Away” to support people during the COVID-19 pandemic. The song can be downloaded and proceeds go to the Ellis Marsalis Center to support underserved children in New Orleans’ 9th Ward.<ref>{{cite web|title = Stay Away|url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a6Hk2L2G_W0&feature=youtu.be}}</ref>

===Recording artist===

His 1968 debut album, ''[[Randy Newman (album)|Randy Newman]]'', was a critical success but never entered the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Top 200. Many artists, including [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Alan Price]], [[Van Dyke Parks]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Cass Elliot]], [[Art Garfunkel]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[Claudine Longet]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Tom Odell]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Lynn Anderson]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Neil Diamond]] and [[Peggy Lee]], [[cover version|covered]] his songs and "I Think It's Going to Rain Today" became an early standard.

In 1969, he did the orchestral arrangements for the songs "Minstrel of the Dawn" and "Approaching Lavender" on [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s ''[[Sit Down Young Stranger]]'' (aka ''If You Could Read My Mind'') (1970), and for [[Peggy Lee]]'s single "[[Is That All There Is?]]", as well as [[Is That All There Is? (album)|her album with the same title]] (which also contained her cover versions of two of his songs: "Love Story" and "Linda").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peggylee.com/vinyl/vincap2a.html|title=Peggy Lee discography|website=Peggylee.com|access-date=September 28, 2014}}</ref> Also in 1969 he recorded "Gone Dead Train" for the 1970 movie and [[Performance (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] to [[Performance (film)|''Performance'']], starring Mick Jagger.

In 1970, [[Harry Nilsson]] recorded an entire album of Newman compositions (Newman played piano) called ''[[Nilsson Sings Newman]].'' The album was not a commercial success, but critics liked it (it won a "Record of the Year" award from ''[[Stereo Review]]'' magazine), and it paved the way for Newman's 1970 release, ''[[12 Songs (Randy Newman album)|12 Songs]]'', a more stripped-down sound that showcased Newman's piano. [[Ry Cooder]]'s slide guitar and contributions from [[Byrds]] members [[Gene Parsons]] and [[Clarence White]] helped to give the album a much rootsier feel. ''12 Songs'' was also critically acclaimed (6th best album of the seventies according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]]), but again found little commercial success, though [[Three Dog Night]] made a huge hit of his "[[Mama Told Me Not to Come]]". The following year, ''[[Randy Newman Live]]'' cemented his cult following and became his first LP to appear in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, at No. 191. Newman also made his first foray into music for films at this time, writing and performing the theme song "[[He Gives Us All His Love]]" for [[Norman Lear]]'s 1971 film ''[[Cold Turkey (1971 film)|Cold Turkey]].''

1972's [[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|''Sail Away'']] reached No. 163 on ''Billboard'', with the title track making its way into the repertoire of [[Ray Charles]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]]. "[[You Can Leave Your Hat On]]" which was covered by [[Three Dog Night]], then [[Joe Cocker]], and later by [[Keb Mo]], [[Etta James]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] (whose version was later used for the final striptease to the 1997 film ''[[The Full Monty]]''), and the Québécois singer [[Garou (singer)#Live albums|Garou]]. The album also featured "Burn On", an ode to an infamous incident in which the heavily polluted [[Cuyahoga River]] literally caught fire. In 1989, "Burn On" was used as the opening theme to the film ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'', whose focus was the hapless [[Cleveland Indians]].
[[File:Randy Newman (muzikant, opdracht Haagse Courant), Bestanddeelnr 927-2100.jpg|left|thumb|Newman in 1974]]
His 1974 release ''[[Good Old Boys (Randy Newman album)|Good Old Boys]]'' was a set of songs about the American South. "[[Rednecks (song)|Rednecks]]" began with a description of segregationist [[Lester Maddox]] pitted against a "smart-ass New York Jew" on a TV show (this was a joke, because the "Jew" was Dick Cavett), in a song that criticizes both [[Racism in the United States|southern racism]] and the complacent bigotry of Americans outside of the south who stereotype all southerners as racist yet ignore racism in northern and midwestern states and large cities. This ambiguity was also apparent on "Kingfish" and "[[Every Man a King]]", the former a [[paean]] to [[Huey Long]] (the assassinated former Governor and [[United States Senator]] from [[Louisiana]]), the other a campaign song written by Long himself. An album that received lavish critical praise, ''Good Old Boys'' also became a commercial breakthrough for Newman, peaking at No. 36 on ''Billboard'' 200, spending 21 weeks there.

''[[Little Criminals]]'' (1977) contained the surprise hit "[[Short People]]", which also became a subject of controversy. In September 1977, the British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported the following interview with Newman talking about his then-new release. "There's one song about a child murderer," Newman deadpans. "That's fairly optimistic. Maybe. There's one called 'Jolly Coppers on Parade' which isn't an absolutely anti-police song. Maybe it's even a fascist song. I didn't notice at the time. There's also one about me as a cowboy called 'Rider in the Rain.' I think it's ridiculous. [[The Eagles]] are on there. That's what's good about it. There's also this song 'Short People.' It's purely a joke. I like other ones on the album better but the audiences go for that one."<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

Another somewhat controversial Randy Newman number, recorded by both [[Harpers Bizarre]] and [[The Nashville Teens]], was "The Biggest Night of Her Life", a song about a schoolgirl who is "too excited to sleep" because she has promised to lose her virginity on her sixteenth birthday to a boy whom her parents like "because his hair is always neat".

1979's ''Born Again'' featured a song satirically mythologizing the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] (and their arranging style) titled "The Story of a Rock and Roll Band".

His 1983 album ''[[Trouble in Paradise (Randy Newman album)|Trouble in Paradise]]'' included the single "[[I Love L.A.]]", a song that has been interpreted as both praising and criticizing the city of Los Angeles. This ambivalence is borne out by Newman's own comments on the song. As he explained in a 2001 interview, "There's some kind of ignorance L.A. has that I'm proud of. The open car and the redhead, the [[Beach Boys]]&nbsp;... I can't think of anything a hell of a lot better than that." The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] and [[Frank Gari|Frank Gari Productions]] transformed "I Love L.A." into a popular 1980s TV promotional campaign, retooling the lyrics and title to "You'll Love It!" (on ABC) The song is played at home games for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]] as well as the [[Los Angeles Kings]] who use the song along with their [[goal horn]]. In spite of its prominence, however, it failed to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

In 1985 Newman performed a set at the first [[Farm Aid]] concert that included a duet with [[Billy Joel]] on facing grand pianos. Newman performed "[[Sail Away (Randy Newman song)|Sail Away]]".

In 2003 Newman's song "[[It's a Jungle Out There (song)|It's a Jungle Out There]]" was used for season 2 of the USA Network's show [[Monk (TV Series)|''Monk'']]; it won him the 2004 [[Emmy Award]] for Best Main Title Music.

In the years following ''Trouble in Paradise'', Newman focused more on film work, but his personal life entered a difficult period. He separated from his wife of nearly 20 years, Roswitha. He released four albums of new material as a singer-songwriter since that time: ''[[Land of Dreams (album)|Land of Dreams]]'' (1988), ''[[Bad Love (Randy Newman album)|Bad Love]]'' (1999), ''[[Harps and Angels]]'' (2008), and [[Dark Matter (Randy Newman album)|''Dark Matter'']] (2017). ''Land of Dreams'' included one of his best-known songs, "It's Money That Matters", and featured Newman's first stab at autobiography with "Dixie Flyer" and "Four Eyes", while ''Bad Love'' included "I Miss You", a moving tribute to his ex-wife<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBo8RQLpwtUC&q=newman+i+miss+you+ex+wife&pg=PA298 |title=Randy Newman's American Dreams |author=Kevin Courrier |page=298 |year=2005 |isbn=9781550226904 |access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref> (In an interview with [[Glenn Tilbrook]], half of the writing partnership of English pop band [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]], to promote the album, probably on [[BBC Radio]], Newman acknowledged that "I Miss You" was written for his ex-wife. When asked by Tilbrook how his current wife felt about this, Newman said that though he had always been obedient to his wives in most things there was one area in which he did as he chose; "I write what I write", he said.){{citation needed|date=May 2020}} He has also rerecorded a number of songs that span his career, accompanying himself on piano, with ''The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 1 (2003)'', ''The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 2 (2011)'' and ''The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 3 (2016)''. He continues to perform his songs before live audiences as a touring concert artist.

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, Newman's "[[Louisiana 1927]]" became an anthem and was played heavily on a wide range of American radio and television stations, in both Newman's 1974 original and [[Aaron Neville]]'s cover version of the song. The song addresses the deceitful manner in which [[New Orleans]]'s municipal government managed a [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|flood in 1927]], during which, as Newman asserts, "The guys who ran the [[Mardi Gras]], the bosses in New Orleans decided the course of that flood. You know, they cut a hole in the levee and it flooded the cotton fields."<ref>''[[Village Voice]]''.

Domino had been rescued from his New Orleans home after Hurricane Katrina, initially having been feared dead.

In October 2016, Newman released the song "Putin". ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote: "inspired by [[Vladimir Putin|the Russian leader's]] penchant for bare-chested photo ops and a geopolitical approach that's somewhat short of soft and cuddly, Newman has crafted a song that tells Putin's story from multiple perspectives."<ref name =Putin/> Newman explained that the song was from a new album that would be released in 2017, but he was putting out this song early because "I think that people will lose interest after this surfeit of political talk and attention after [[2016 United States presidential election|the election]]....

Newman released his much anticipated new album, [[Dark Matter (Randy Newman album)|''Dark Matter'']] in August 2017. It received positive reviews, many citing its musical ambition as well as its lyrical bite.

Newman's earliest scoring work was for television, creating background music for a 1962 episode of TV's ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'', and later working briefly on the 1960s TV shows ''[[Lost in Space]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', and ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea]]'' and more extensively on ''[[Judd, for the Defense|Judd For The Defense]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBo8RQLpwtUC&pg=PA205  |title=Randy Newman's American Dreams |author=Kevin Courrier |page=205 |year=2005 |isbn=9781550226904 |access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref>  In 1966, an album of Newman's ''Peyton Place'' music appeared, credited to The Randy Newman Orchestra. Newman claims to have been unaware of the album's existence at the time of release and does not include it in the official "complete discography" on his website. He also co-wrote the title song for the 1970 drama [[Cover Me Babe]]. The recording was performed by [[Bread (band)|Bread]].

Newman also co-wrote pop songs for films as early as 1964, co-penning "Look At Me" with [[Bobby Darin]] for ''[[The Lively Set]]'' (1964), and "Galaxy-a-Go-Go, or Leave It To Flint" with [[Jerry Goldsmith]] for ''[[Our Man Flint]]'' (1966). However, Newman's work as a composer of actual film scores began with [[Norman Lear]]'s 1971 satire ''[[Cold Turkey (1971 film)|Cold Turkey]]''. He returned to film work with 1981's ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'', for which he was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]. Newman co-wrote the 1986 film ''[[Three Amigos]]'' with [[Steve Martin]] and [[Lorne Michaels]], wrote three songs for the film, and provided the voice for the singing bush. His orchestral film scores resemble the work of [[Elmer Bernstein]] (with whom he worked on ''Three Amigos'') and [[Maurice Jarre]].

Newman has scored nine [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] feature films; ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', ''[[Monsters University]]'', ''[[Cars 3]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.<ref name=THRD23DoryTS4>{{cite news|last1=Giardina|first1=Carolyn|title=D23: Pixar Previews 'Finding Dory' and 'Toy Story 4'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/d23-pixar-previews-finding-dory-815593|access-date=August 15, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 14, 2015}}</ref> He has earned at least one Academy Award nomination for six of the nine films he has scored for Pixar, winning the award for ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', both times in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. Additional scores by Newman include ''[[Avalon (1990 film)|Avalon]]'', ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]'', ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'', ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'', ''[[Awakenings]]'', ''[[The Paper (film)|The Paper]]'', ''[[Meet the Parents]]'', and its sequel, ''[[Meet the Fockers]]''. His score for ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]'' was an [[Academy Award]] nominee. He also wrote the songs for Turner's ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]''.

Newman had the dubious distinction of receiving the most [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations (15) without a single win. His losing streak was broken when he received the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 2002, for the ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' song "[[If I Didn't Have You (Disney song)|If I Didn't Have You]]", beating [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Enya]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. After receiving a standing ovation, a bemused but emotional Newman began his acceptance speech with "I don't want your pity!" When the orchestra began playing the underscore signifying that the speaker's time on stage is concluding, Newman ordered them to stop before thanking "all these musicians, many of whom have worked for me several times and may not again."

Besides writing songs for films, he also writes songs for television series such as the Emmy Award-winning theme song of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', "[[It's a Jungle Out There (song)|It's a Jungle Out There]]". Newman also composed the Emmy Award-winning song "When I'm Gone" for the final episode.

Newman wrote the music for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''. During Disney's annual shareholder meeting in March 2007, Newman performed a new song written for the movie. He was accompanied by the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]]. The New Orleans setting of the film played to Newman's musical strengths, and his songs contained elements of [[Cajun music]], [[zydeco]], [[blues]] and [[Dixieland|Dixieland jazz]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Newman mines Big Easy music for 'Frog'|magazine=Variety |url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=awardcentral&jump=features&id=Music_Preview&articleid=VR1118011431 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173811/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=awardcentral&jump=features&id=Music_Preview&articleid=VR1118011431 |archive-date=June 29, 2011 | first=Jon | last=Burlingame | date=November 16, 2009}}</ref> Two of the songs, "[[Almost There (The Princess and the Frog song)|Almost There]]" and "[[Down in New Orleans (song)|Down in New Orleans]]", were nominated for Oscars.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Randy Newman, T Bone Burnett Earn Oscar Nominations |magazine=Billboard |date= February 2010 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959521/randy-newman-t-bone-burnett-earn-oscar-nominations}}</ref>

In total, Newman has received 22 Academy Award nominations with two wins, both for Best Original Song. While accepting the award for "[[We Belong Together (Randy Newman song)|We Belong Together]]" in 2011, he joked "my percentages aren't great."<ref>{{cite news|last=Chilton|first=Martin|title=Oscars 2011: Randy Newman wins best joker award|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/Oscars/8352642/Oscars-2011-Randy-Newman-wins-best-joker-award.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=February 28, 2011|date=February 28, 2011|location=London}}</ref>

===Musical theatre===
A revue of Newman's songs, titled ''Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong'', was performed at the [[Astor Place Theatre]] in New York City in 1982, and later at other theaters around the country. The New York cast featured [[Mark Linn-Baker]] and [[Deborah Rush]],<ref>{{cite news |title=A Revue Built From Newman's Music |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/15/theater/theater-a-revue-built-from-newman-s-music.html | first=Mel | last=Gussow | author-link = Mel Gussow| date=March 15, 1982}}</ref> and at one point included [[Treat Williams]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Broadway Musicals, 1943-2004|date=2005|author=Stewart, John|isbn=9781476603292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spQ751Sv7TUC&q=%22maybe+i%27m+doing+it+wrong%22+%22treat+williams%22&pg=PT5193}}</ref>

In the 1990s, Newman adapted Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' into a concept album and musical, ''[[Randy Newman's Faust]]''. After a 1995 staging at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]], he retained [[David Mamet]] to help rework the book before its relaunch on the Chicago [[Goodman Theatre]] [[mainstage]] in 1996. Newman's Faust had a one-time performance at the City Center in New York City on July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Devil Went to Midtown to Serenade the Lord: 'Randy Newman's Faust,' With the Composer on Hand |date=July 3, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/theater/randy-newmans-faust-with-the-composer-on-hand.html|website=The New York Times}}</ref>

In 2000, [[South Coast Repertory]] (SCR) produced ''The Miseducation of Randy Newman'', a musical theater piece that recreates the life of a songwriter who bears some resemblance to the actual Newman. Set in [[New Orleans]] and Los Angeles, it was modeled on the American autobiography, ''[[The Education of Henry Adams]]''.

In 2010, the [[Center Theatre Group]] staged ''Harps and Angels'', a musical revue of the Randy Newman songbook, interspersed with narratives reflecting on Newman's inspirations. The revue premiered at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] in Los Angeles and included among other songs "I Think It's Going to Rain Today", "Sail Away", "Marie", "Louisiana 1927", "Feels Like Home", "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]" and "I Love L.A". The revue was directed by [[Jerry Zaks]] and featured Ryder Bach, [[Storm Large]], [[Adriane Lenox]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Katey Sagal]] and Matthew Saldivar.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=World Premiere of Randy Newman's Harps and Angels Opens Nov. 21 |magazine=Playbill |date=November 21, 2010 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/145128-World-Premiere-of-Randy-Newmans-Harps-and-Angels-Opens-Nov-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104165652/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/145128-World-Premiere-of-Randy-Newmans-Harps-and-Angels-Opens-Nov-21 |archive-date=January 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
