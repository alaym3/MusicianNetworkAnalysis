On 11 April 2015, Scott's audition for the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 9)|ninth series]] of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Just before his audition, his sister Jade also auditioned but was stopped early on both of her songs by [[Simon Cowell]].

Despite obvious nerves at seeing his sister get rejected, Calum performed a cover of [[Robyn]]'s "[[Dancing on My Own]]", which he had heard [[Kings of Leon]] performing on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''[[Live Lounge]]'' in 2013. Following a standing ovation from the judging panel, Cowell pressed the Golden Buzzer giving Scott an automatic place in the live shows. Explaining his decision to send Scott straight to the semi-finals, Cowell said:
{{quote2|"I've never ever in all the years I've done this show heard a guy with the talent you've got. Seriously. And the version was sensational, and that shows to me that actually, you're more than a singer, you're an artist, and that's why you got that (the buzzer)."}} After this audition, Scott received support from stars such as [[Little Mix]] and [[Ashton Kutcher]].<ref>{{cite web|title = BGT favourite Calum Scott on getting sex messages from fans|url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bgt-favourite-calum-scott-sex-5742639|website=Mirror.co.uk|access-date = 6 July 2015|first = Katy|last = Forrester|date = 22 May 2015}}</ref>

In May, Scott released "[[What I Miss Most]]" as the fourth single from ''Only Human''.

In October 2018, Scott released a new single titled "[[No Matter What (Calum Scott song)|No Matter What]]". Upon release, Scott said:
{{quote2|"'No Matter What' is without question the most personal song I have ever written and the one I am most proud of. It's a song born from loneliness, acceptance and the heartbreaking but liberating tale of my coming out experience. What I love about this song is that it isn't just limited to a story of sexual identity, but about the relationship between parent and child and acceptance as a whole. This song didn't make my debut album because I simply wasn't ready at that time to give it to the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auspop.com.au/2018/10/the-purge-375/|title=The Purge 375|publisher=auspOp|date=20 October 2018|access-date=20 October 2018}}</ref>}}

In March 2021, Scott digitally released his first EP, titled ''Only Acoustic'', which featured acoustic renditions of songs from his debut album. The following month, he released two more EPs; ''Only Collabs'' and ''Only Love''.

On June 11, 2021, Scott released a new single, titled "Biblical".  In July 2021, Scott collaborated with Belgian artist [[Lost Frequencies]] singing on a song titled "Where Are You Now", which was released on July 30, 2021.
