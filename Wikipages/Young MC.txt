He is best known for his 1989 [[Chart-topper|hit]] "[[Bust a Move (song)|Bust a Move]]". His debut album ''[[Stone Cold Rhymin']]'' found international acclaim; however, subsequent albums have not reached the same level of success.

==Life and career==
Young was born in [[London]], to Jamaican immigrant parents. He left the United Kingdom at the age of three and later moved to Queens, New York, when he was eight years old.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=374}}</ref> Young attended [[Hunter College High School]] in the Upper East Side of Manhattan (he was honored at the school’s 2018 convocation).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-06-12|title=Grammy winner Marvin Young, '84 (Young M.C.) speaks at 2018 Convocation|url=https://www.hunterschools.org/news-detail?pk=1014736|access-date=2021-08-17|website=Hunter College Campus Schools|language=en}}</ref> He went on to earn a degree in Economics from the [[University of Southern California]] (USC).<ref name=all>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/young-mc-p140446/biography |title=Young MC biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=December 27, 2011}}</ref> At USC, he met Michael Ross and [[Matt Dike]] from the record company [[Delicious Vinyl]].<ref name=all/> Young rapped over the phone for Ross and Dike, who ended up delivering a record contract to his USC dorm room. In 1989, Young collaborated with [[Tone Lōc]] on the songs "[[Wild Thing (Tone Lōc song)|Wild Thing]]" and "[[Funky Cold Medina]]".<ref name=all/> Young gained fame with the release of his single "Bust a Move", which reached No. 7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and won a Grammy for Best Rap Performance.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The single helped Young's debut album, ''[[Stone Cold Rhymin']]'', to reach No. 9 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and attain platinum status in the United States. The follow-up single, "[[Principal's Office (song)|Principal's Office]]", was nominated for 'Best Rap Video' at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards.

Following Young's success, he left Delicious Vinyl, citing restrictions on his work and unwanted changes to his album.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The label sued him for breach of contract and the two parties eventually settled out of court.<ref name=all/> Young signed with [[Capitol Records]] and released his second album, ''[[Brainstorm (album)|Brainstorm]]'', in 1991.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> It reached No. 66 on the Billboard 200. Despite the absence of any strong single, the album achieved gold status in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA – Gold and Platinum |work=[[RIAA]] |access-date=January 2, 2011}} ''Search for "Brainstorm"''</ref> However his third album, ''[[What's the Flavor?]]'', released in 1993, was a commercial failure, with both the album and its singles failing to chart. It was his second and final album on Capitol Records. In 1997, Young released his fourth album, ''[[Return of the 1 Hit Wonder]]'', on the independent label Overall Records. The album produced two singles, "Madame Buttafly" and "On & Poppin" which charted at No. 25 and No. 23 respectively on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart.<ref name=singles>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/young-mc-p140446/charts-awards/billboard-singles |title=Young MC Billboard Singles |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=December 27, 2011}}</ref>

In 2000, Young released his fifth album, ''[[Ain't Goin' Out Like That]]'', on his own record label Young Man Moving Records. The album was Young's first to chart since ''Brainstorm'', peaking at No. 85 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart.<ref name=albums>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/young-mc-p140446/charts-awards |title=Young MC Billboard Albums |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=December 27, 2011}}</ref>

In 2001, Young contributed a song "Deck the Halls" he co-wrote with Kevin Irving, to Disney's TV movie, '''Twas the Night''. In 2002, he released his sixth album, ''[[Engage the Enzyme]]''. Also in 2002, Young appeared as a contestant on ''[[Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|Weakest Link]] – Rap Stars Edition''. He was joined by Rev Run of [[Run-DMC]], [[DJ Quik]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Da Brat]], [[B-Real]] of [[Cypress Hill]], [[Xzibit]], and [[Nate Dogg]]. Young went on to win the celebrity contest, beating Xzibit in the final round. All of the proceeds from his winnings were donated to the Humane Society.

In December 2004, Young travelled to [[Vancouver]] to film ''The Zero Sum''. Young played Mr. Henderson, a publishing company executive. Film director Raphael Assaf and screenwriter Armen Evrensel asked Young to help create the film, for which he is a co-executive producer. Young also teamed up with Baltimore rapper KNOXX to record "Brotherly Love", the theme song from the film.

In September 2005, Young was cast in the [[VH1]] reality show ''[[Celebrity Fit Club (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club]] 3''.  Joining Young was [[Kelly Le Brock]], [[Bruce Vilanch]], [[Tempestt Bledsoe]], [[Countess Vaughn]], [[Chaz Bono]], [[Jeff Conaway]], [[Gunnar Nelson (musician)|Gunnar Nelson]], and Rapper [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]] of [[D12]].

Young also made an appearance in a special episode of ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]'' which featured "The Top 50 Sports Moments of the 80's". Young crafted lyrics and performed a sports-themed rap song alongside [[KRS-One]] and [[Kool Moe Dee]].

After twenty years of living in Los Angeles, Young relocated to Scottsdale, Arizona in 2006. He spent 2007 creating his seventh album, ''Adrenaline Flow'', which was released in 2008. Immediately following ''Adrenaline Flow'', Young released an online-only album, ''B-Sides, Demos and Remixes'', compiled from unreleased, remixed and re-recorded tracks.

In 2009, Young released his eighth album, ''Relentless''. Later that year, Young also landed a cameo role in the [[Jason Reitman]] film ''[[Up in the Air (2009 film)|Up in the Air]]'' starring [[George Clooney]]. Young played himself, performing at a software convention which was crashed by Clooney's character and those of his two female co-stars, [[Anna Kendrick]] and [[Vera Farmiga]].
