At ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Chris Mincher graded the album a B+, saying, "''Supernova'' is a surprisingly bold, enterprising follow-up from an artist who could have easily ridden out the rest of his career on adult-alternative autopilot."<ref name=theavclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/ray-lamontagne-melds-his-folky-formula-throwback-p-203681|title=Ray LaMontagne melds his folky formula with throwback psych-rock|last=Mincher|first=Chris|date=April 29, 2014|work=The A.V.
