'''Hans Thomas Eriksson''' (born 29 November 1958), known by his stage name '''Orup''', is a Swedish singer, songwriter and musician who enjoyed major success in his native country and Scandinavia in the late 1980s and early 1990s with songs like "[[Jag blir hellre jagad av vargar]]", "[[Regn hos mig]]", "M.B.", "Då står pojkarna på rad", "Magaluf", and "[[Stockholm (song)|Stockholm]]". Orup has also written several songs for other performers. He wrote the winning song of ''[[Melodifestivalen 2004]]'', "[[Det gör ont]]" performed by [[Lena Philipsson]].  He was one of the judges on [[X Factor (Sweden)|X Factor]] in 2012. Orup also took part in season 5 of the Swedish TV-show ''[[Så mycket bättre]]'', broadcast on [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]].

== Early life ==

Orup was born Hans Thomas Eriksson in [[Huddinge Municipality|Huddinge]], Sweden, on 29 November 1958, as the second child of Ann-Marie and Hasse Eriksson; Orup's sister is six years his senior. Eriksson's household was an [[lower middle class]] one.

His parents divorced when he was seven. Orup's father died on 24 July 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.svd.se/pop-karlek-och-ilska|title=Pop, kärlek och ilska|work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|accessdate=14 July 2021}}</ref>

Eriksson received his first guitar and a [[tape recorder]] for his eighth birthday. Orup was introduced to [[the Beatles]] by his sister. Eriksson was into sports, playing ice-hockey for [[Huddinge IK]], as well as football and handball, until his early teens when he formed his first band, a [[Black Sabbath]]-inspired heavy metal band with himself as the lead singer. 

After Orup left school, he worked several temporary jobs as a taxi driver, postman and waiter.

== Career ==

In 1973, when he was 14, Orup formed [[Magnum Bonum]], a band inspired by American [[progressive rock|prog rockers]] [[Styx (band)|Styx]]. At age 16 he wrote his first song, entitled "I Can't Get You Out Of My Mind", for his band MBI, an acronym for, and joint venture of, the two bands Magnum Bonum and Intermezzo.

In the late 1970s Orup grew fond of [[Anglo-American]] [[punk rock]], whose short and intense songs appealed to him and would later become his ethos. He was into British bands [[the Sex Pistols]] and [[the Clash]], and also American groups like [[MC5]], [[the Stooges]] and [[the New York Dolls]]. Although he enjoyed listening to punk, it didn't show in his own songwriting. At this time he also discovered 1960s [[soul music]] and [[Motown]], styles also known for having short and intense songs. Unlike punk, this type of music influenced him heavily, which was evident in his own music from the late 1980s onwards.

After Orup left Magnum Bonum, the band reached number one in the [[Sverigetopplistan|Swedish charts]] in 1978 with "Skateboard", a Swedish-language version of "[[LA Run]]" (an American-sounding single by a British group, the Carvells, that barely grazed the [[UK singles charts]], peaking at 31 in 1977). Orup, in turn, had a first minor hit with "Kom och ta mej" (Come and take me), released by his band Intermezzo in 1979. In the 1980s, he formed and fronted the [[Talking Heads]] and [[Devo]] inspired [[New wave music|new wave]] group Ubangi (1982–1985), and subsequently Thereisnoorchestra (1986–1987). Both bands were co-fronted by [[Cia Soro]].

In 1986 a major-label A&R manager, Leif Käck, came across a demo of Orup's song "Vill du inte ha mina kyssar?" (Don't you want my kisses?) and recorded it with [[Björn Skifs]]. Käck also signed Orup to [[Warner Music|Warners]] as a solo artist. In the summer of 1987 Orup's debut single "Är du redo?" (Are you ready?), a [[go-go]] ditty, was released, reaching number 19 in the charts. In the summer of 1987 Orup was the opening act for the established acts [[Roxette]], [[Eva Dahlgren]] and [[Ratata (band)|Ratata]] on the ''Rock runt riket'' tour.

His big breakthrough came that autumn with the follow-up single "Jag blir hellre jagad av vargar" (I'd rather be chased by wolves), which reached number 4. Orup's eponymous debut album, released in 1988, reached number one, as did the follow up album ''2'' in 1989. Both albums were produced by [[Anders Glenmark]] and contained a string of hit singles.

In 1989 Orup came close second in [[Melodifestivalen 1989|Melodifestivalen]], performing "Upp över min öron" (Up over my ears) as a duet with Anders Glenmark.

Orup's third album, ''Orupean Songs'', released in 1991 was his first (and to date only) album with lyrics in English. It failed to garner any interest in the [[Anglophone]] world, but sold a reasonable 80 000 copies in Sweden, which was nowhere near the success of his first two albums; his previous album had sold a staggering 250 000 copies.

Orup had two big hits in 1992 with "Stockholm", a heavily [[Pet Shop Boys]]-influenced dance track about his hometown, and "Magaluf" about the [[Mallorca]] holiday resort, both lifted from the album ''Stockholm och andra ställen'' (Stockholm and other places).

The summer of 1994 is a fond memory for Swedish sports fans, since Sweden came third in the [[association football|football]] [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. The soundtrack to this event for many Swedes was the official anthem for [[Swedish National Football Team|the national team]] for the campaign, "När vi gräver guld i USA" (When we dig for gold in the USA). Originally the assignment went to [[Niklas Strömstedt]] alone, but his friends Anders Glenmark and the football crazy Orup convinced him to let them co-write the song with him. The three formed a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], [[GES (band)|GES]], an acronym of the trio's last names, and also released an album that year.

Orup released three more albums – Orup 5 (1993), Teddy (1998) and Elva hjärtan (2000). Orup has reported how difficult it was to get airplay for his music during this period. In 2003 GES released a second album, ''Den andra skivan'' (The second album).

In 2004 Orup wrote and produced "Det gör ont" (It hurts) for [[Lena Philipsson]], which won [[Melodifestivalen 2004|Melodifestivalen]] that year and came fifth place in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|Eurovision Song Contest]]. Orup wrote all the songs for Philipsson's 2004 album ''Det gör ont en stund på natten men inget på dan'' (It hurts a while at night but nothing daytime) and wrote or co-wrote all the songs for her follow up album ''Jag ångrar ingenting'' (I regret nothing) in 2005, and their 2008 duet album ''Dubbel'' (Double).

In 2006 and 2010 Orup released solo albums. In 2014 he created the successful show ''Viva la pop'', performing hits from his career, interspersed with humorous monologs, for a dinner audience. In Sweden this format is called ''krogshow'' (roughly: restaurant show).

In 2017 GES played seven nights at [[Borgholm Castle]] in [[Öland]], and in 2018 they went on a summer tour of Sweden, which became the subject of a [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] documentary aired in 2019. For his 60th birthday, in 2018, he performed 35 songs  for three hours and fifteen minutes at [[Globe Arena]], Stockholm.

== Personal life ==

Eriksson married the television presenter [[Sofia Wistam|Sofia Eklöf]] in 1989. The marriage lasted seven years, and they had a son together, Kid (born 1991). Orup is married to patternmaker Pernilla Pettersson. The couple have four children: daughter Charlie (born 2001) and sons Isidor (born 2001), Seth (born 2011) and Ozzy (born 2014). Kid is drummer in rap group [[Tjuvjakt]].

They live in the [[Mariatorget]] district of [[Södermalm]] in Stockholm.

=== Health ===

Orup's music has been largely affected, as he suffers from [[stuttering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressen.se/noje/orup-om-stamningen-hela-livet-forandrades/|title=Orup om stamningen: Hela livet förändrades|work=[[Expressen]]|accessdate=14 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027181008/http://www.gp.se/kulturnoje/1.2527547-orup-gav-fa-svar-i-sa-mycket-battre|title=Orup gav få svar i Så mycket bättre|work=[[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=14 July 2021}}</ref>
