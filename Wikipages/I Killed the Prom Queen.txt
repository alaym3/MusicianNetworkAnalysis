'''I Killed the Prom Queen''' were an Australian [[metalcore]] band from [[Adelaide]], formed in 2000. They were prominent in the Australian live music scene and toured the US, Japan and parts of Europe several times. They issued three studio albums: ''[[When Goodbye Means Forever...]]'' (2003), ''[[Music for the Recently Deceased]]'' (2006) – the latter reached the top&nbsp;30 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]], and most recently ''[[Beloved (I Killed the Prom Queen album)|Beloved]]'' (2014). The band split up in April 2007 due to the inability to find a permanent vocalist. They reformed with vocalist Michael Crafter to play a farewell tour in mid-2008 and released a live album and [[DVD]], ''[[Sleepless Nights and City Lights]]'', which peaked in the top&nbsp;50. In May 2011 the band reformed with new vocalist Jamie Hope and performed on the Destroy Music Tour. They subsequently released their third studio album Beloved in February 2014.

=== Formation and ''Choose to Love, Live or Die'', Stacy's departure (2000–2002)===
I Killed the Prom Queen formed in [[Adelaide]], South Australia in late 2000, with the original line-up featuring Ben Engel on [[bass guitar]], Simon O'Gorman on [[guitar]], JJ Peters (Josef John W.

The band was influenced by late 1990s hardcore bands [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]], [[Converge (band)|Converge]], [[Hatebreed]], and [[Earth Crisis]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[melodic death metal]] groups like [[At the Gates]], [[Soilwork]] and [[In Flames]]. In late 2001 and early 2002, the group recorded the four-track ''[[Choose to Love, Live or Die]]'' EP, which was produced by Paul Degasperi and the band; with additional guitar supplied by Cain Kapetanakis.<ref name="MusAus">{{cite web | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-an24092948 | title = Choose to Love Live or Die | work = [[Music Australia]] | publisher = [[National Library of Australia]] | date = 20 December 2008 | access-date = 21 September 2011 }}</ref> Five songs were recorded during the sessions, but a computer glitch caused the fifth to be erased.

''Choose to Love, Live or Die'' was the only release to include both Lee Stacey's vocals and the higher-pitched vocals by Crafter, as Stacy would depart from the band later that year. The tracks were later re-recorded for their third EP, ''Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You'' (2005).

=== Split CD with Parkway Drive and ''When Goodbye Means Forever'' (2003–2005)===
In March 2003, Rose departed (he later joined [[The Hot Lies]]) and Sean Kennedy took his place. The new lineup then recorded the "Homicide" demo, which appeared on ''Blunt Magazine''<nowiki/>'s ''Harder Core than You'' compilation.<ref name="MusAus1">{{cite web | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-an26932144 | title = Harder Core than You | work = Music Australia | publisher = National Library of Australia | date = 22 April 2005 | access-date = 21 September 2011 }}</ref> While in [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] Crafter saw the first performance by local metalcore band [[Parkway Drive]] and was so impressed that he invited the group to record a [[split album|split CD]] with his band.<ref name="Carver">{{cite video |people= [[Michael Crafter|Crafter, Michael]]|date= 22 September 2009|title= [[Parkway Drive: The DVD]]|medium= DVD |publisher= Fromthegarage.net|time= 8:50 |quote= This was like the first day I came to Byron, so I didn't really expect this band to be good.

In September, the line-up of Cameron, Crafter, Kennedy, Peters and Weinhofen recorded their debut studio album ''[[When Goodbye Means Forever...]]'' for Sydney hardcore label Resist Records, which was released in December.<ref name="MusAus2">{{cite web | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-an25410740 | title = When Goodbye Means Forever | work = Music Australia | publisher = National Library of Australia | date = 4 May 2009 | access-date = 21 September 2011 }}</ref> It was produced by Dan Jones, Anj and the group.<ref name="MusAus2"/> In early 2004, they toured Australia with [[Evergreen Terrace]], Give Up the Ghost, and Boysetsfire.<ref name="Vinall1104"/> The album was released in the US by [[Eulogy Recordings]] in March, and extensive US touring followed.<ref name="Vinall1104">{{Cite news |last= Vinall |first= Sam |date= 3–16 November 2004 |title= I Killed the Prom Queen |magazine= dB&nbsp;Magazine |publisher= Arna Eyers-White |issue= 344 |url= http://www.dbmagazine.com.au/344/iv-IKilledThePromQueen.shtml |access-date= 21 September 2011 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110821210528/http://www.dbmagazine.com.au/344/iv-IKilledThePromQueen.shtml |archive-date= 21 August 2011 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Crafter said that when entering Hawaii, "Three of us got questioned. They were asking us what jails we had been in, what our parents did and what our parents thought of our tattoos".<ref name="Vinall1104"/>

The band spent the coming months supporting [[Caliban (band)|Caliban]], Evergreen Terrace, [[It Dies Today]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], [[Bleeding Through]], [[The Red Chord]], [[Fear Before the March of Flames]], [[Until the End (band)|Until the End]], [[The Warriors (American band)|The Warriors]], [[Between the Buried and Me]], and [[On Broken Wings]] over four months. On March 7, 2005 the band released their third EP, ''Your Past Comes Back to Haunt You.'' The recording featured reworked versions of the band's older songs and "To Be Sleeping While Still Standing". The latter track was written by The Fall of Troy (not to be confused with the US band of the [[The Fall of Troy (band)|same name]]), an earlier band including Crafter and Weinhofen, which only played two shows before breaking up.

=== ''Music for the Recently Deceased'' (2005–2007)===
In August 2005, I Killed the Prom Queen flew to Sweden to record their follow-up album, ''[[Music for the Recently Deceased]]''.<ref name="West0805">{{Cite news |last= West |first= Maddi |date= 10–23 August 2005 |title= I Killed the Prom Queen |magazine= dB&nbsp;Magazine |publisher= Arna Eyers-White |issue= 364 |url= http://www.dbmagazine.com.au/364/iv-IKilledThePromQueen.shtml |access-date= 21 September 2011 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110406151343/http://www.dbmagazine.com.au/364/iv-IKilledThePromQueen.shtml |archive-date= 6 April 2011 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> By late 2005, they had completed recording the album but in January 2006 Crafter was fired. Instead of releasing the album as it was, they decided to recruit a new vocalist and replace Crafter's tracks. They recruited Ed Butcher from UK band The Hunt for Ida Wave. New lyrics were written by Cameron and Butcher, while some lyrics that the whole band had contributed during the Crafter sessions were retained. ''Music for the Recently Deceased'' was produced by [[Fredrik Nordström]],<ref name="West0805"/> whose other credits included [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]], [[At the Gates]] and [[In Flames]],<ref name="AMGNordstöm">{{cite web |url ={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p284491/credits |pure_url=yes}}|title=Frederik Nordström: Credits|access-date=22 September 2010|publisher=Allmusic.

Shortly afterward [[Metal Blade]] released the album in the US, coinciding with the group's appearance at the [[New England Metal and Hardcore Festival]]. Returning to Australia after their third tour of the US in three years, the group toured with [[The Haunted (Swedish band)|The Haunted]] and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and in December, before headlining the [[Metal for the Brain]] festival.

In January 2007 Butcher left the band, which the band attributed to homesickness. After returning to the UK, he fronted UK metalcore band [[Eternal Lord]]. Tyrone Ross from Mourning Tide temporarily filled the vocalist position for a Japanese tour. Colin Jeffs of [[Bendigo]] band Heavenslost then provided vocals on a European tour with Bleeding Through, All Shall Perish and Caliban.

In April, I Killed the Prom Queen announced their breakup, citing both an inability to find a permanent vocalist and Weinhofen's decision to join Bleeding Through. Shortly after a final Australian tour with Crafter on vocals was arranged for the following year. In May 2008, Stomp re-issued ''Music For The Recently Deceased'' in a limited tour edition – of 5,000 hand-numbered copies – for the Say Goodbye Tour. The release included a cardboard slipcase, two live tracks and four tracks with Crafter's vocals taken from the original album recording. The group toured in May and June, with most of the 18 shows selling out. The support acts were [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[The Red Shore]], [[The Ghost Inside (band)|The Ghost Inside]] and local acts from each city. A live album and DVD, ''[[Sleepless Nights and City Lights]]'', was recorded at their Adelaide performance; it was released on 22 November 2008 and peaked in the top&nbsp;50.<ref name="AUSCharts"/> I Killed the Prom Queen played their supposed final show in [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]] on 8 June 2008.

=== Hiatus (2008–2011) ===
After the Say Goodbye tour Crafter formed Melbourne hardcore band [[Confession (band)|Confession]]. He also previously did short stints as the vocalist for [[Carpathian]] and [[Bury Your Dead]] in 2006-2007 and 2007 respectively. He also appeared as a contestant on reality TV show ''[[Big Brother Australia 2008|Big Brother]]'' in 2008. Weinhofen departed Bleeding Through in 2009 and joined [[Bring Me the Horizon]] the same year. He acted as their rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, programmer and backing vocalist until January 2013. He also managed Australian deathcore act The Red Shore. 
Kevin Cameron formed the progressive metalcore band In Trenches with vocalist Ben Coyte. He also acted as a touring musician for several other groups. 
Peters formed and fronted hardcore project [[Deez Nuts (band)|Deez Nuts]] and was one half of the hip-hop duo Grips & Tonic, alongside New Zealand rapper Louie Knuxx. 
Kennedy played bass for Deez Nuts on Australian and international tours.

=== Reformation and ''Beloved'' (2011–2017) ===
In March 2011 I Killed the Prom Queen announced their reunion and an upcoming Australian tour in May with [[The Amity Affliction]], [[Deez Nuts (band)|Deez Nuts]], and [[Of Mice & Men (band)|Of Mice & Men]].<ref name="raw tuneage 1">{{cite web|url=http://rawtuneage.indiestar.tv/2011/03/interview-with-i-killed-prom-queens.html|title=New Interview with I Killed the Prom Queen drummer, JJ Peters|publisher=Raw Tuneage|date=21 March 2011|access-date=4 August 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328123802/http://rawtuneage.indiestar.tv/2011/03/interview-with-i-killed-prom-queens.html|archive-date=28 March 2012}}</ref> Jamie Hope – the original bassist and later vocalist of The Red Shore – joined the band as their new permanent vocalist.

On 21 August 2012, I Killed the Prom Queen released new song "Memento Vivere" on YouTube. The accompanying live footage was taken from the recent European tour. The release was their first new song in six years, and the first song with Hope on vocals.

The band supported Parkway Drive on the Australian and New Zealand legs of the "Atlas Tour" in December 2012. In January 2013, Weinhofen departed Bring Me The Horizon, and shortly after his departure he confirmed that Prom Queen would become a full-time band.

[[File:Jaime Hope I Killed the Prom Queen NSD 2013.JPG|thumb|left|Jamie Hope on the [[Impericon Never Say Die! Tour]] 2013 in [[Cologne]], Germany]]
On 24 March 2013 the band announced on Facebook that JJ Peters had left the band amicably to focus on his other project [[Deez Nuts (band)|Deez Nuts]]. He was replaced by Shane O'Brien, formerly of [[Confession (band)|Confession]] and [[Buried In Verona]]. This made Weinhofen the last remaining original member of the band, although Weinhofen and Cameron were the songwriters for every release since their debut EP.

I Killed the Prom Queen opened for [[Asking Alexandria]] on the "They Don't Pray for Us Tour" and [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]] on their short headline tour in America during spring 2013. This was the band's first time in the country in seven years. An extensive Australian tour was also announced, with [[Buried In Verona]] as the support act. The band also announced dates in Australia and Asia, described as reunion shows with Crafter fronting the band for half the tour and Butcher fronting for the second half, although this was just an April Fools' joke. The band were also due to play four summer dates in New Zealand alongside the Australian tour dates. However the New Zealand dates were cancelled eight days out from the opening show in [[Auckland City]]. They then performed the Never Say Die tour throughout Europe and UK, headlined by [[Emmure]].

In late July 2013 Sean Kennedy announced on his Instagram account that he was no longer a member of the band and would not be featured on the third album. Ben Coyte (ex-Day Of Contempt, Carpathian and current In Trenches vocalist) replaced Kennedy and played his first show with the band at Resurrection Fest 2013.
 
I Killed The Prom Queen announced that they had signed with [[Epitaph Records]] and that the new album ''[[Beloved (I Killed the Prom Queen album)|''Beloved'']]'' would be released in Australia on 14 February 2014 and in the US on 18 February 2014. On 3 December 2013 they released the new single "To the Wolves". A music video for "Thirty One & Sevens" was released on 14 January, followed by a music video for "Bright Enough" on 22 July.

In 2014 Ben Coyte, Kevin Cameron and Jona Weinhofen gained a Lace Pick-ups endorsement.

The band played on the 2015 Vans Warped Tour for all dates.

In August 2017, in an Instagram comment to Weinhofen about the status of I Killed The Prom Queen, he said that playing guitar in a band isn't at the top of his priority list right now.

On 8 August 2018, the group announced they would be reuniting with their 'classic lineup' (featuring Crafter) for a one-off performance at the 2019 [[Unify Gathering]] festival, for the 15th anniversary of their debut album ''[[When Goodbye Means Forever...]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2018/08/08/news/i-killed-the-prom-queen-to-reunite-with-classic-lineup-for-unify-gathering-underoath-taking-back-sunday-etc-also-booked/|title=I Killed The Prom Queen To Reunite With 'Classic Lineup' For 'UNIFY Gathering', Underoath, Taking Back Sunday, Etc.

On February 26, 2021, the band shared a Facebook post from Weinhofen that announced the death of former bassist Sean Kennedy.<ref>{{Cite web|last=I Killed the Prom Queen|title=IKTPQ Facebook post|url=https://www.facebook.com/iktpq/posts/277212790442213|url-status=live|website=Facebook.com}}</ref> Kennedy took his own life on February 24, 2021, at age 35.<ref name="SK">{{cite web |url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/sean-kennedy-former-i-killed-the-prom-queen-bassist-dead-aged-35/ |title=Sean Kennedy, former I Killed the Prom Queen bassist, passes away at 35 |work=Tone Deaf |date=24 February 2021 |access-date=25 February 2021 |author=Lochrie, Conor}}</ref>
