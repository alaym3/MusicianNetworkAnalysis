On March 3, 2009, fifteen [[Westminster College (Missouri)|Westminster College]] students (members of the campus' [[Gay-Straight Alliance]], Black Students Association, International Club, and Cultural Diversity Organization) protested his concert there that evening, due to his use of homophobic and racist terms in performances.<!-- Though Burnham is playing characters in his performances, to make it comedy, that line has to be a thin one. --> Of the controversy, he said, "It's so ironic because [[gay bashing|gay bashers]] were the ones labeling me in high school.{{nbsp}}...
