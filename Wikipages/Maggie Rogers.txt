==Early life==
Maggie Rogers grew up on the Eastern Shore of Maryland along the banks of the [[Miles River]] in [[Easton, Maryland|Easton, Talbot County, Maryland]]. Her father is a now-retired [[Ford Motor Company]] dealer and her mother, a former nurse, is now an end-of-life [[doula]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |last=Pappademas |first=Alex |date=January 17, 2019 |title=Maggie Rogers Went Viral.

Her mother would play neo-soul artists such as [[Erykah Badu]] and [[Lauryn Hill]]. By the time she was in middle school, Rogers had added piano and guitar to her repertoire and began songwriting in eighth grade.<ref name=":5" /> For high school, she attended [[St. Andrew's School (Delaware)|St. Andrew's School]] in [[Middletown, Delaware]] as well as [[The Gunston School]] on the [[Corsica River]] in [[Centreville, Maryland|Centreville, Queen Anne's County, Maryland]]. At school, she played harp in the orchestra, sang in the choir, joined a jazz band, learned banjo and became interested in folk music, and taught herself how to program. She also spent many summers during her formative years at a rural camp in [[Maine]].<ref name=":4" />

The summer after her junior year, Rogers attended a [[Berklee College of Music]] program and won the program's songwriting contest, which spurred her to focus on writing.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=INTERVIEW: Maggie Rogers |url=https://www.thrdcoast.com/read/2016/3/6/interview-maggie-rogers |access-date=July 29, 2019 |website=ThrdCoast |language=en-US}}</ref> During her senior year, she recorded what became her first album, ''The Echo'' (2012). Rogers included her demos as part of her application to [[New York University]]'s [[Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music]].<ref name=":2" /> She secured admission and started in 2012.<ref name=":2" />

=== College years and discovery ===
At NYU, Rogers considered a career in [[music journalism]], and in her first year, Rogers interned for music journalist Lizzy Goodman for whom she transcribed and edited hundreds of hours of interviews with major musicians and journalists, which would be later compiled into Goodman's 2017 book ''[[Meet Me in the Bathroom (book)|Meet Me in the Bathroom]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goodman |first=Lizzy |title=Meet Me in the Bathroom |publisher=Dey Street/HarperCollins |year=2017 |location=New York |pages=595}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last=Romero |first=Cait Munro,Ramona Rosales,Shalev Lavan,Sienree at Celestine Agency,Amy Chance at Celestine Agency,Kaitlyn Darby at Lalaland,Vero |title=Maggie Rogers Didn't Plan On Becoming Famous—Really. |url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/05/233706/maggie-rogers-lyrics-singer-bio-interview |access-date=July 29, 2019 |website=www.refinery29.com |language=en}}</ref>

Rogers released another folk album, ''Blood Ballet'' (2014), during her second year at the school.

Rogers studied abroad in France while at NYU and after friends convinced her to go clubbing while they were in Berlin, her eyes opened to a new genre and she discovered a love for dance music. When she returned home, Rogers was ready to make new music and merge her folk style with electronic production.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 16, 2016 |title=The Shapeshifting Singer-songwriter |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/maggie-rogers-faces-of-2017 |access-date=July 29, 2019 |website=Interview Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2016, after two years of [[writer's block]],<ref name=":3" /> Rogers wrote "[[Alaska (Maggie Rogers song)|Alaska]]", a song she wrote in fifteen minutes about a [[National Outdoor Leadership School]] course. She played the song for [[Pharrell Williams]] in a master class he taught at her school, and a video of a visibly moved Williams listening to the song went viral that June, resulting in millions of views as well as hundreds of thousands of plays of ''The Echo'' and ''Blood Ballet''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Maggie Rogers – Biography – Billboard |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/7393724/maggie-rogers/biography |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |access-date=February 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=From college to a sold-out tour in one year: Maggie Rogers performs in The Current studio |work=Thecurrent.org |url=https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/04/01/from-college-to-a-soldout-tour-in-one-year-maggie-rogers-performs-in-the-current-studio |access-date=November 1, 2018}}</ref>

== Music career ==
After the Pharrell video went viral, several different record labels tried to sign Rogers.<ref name=":2" /> She ended up negotiating a contract with [[Capitol Records]] where "she licenses her music to them through her own imprint, Debay Sounds." As a result, she has more control over her sound and image than many artists at a similar place in their music careers.<ref name=":3" /> [[File:Maggie Rogers @ Grammy Museum 09 15 2019 (49311549131).jpg|thumb|right|Rogers performing in 2019]]Rogers' [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Now That the Light Is Fading]]'', was released on February 17, 2017.

== Personal life ==
Rogers has [[synesthesia]], a benign condition where two or more senses are perceived at once. In her case, she is able to perceive colors as a response to hearing music.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pharrell Williams Masterclass with Students at NYU Clive Davis Institute |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0u7lXy7pDg |access-date=January 19, 2019 |publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

Rogers is currently in graduate school at [[Harvard Divinity School]], where she is "studying the spirituality of public gatherings and the ethics of power in pop culture".<ref>{{Cite tweet |number=1438254903890173966 |user=maggierogers |title=lol i’m in grad school |access-date=September 15, 2021 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Harvard Web Directory |url=https://www.directory.harvard.edu/ |website=www.directory.harvard.edu}}</ref>

=== Activism and philanthropy ===
Her song "Give a Little" was penned on the same day the National School Walkout demanded congressional action on gun control. She was inspired by the activism of students across the nation, and wrote "Give a Little" about empathy and unity.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Horn |first=Olivia |date=July 30, 2018 |title=Listen to "Give a Little" by Maggie Rogers |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/maggie-rogers-give-a-little/ |access-date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>

Rogers also supports organizations like the [[ACLU]] and [[Planned Parenthood]] by donating proceeds from merchandise and shows. In an interview, she said that "Planned Parenthood is something that's really important to me. I am proudly, loudly and distinctly pro-choice. I just don't believe that the government should have a say in what a woman's relationship with her doctor is. But I also just think that I am a woman, and I am an artist, and I'm also a businesswoman, and on stage I'm an athlete. And having access to sexual and reproductive health is key for me running my life. It's important that women all over have access to that, because it also affords them access to opportunities."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Paulson |first=Dave |date=October 10, 2019 |title=Maggie Rogers interview: Playing the Ryman, meeting Dolly and covering John Prine |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/10/maggie-rogers-playing-nashville-meeting-dolly-parton-interview/3820945002/ |access-date=August 18, 2020 |website=[[The Tennessean]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hughes |first=Hilary |date=May 19, 2019 |title=Travis Scott, Maggie Rogers Pledge Merch Proceeds to Planned Parenthood & Yellowhammer Fund After Alabama Abortion Ban |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8512110/travis-scott-maggie-rogers-donate-merch-proceeds-planned-parenthood-yellowhammer-fund-alabama |access-date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>
