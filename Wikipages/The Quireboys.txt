'''The Quireboys''' are an English rock band formed in 1984 in London, with strong ties to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. When the band formed they were originally known as '''The Queerboys''' and later as the '''London Quireboys''' in the United States and Canada, settling at last with their current name.<ref>[http://www.quireboys.com/quireboys_past.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011045005/http://www.quireboys.com/quireboys_past.htm |date=11 October 2007 }}</ref>

The band were successful during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with their debut album ''[[A Bit of What You Fancy]]'' reaching No.&nbsp;2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Their highest charting single in the [[UK Singles Chart]] was with the song "[[Hey You (The Quireboys song)|Hey You]]".

In 1993, the Quireboys broke up but briefly reformed live in 1995 with a new drummer. A more permanent reformation came in 2001 when [[frontman]] [[Spike (musician)|Spike]] and guitarist Guy Griffin put together a new line-up. The band is still active, constantly recording new material and playing live all over the world. Their latest album, ''Amazing Disgrace'', was released on 5 April 2019.

==History==
Vocalist [[Spike (musician)|Jonathan Gray]] (commonly referred to as just 'Spike') moved from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to London when he was 17 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dabelly.com/features/feature101.htm |title=Quireboys |website=Dabelly.com |access-date=23 December 2012}}</ref> Spike met guitarist Guy Bailey in a bar, through his older sister Julie, the two moved in together as flatmates, but did not even discuss playing music until a year later, when a friend brought a guitar round and they began playing [[Chuck Berry]] songs.

By the mid-1980s, the two decided to form a rock and roll band, the name chosen for the group was originally 'The Choirboys' taken from the [[The Choirboys (film)|1977 movie of the same name]], but they soon changed it to the Queerboys.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=359/360}}</ref> Gray and Bailey were joined by bassist Nigel Mogg (nephew of [[UFO (band)|UFO]]'s [[Phil Mogg]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strangers-in-the-night.com/nigelmogg.htm |title=Nigel Mogg |publisher=Strangers-in-the-night.com |date=28 February 2003 |access-date=23 December 2012}}</ref> Chris Johnstone on piano and Paul Hornby, who had previously played drums with The [[Dogs D'Amour]] and with [[Pete Burns]] in the [[Liverpool]] group [[Nightmares in Wax]].

The Queerboys started to build up a following, playing at the [[Marquee Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/22-october-1986-the-queerboys |title=22 October 1986 The Queerboys |publisher=The Marquee Club |date=22 October 1986 |access-date=23 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206155723/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/22-october-1986-the-queerboys |archive-date=6 February 2012  }}</ref> The band's drummer Paul Hornby soon left to join [[Dogs D'Amour]], which contained future friends of the Quireboys, he was replaced by Nick Connell (known as Cozy).<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Connell, Bailey, Johnstone and Mark Sweetmore were old friends, having grown up together and attended Alleynes School in Stone, Staffordshire in the 1970s.

On 28 March 1986, The Queerboys appeared with [[Bernie Torme]] and The Moho Pack at what was Klub Foot at the Clarendon Hotel, [[Hammersmith]]. In May of that year, they played support dates on a Cherry Bombz tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuzzprowlinwolf.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/queerboyspretty-girls-and-babysitters.html |title=Nuzz Prowling Wolf: The Queerboys/Pretty Girls And The Babysitters – Live: Sometime, Somewhere |website=Nuzzprowlinwolf.blogspot.co.uk |date=15 November 2008 |access-date=23 December 2012}}</ref>

By 1987, the band's controversial name was starting to hinder them, it caused some of the gigs on their tour with [[Andy McCoy]]'s band to be cancelled. They were also booked to play [[Reading Festival]], on the understanding that they would change their name. Thus they changed it to the '''Quireboys''' and have kept the name ever since.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> They released two singles via Survival Records, entitled "Mayfair" and "There She Goes Again". Another musician from Newcastle was brought in on rhythm guitar, and [[Ginger (singer)|Ginger]] made his performing debut at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]], where the band were supporting [[Guns N' Roses]]. At the end of 1989, the band released the single "7 O'Clock", which entered the Top 40 of the [[UK Singles Chart]].

[[Sharon Osbourne]] was appointed as manager and The Quireboys were signed to [[EMI]] for the release of their debut album, ''[[A Bit of What You Fancy]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> By 1990, the Quireboys had fired Ginger (who went on to form [[The Wildhearts]]), who they replaced with former Cradle Snatchers / Feline Groove guitarist Guy Griffin.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Griffin has remained with the band ever since, appearing on all their albums and becoming the primary songwriter with Gray. For the debut album, Cozy was substituted by [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]] who played with [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmme.net/interviews/wallace.html |title=Let It Rock – Ian Wallace interview |website=Dmme.net |access-date=23 December 2012}}</ref>

The debut album was produced by [[Jim Cregan]] and George Tutko at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Ron Nevison mixed the album. The band entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at No.&nbsp;2.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> ''A Bit of What You Fancy'' drew positive reviews and was compared favourably to British rock names such as [[Rod Stewart]] and The [[Faces (band)|Faces]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

In support of the debut, the Quireboys toured for the next year. They enlisted American drummer Rudy Richman and played with a variety of bands in different settings in the United States, including [[L.A. Guns]], [[Soundgarden]], [[The Cramps]] and [[Iggy Pop]]. After the tour, they also played some gigs in the United Kingdom; in Spike's hometown of Newcastle where they supported [[The Rolling Stones]] at [[St James' Park]]. Two months after the Stones show, they played in front of 72,000 people at [[Monsters of Rock]] at Donington with [[Whitesnake]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Thunder (band)|Thunder]].

The long touring schedule was finished off with a gig in Japan at the [[Tokyo Dome]] on New Year's Eve in front of 50,000 people. A live album was released following this long touring, entitled ''Live (Recorded Around the World)''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

They began working on the follow-up, ''[[Bitter Sweet & Twisted]]'', which was released in 1993;<ref name="LarkinHR"/> but the birth of [[grunge]] changed the music scene and they were left behind. [[Axl Rose]] asked them to join the "Use Your Illusion Tour" with Guns N' Roses, and they followed the band for a while during their 1993 summer European tour.

The band reformed for a number of concerts in the mid-1990s and found themselves with a loyal following. A new line-up recorded and released ''[[This Is Rock'N'Roll]]'' in 2001 and followed it with the moderately successful ''[[Well Oiled (The Quireboys album)|Well Oiled]]'' in 2004.

On 12 May 2008, The Quireboys released their next album ''[[Homewreckers & Heartbreakers]]'' on the Jerkin Crocus label.  Talking about the inspiration for the new album, Paul Guerin said "It's a funny story.  We were in Malmö, Sweden in the dressing room.  It was just before the show and we'd had a few frothy quenchers.  We were trying to come up with album titles, and everyone was laughing at the suggestions.  A certain member of the band was regaling a story about something he'd done, and another member of the band said "you're just a home wrecker," and someone else said "yeah, and a heartbreaker".  We were just having a laugh, and bang, there it was.  It was as simple as that."<ref>[http://www.komodorock.com/interviews/interviews/komodo-rock-talks-with-paul-guerin-of-the-quireboys-200807316591/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820013409/http://www.komodorock.com/interviews/interviews/komodo-rock-talks-with-paul-guerin-of-the-quireboys-200807316591/ |date=20 August 2008 }}</ref>

In 2010, three members of The Quireboys (Guerin, Griffin and Weir) teamed up with [[Def Leppard]] singer [[Joe Elliott]], to record an album under the name [[Down 'n' Outz]].  Two singles were released, both of which are covers of [[Mott The Hoople]] songs: "England Rocks" (June 2010) and "Overnight Angels" (which reached No. 1 in the US Rock radio chart in January 2011).  Down 'n' Outz  supported [[Paul Rodgers]] on tour in April 2011. They subsequently recorded ''The Further Adventures Of'' and, in 2020, released ''This is How We Roll'', with all original material. The album was awarded Best British Rock album by PlanetRock radio.

In March 2013, The Quireboys played aboard the Monsters of Rock Cruise, along with bands such as [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], [[Kix (band)|Kix]], and [[Queensrÿche]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Monsters-of-Rock-Cruise/144400955629944 |title=Monsters of Rock Cruise |via=Facebook |access-date=23 December 2012}}{{Primary source inline}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Axeman|first=Andrew|title=Monsters Of Rock Cruise 2013 – Hair Metal Mansion's Exclusive Report & Photos|url=http://hairbangersradio.ning.com/forum/topics/monsters-of-rock-cruise-2013-hair-metal-mansion-exclusive|publisher=Hair Metal Mansion|access-date=26 April 2014|date=9 April 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911132916/http://hairbangersradio.ning.com/forum/topics/monsters-of-rock-cruise-2013-hair-metal-mansion-exclusive|archive-date=11 September 2013}}</ref> The band released a new single "Too Much of a Good Thing" on 15 May 2013, taken from their seventh studio album, ''[[Beautiful Curse]]'', which was released a month later in June 2013.<ref name=Quireboys_MULATSCHAG_Blabbermouth_interview>{{cite web|title=Blabbermouth.net interview with MULATSCHAG|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-quireboys-spike-gray-talks-to-austrias-mulatschag-video/|publisher=Blabbermouth|access-date=14 November 2013}}</ref>
