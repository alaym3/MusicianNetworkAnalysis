'''Highasakite''' is an [[indie pop]] and [[indie rock]] band originating from [[Norway]]. The band formed when vocalist and songwriter [[Ingrid Helene Håvik]] met drummer [[Trond Bersu]] whilst studying jazz at the Trondheim Jazz Conservatory. In 2010, after just six months, the duo started working on their debut album. The album ''All That Floats Will Rain'' was released in 2012 via Riot Factory in Norway.  

== Biography ==
Vocalist Ingrid Håvik and drummer [[Trond Bersu]] met while Bersu was studying [[jazz]] at the Trondheim Jazz Conservatory; after starting out as a duo, the two recruited Thomas Dahl, a producer, to help out on bass and guitar, and Øystein Skar joined the group to play synthesizer. After bonding they spent the next six months working on a debut album. Their debut album, ''All That Floats Will Rain'', was released in Norway in February 2012 on the record label Riot Factory, and was produced by Juhani Silvola and Thomas Dahl. The album reached #16 on the Norwegian Albums Chart. After the album's release the band began to play live shows, adding Marte Eberson on synthesizer and Kristoffer Lo on guitar, percussion, flugabone, and tuba to extend their layered instrumentation, and flesh out their sound. Highasakite started out opening for other musical projects like Your Headlights Are On, PELbO and Sacred Harp.<ref name="dagbladet"/> The band later performed at many festivals in 2012, including [[Øyafestivalen]] and the [[Iceland Airwaves]].

The band entered the studio with producer [[Kåre Christoffer Vestrheim]] to record their first full-length album. The album, ''[[Silent Treatment (Highasakite album)|Silent Treatment]]'', was released in February 2014 and reached #1 on the Norwegian Albums Chart.<ref name=tt>{{cite web |first=Thomas |last=Talseth |date=14 February 2014 |url=http://www.vg.no/rampelys/musikk/highasakite-er-aarets-albumvinnere/a/23355934/ |title=Highasakite er årets albumvinnere |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |language=no}}</ref> It was named the second best album of the year by Norwegian music critics in a list published by ''Dagsavisen''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/musikk/her-er-listene-over-den-beste-musikken-i-2014-1.304856 | title=Her er listene over den beste musikken i 2014 | language=Norwegian | first=Espen Hågensen | last=Rusdal | work=[[Dagsavisen]] | date=12 December 2014 | accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> The group toured extensively this year, mostly in Norway.<ref name=tt/> They also toured with the Icelandic band [[Of Monsters and Men]] during their Europe tour.
