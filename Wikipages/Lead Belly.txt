Lead Belly usually played a twelve-string guitar, but he also played the [[piano]], [[mandolin]], [[harmonica]], [[violin]], and [[diatonic accordion|windjammer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Jared|title=Leadbelly and His Windjammer: Examining the African American Button Accordion Tradition|journal=American Music|date=Summer 1994|volume=12|issue=2|pages=148–166|doi=10.2307/3052520|jstor=3052520}}</ref> In some of his recordings, he sang while clapping his hands or stomping his foot.

Lead Belly's songs covered a wide range of genres and topics including [[gospel music]]; [[blues]] about women, liquor, prison life, and racism; and folk songs about cowboys, prison, work, sailors, cattle herding, and dancing. He also wrote songs about people in the news, such as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], the [[Scottsboro Boys]] and [[Howard Hughes]].  Lead Belly was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988 and the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] in 2008.

Though many releases credit him as "Leadbelly", he himself wrote it as "Lead Belly", which is also the spelling on his tombstone<ref name="grave">{{Find a Grave|6121635|Huddie William "Lead Belly" Ledbetter}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deltablues.net/lead3full.jpg |title=Delta Blues.net |access-date=September 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919180227/http://deltablues.net/lead3full.jpg |archive-date=September 19, 2010 }}</ref> and the spelling used by the Lead Belly Foundation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leadbelly.org/re-homepage.html |title=Lead Belly Foundation |publisher=LeadBelly.org |access-date=September 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123193411/http://www.leadbelly.org/re-homepage.html |archive-date=January 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The younger of two children, Lead Belly was born Huddie William Ledbetter to Sallie Brown and Wesley Ledbetter on a plantation near [[Mooringsport, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Laberge|first1=Yves|title=The Blues Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|editor1-last=Komara|editor1-first=Edward|year=2006|pages=586–587|isbn=0-415-92699-8|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=Hwk3AgAAQBAJ|page=586}}}}</ref>   On his [[World War II]] draft registration card in 1942, he gave his birthplace as [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Freeport, Louisiana]] ("Shreveport"). There is uncertainty over his precise date and year of birth. The Lead Belly Foundation gives his birth date as January 20, 1889,<ref>[https://www.leadbelly.org/leadbelly.html "About Lead Belly", ''The Lead Belly Foundation'']. Retrieved 8 March 2020</ref> his grave marker gives the year 1889, and his 1942 draft registration card states January 23, 1889.  However, the [[1900 United States Census]] lists "Hudy Ledbetter" as 12 years old, born January 1888, and the [[1910 United States census|1910]] and [[1930 United States census|1930]] censuses also give his age as corresponding to a birth in 1888. The 1940 census lists his age as 51, with information supplied by wife Martha.  The books ''Blues: A Regional Experience'' by Eagle and LeBlanc and ''Encyclopedia of Louisiana Musicians'' by Tomko give January 23, 1888,<ref name="bare"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Tomko|first=Gene|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZKzDwAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Louisiana Musicians: Jazz, Blues, Cajun, Creole, Zydeco, Swamp Pop, and Gospel|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2020|isbn=9780807169322|location=Baton Rouge|pages=155}}</ref> while the ''Encyclopedia of the Blues'' gives January 20, 1888.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-w-uGwm_LhcC&q=komara+blues+leadbelly+1888&pg=PA586|title=Encyclopedia of the Blues|first=Edward M.|last=Komara|date=March 8, 2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415926997|access-date=March 8, 2021|via=Google Books}}</ref>

His parents had [[Cohabitation|cohabited]] for several years, but they legally married on February 26, 1888. When Huddie was five years old, the family settled in [[Bowie County, Texas]].   The 1910 census of [[Harrison County, Texas]], shows "Hudy Ledbetter" living next door to his parents with his first wife, Aletha "Lethe" Henderson. Aletha is registered as age 19 and married one year. Others say she was 15 when they married in 1908. It was in Texas that Ledbetter received his first instrument, an [[accordion]], from his uncle Terrell. By his early twenties, having fathered at least two children, Ledbetter left home to make his living as a guitarist and occasional laborer.

=== Music career ===
By 1903, Huddie was already a "musicianer",<ref name="wolfe">{{cite book|author1=Wolfe|first=Charles|title=The Life and Legend of Leadbelly|last2=Lornell|first2=Kip|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=1992|isbn=0060168625|location=New York City}}</ref>{{rp|28}} a singer and guitarist of some note. He performed for nearby [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] audiences in St. Paul's Bottoms, a notorious [[red-light district]] there. He began to develop his own style of music after exposure to various musical influences on Shreveport's Fannin Street, a row of saloons, brothels, and dance halls in the Bottoms, now referred to as Ledbetter Heights. Between 1915 and 1939, Ledbetter served several prison and jail terms for a variety of criminal charges. He was "discovered" in prison during a visit by [[folklorist]]s John Lomax and his son Alan Lomax thirty years after his music career started.<ref name=pc18>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19768/m1/|author=Gilliland, John |title=Show 18 – Blowin' in the Wind: Pop Discovers Folk Music. Part 1|publisher=UNT Digital Library, University of North Texas, Digital.library.unt.edu|date=May 18, 1969|work=[[Pop Chronicles]]|access-date=September 22, 2010}}</ref>After one prison release in 1934, the United States was in the [[Great Depression]], and jobs were scarce. In September of that year, in need of regular work in order to avoid cancellation of his release from prison, Lead Belly asked [[John Lomax]] to take him on as a driver. For three months, he assisted the 67-year-old in his folk song collecting around the South. [[Alan Lomax]], his son, was ill and did not accompany him on this trip. While in prison, Lead Belly may have first heard the traditional prison song "[[Midnight Special (song)|Midnight Special]]".<ref>Lomax, Alan, ed. ''Folk Song USA''. New American Library.</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} 

Deeply impressed by Ledbetter's vibrant tenor and extensive repertoire, the Lomaxes recorded him in 1933 on portable [[aluminum disc]] recording equipment for the [[Library of Congress]]. They returned with new and better equipment in July 1934, recording hundreds of his songs. On August 1, Ledbetter was released after having again served nearly all of his minimum sentence, following a petition the Lomaxes had taken to Louisiana Governor [[Oscar K. Allen]] at his urgent request. It was on the other side of a recording of his signature song, "[[Goodnight Irene]]".{{Clarify|Was this a record that on one side was a petition and on the other was his song "Goodnight Irene"?|date=March 2017}}

A prison official later wrote to John Lomax denying that Ledbetter's singing had anything to do with his release from Angola (state prison records confirm he was eligible for early release due to good behavior). However, both Ledbetter and the Lomaxes believed that the record they had taken to the governor had hastened his release from prison.

In December 1934, Lead Belly participated in a "smoker" (group sing) at a [[Modern Language Association]] meeting at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in [[Pennsylvania]], where the senior Lomax had a prior lecturing engagement. He was written up in the press as a convict who had sung his way out of prison. On New Year's Day, 1935, the pair arrived in [[New York City]], where Lomax was scheduled to meet with his publisher, [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]], about a new collection of folk songs. The newspapers were eager to write about the "singing convict", and [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine made one of its first ''[[March of Time]]'' [[newsreel]]s about him. Lead Belly attained fame''—''although not fortune.

On January 23–25, 1935, Lead Belly had the first of several recording sessions with [[American Record Corporation]] (ARC). These sessions, combined with two others on February 5 and March 25, yielded 53 takes. Of those recordings, only six were ever released during Lead Belly's lifetime. ARC decided to simultaneously release these songs on six different labels they owned: Banner, Melotone, Oriole, Perfect, Romeo, and Paramount.<ref name="wolfe" />{{rp|159–60, 292–95}} Unfortunately, these recordings achieved little commercial success. Part of the reason for the poor sales may have been that ARC released only his [[blues]] songs rather than the folk songs for which he would later become better known. Lead Belly continued to struggle financially. Like many performers, what income he made during his career would come from touring, not from record sales. In February 1935, he married his girlfriend, Martha Promise, who came North from Louisiana to join him.

The month of February was spent recording his repertoire and those of other [[African Americans]] and interviews about his life with Alan Lomax for their forthcoming book, ''Negro Folk Songs As Sung by Lead Belly'' (1936). Concert appearances were slow to materialize. In March 1935, Lead Belly accompanied John Lomax on a previously scheduled two-week lecture tour of colleges and universities in the Northeast, culminating at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].

At the end of the month, John Lomax decided he could no longer work with Lead Belly and gave him and Martha money to go back to Louisiana by bus. He gave Martha the money her husband had earned during three months of performing, but in installments, on the pretext Lead Belly would spend it all on drinking if given a lump sum. From Louisiana, Lead Belly successfully sued Lomax for both the full amount and release from his management contract. The quarrel was bitter, with hard feelings on both sides. Curiously, in the midst of the legal wrangling, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax proposing they team up again, but it was not to be. Further, the book about Lead Belly published by the Lomaxes in the fall of the following year proved a commercial failure.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In January 1936, Lead Belly returned to New York on his own, without John Lomax, in an attempted comeback. He performed twice a day at Harlem's [[Apollo Theater]] during the Easter season in a live dramatic recreation of the ''March of Time'' newsreel (itself a recreation) about his prison encounter with John Lomax, where he had worn stripes, though by this time he was no longer associated with Lomax.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine ran a three-page article titled "Lead Belly: Bad Nigger Makes Good Minstrel" in its issue of April 19, 1937. It included a full-page, color (rare in those days) picture of him sitting on grain sacks playing his guitar and singing.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kksEAAAAMBAJ&q=life%20april%2019%2C%201937&pg=PA38 |title=LIFE - Google Boeken |date= April 19, 1937|access-date=December 30, 2011}}</ref> Also included was a striking picture of Martha Promise (identified in the article as his manager) and photos showing Lead Belly's hands playing the guitar (with the caption "these hands once killed a man"), Texas Governor [[Pat M. Neff]], and the "ramshackle" Texas State Penitentiary. The article attributes both of his pardons to his singing of his petitions to the governors, who were so moved that they pardoned him. The text of the article ends with "he... may well be on the brink of a new and prosperous period."

Lead Belly failed to stir the enthusiasm of [[Harlem]] audiences. Instead, he attained success playing at concerts and benefits for an audience of [[folk music]] aficionados. He developed his own style of singing and explaining his repertoire in the context of Southern black culture having learned from his participation in Lomax's college lectures. He was especially successful with his repertoire of children's game songs (as a younger man in Louisiana he had sung regularly at children's birthday parties in the black community). He was written about as a heroic figure by the black novelist [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] in the columns of the ''[[Daily Worker]],'' of which Wright was the Harlem editor. The two men became personal friends, though some say Lead Belly himself was [[apolitical]], and later was a supporter of [[Wendell Willkie]], the [[centrist]] [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] candidate for president, for whom he wrote a campaign song. However, he also wrote the song "Bourgeois Blues", which has radical or left-wing lyrics.

In 1939, Lead Belly returned to prison. Alan Lomax, then 24, took him under his wing and helped raise money for his legal expenses, dropping out of graduate school to do so. After his release, Lead Belly appeared as a regular on Lomax and [[Nicholas Ray]]'s groundbreaking [[CBS]] radio show ''Back Where I Come From'', broadcast nationwide. He also appeared in nightclubs with [[Josh White]], becoming a fixture in New York City's surging folk music scene and befriending the likes of [[Sonny Terry]], [[Brownie McGhee]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and [[Pete Seeger]], all fellow performers on ''Back Where I Come From''. During the first half of the decade, he recorded for the [[Library of Congress]], and [[Moe Asch]] (future founder of [[Folkways Records]]) and in 1944 went to [[California]], where he recorded strong sessions for [[Capitol Records]]. He lodged with a studio guitar player on Merrywood Drive in Laurel Canyon. Lead Belly was the first American country blues musician to achieve success in [[Europe]].<ref name="mudcat"/>

In 1940, Lead Belly recorded for one of the biggest record companies at the time, RCA Victor. These sessions were held on June 15 and 17, with the [[Golden Gate Quartet]] accompanying some songs. The recordings resulted in the album, ''[[The Midnight Special and Other Southern Prison Songs]]'', being issued by [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor Records]], which contained extensive notes and song texts prepared by Alan Lomax. According to Charles Wolfe and Kip Lornell, "it was one of the finest public presentations of Leadbelly's music: well recorded, well advertised, well documented. And the album justified its reputation as a landmark in African American folk music."<ref name="wolfe" />{{Rp|220–22, 298–300}} Several of the recordings from these sessions were also issued as singles by [[Bluebird Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=UC Santa Barbara Library|title=Leadbelly|url=https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/names/102558|access-date=December 5, 2020|website=Discography of American Historical Recordings}}</ref>

In 1941, Lead Belly was introduced to [[Moses Asch|Moses "Moe" Asch]] by mutual friends. Asch owned a recording studio and small record label, which mainly released folk records for the local New York City market.<ref>{{cite book|last=Place|first=Jeff|url=https://folkways-media.si.edu/liner_notes/smithsonian_folkways/SFW40201.pdf|title=Lead Belly: The Smithsonian Folkways Collection|date=2015|publisher=Smithsonian Folkways Recordings|isbn=9780970494252|place=Washington|chapter=The Life and Legacy of Lead Belly|id={{UPC|093074020128}}}}</ref>{{rp|22–23}} Between 1941 and 1944, Lead Belly released three albums under the Asch Recordings label.<ref name="wolfe" />{{rp|225–26, 304–07}}

In 1949, Lead Belly had a regular radio show, ''Folk Songs of America'', broadcast on station WNYC in New York, on [[Henrietta Yurchenco]]'s show on Sunday nights. Later in the year he began his first [[Europe]]an tour with a trip to [[France]], but fell ill before its completion and was diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), or [[Lou Gehrig]]'s disease (a motor neuron disease).<ref name=pc18/> His final concert was at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in a tribute to his former mentor, [[John Lomax]], who had died the previous year. Martha also performed at that concert, singing spirituals with her husband.

Lead Belly died later that year in New York City and was buried in the Shiloh Baptist Church cemetery, in [[Mooringsport, Louisiana]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} west of [[Blanchard, Louisiana|Blanchard]], in Caddo Parish.<ref name="grave" /> He is honored with a statue across from the Caddo Parish Courthouse, in [[Shreveport]].

=== Legal issues ===
[[File:Huddie William Ledbetter in July 1934, from- Angola Prison -- Leadbelly in the foreground (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|right|Lead Belly inside the Angola Prison, July 1934]]
Lead Belly was imprisoned multiple times beginning in 1915 when he was convicted of carrying a pistol and sentenced to time on the Harrison County [[chain gang]]. He later escaped and found work in nearby [[Bowie County, Texas|Bowie County]] under the assumed name of Walter Boyd. Later, in January 1918, he was imprisoned at the Imperial Farm (now [[Central Unit]])<ref name="Perkinson184">Perkinson, Robert (2010). ''Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire''. [[Metropolitan Books]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HOxmcfIopugC&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=Lead+Belly+%22Imperial+Farm%22#v=onepage&q=Lead%20Belly%20%22Imperial%20Farm%22&f=false 184]. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8069-8}}.</ref> in [[Sugar Land, Texas]], after killing one of his relatives, Will Stafford, in a fight over a woman. During his second prison term, another inmate stabbed him in the neck (leaving him with a fearsome scar he subsequently covered with a bandana); Lead Belly nearly killed his attacker with his own knife.<ref name="mudcat"/>

In 1925 he was pardoned and released after writing a song to Governor [[Pat Morris Neff]] seeking his freedom, having served the minimum seven years of a 7-to-35-year sentence. Combined with his good behavior, which included entertaining the guards and fellow prisoners, his appeal to Neff's strong religious beliefs proved sufficient. It was a testament to his persuasive powers, as Neff had run for governor on a pledge not to issue pardons (the only recourse for prisoners, since in most Southern prisons there was no provision for [[parole]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Today in Masonic History |url=https://www.masonrytoday.com/index.php?new_month=11&new_day=26&new_year=2017##targetText=In%201920%2C%20Neff%20defeated%20a,Texas%2C%20there%20was%20no%20parole. |website=MASONRYTODAY.com |access-date=31 October 2019 |date=November 26, 2017}}</ref> After their initial meeting in 1924, Neff came back several times and regularly brought guests to the prison on Sunday picnics to hear Ledbetter perform.<ref name="wolfe" />{{rp|85}}

In 1930, Ledbetter was sentenced to [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] after a summary trial for attempted homicide for stabbing a man in a fight. In 1939, Lead Belly served his final jail term for [[assault]] after stabbing a man in a fight in [[Manhattan]].

===Nicknamed "Lead Belly"===
[[Image:Huddie Ledbetter (Leadbelly) and Martha Promise Ledbetter, Wilton, Conn..jpg|left|thumb|Lead Belly and Martha Promise Ledbetter, [[Wilton, Connecticut]], February 1935]]
There are several conflicting stories about how Ledbetter acquired the nickname "Lead Belly", but he probably acquired it while in prison. Some claim his fellow inmates called him "Lead Belly" as a play on his family name and his physical toughness. Others say he earned the name after being wounded in the stomach with [[buckshot]].<ref name="mudcat">The Mudcat Cafe. [http://www.mudcat.org/huddie.cfm Leadbelly – King of the 12 String Guitar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102033526/http://www.mudcat.org/huddie.cfm |date=January 2, 2016 }} Retrieved on January 30, 2007</ref> Another theory is that the name refers to his ability to drink [[moonshine]], the homemade liquor that Southern farmers, black and white, made to supplement their incomes.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Blues singer [[Big Bill Broonzy]] thought it came from a supposed tendency to lie about as if "with a stomach weighted down by lead" in the shade when the chain gang was supposed to be working.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Terkel | first = Studs | author-link = Studs Terkel | year = 2005 | title = And They All Sang | publisher = New Press}}</ref> Yet another theory is that it may be a corruption of his last name pronounced with a Southern accent.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

==Technique==
Lead Belly styled himself "King of the Twelve-String Guitar", and despite his use of other instruments like the accordion, the most enduring image of Lead Belly as a performer is wielding his unusually large Stella twelve-string.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uniqueguitar.blogspot.com/2009/11/stella-12-string-guitar.html|title=The Unique Guitar Blog: The Stella 12 String Guitar|first=Marcus|last=Ohara|website=Uniqueguitar.blogspot.com|date=November 22, 2009}}</ref> This guitar had a slightly longer [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] than a standard guitar, increasing the tension on the instrument, which, given the added tension of the six extra strings, meant that a trapeze-style tailpiece was needed to help resist bridge lifting. It had slotted tuners and ladder bracing.

Lead Belly played with finger picks much of the time, using a thumb pick to provide walking bass lines described as "tricky" and "inventive"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/lessons/12-string-king-lead-bellys-big-bottom-blues|title=12-String King:Lead Belly's Big-Bottom Blues|first=Dale|last=Turner 2017-02-23T17:39:36Z|website=Guitarworld.com|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref> and occasionally to strum.{{Citation needed|date= October 2012}} This technique, combined with low tunings and heavy strings, gives many of his recordings a piano-like sound. In fact, scholars have suggested much of his guitar playing was inspired equally by [[boogie-woogie|barrelhouse piano]] and the Mexican [[Bajo sexto]], an instrument he encountered in Texas and Louisiana.<ref>Edward M. Komara. ''Encyclopedia of the Blues''. 2006, Psychology Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-w-uGwm_LhcC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&lpg=PA434&dq=lead%20belly%20guitar%20technique&pg=PA434#v=onepage&q=lead%20belly%20guitar%20technique&f=false p. 434]</ref>

Lead Belly's tunings are debated by both modern and contemporary musicians and blues enthusiasts alike {{emdash}} exacerbated by the lack of film footage of his performing rendering chord decoding difficult {{emdash}} but it seems to be a down-tuned variant of standard tuning; it is likely that he tuned his guitar strings relative to one another, so that the actual notes shifted as the strings wore. Such down-tuning was a common technique before the development of [[truss rod]]s, and was intended to prevent the instrument's neck from warping. Lead Belly's playing style was popularized by [[Pete Seeger]], who adopted the twelve-string guitar in the 1950s and released an instructional LP and book using Lead Belly as an exemplar of technique.

In some of the recordings in which Lead Belly accompanied himself, he would make an unusual type of grunt between his verses, sometimes described as "haah!" Songs such as "Looky Looky Yonder", "[[Take This Hammer]]",<ref name=pc18/> "Linin' Track" and "Julie Ann Johnson" feature this unusual vocalization. In "Take This Hammer", Lead Belly explained, "Every time the men say, 'Haah,' the hammer falls. The hammer rings, and we swing, and we sing."<ref>{{YouTube|CJkhdhLndyo|Lead Belly singing "Take This Hammer"}}. Retrieved January 30, 2008.</ref> The "haah" sound can be heard in work chants sung by Southern railroad section workers, "[[gandy dancer]]s", in which it was used to coordinate work crews as they laid and maintained tracks.

==Legacy==
{{Further|List of cover versions of Lead Belly songs}}
In 1976, a biopic titled ''[[Leadbelly (film)|Leadbelly]]'' was released, directed by [[Gordon Parks]] and featuring [[Roger E. Mosley]] as Lead Belly.

[[Kurt Cobain]] promoted the legacy of Lead Belly, and some modern rock audiences owe their familiarity with Lead Belly to Nirvana's performance of "[[In the Pines|Where Did You Sleep Last Night]]" on a televised concert later released as ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmkAk0MgTGg&list=PLE7774393C318DBA4&index=14| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/GmkAk0MgTGg| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Where Did You Sleep Last Night|date=January 10, 2011|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Cobain refers to his attempt to convince [[David Geffen]] to purchase Lead Belly's guitar for him in an interval before the song is played. In his notebooks, Cobain listed Lead Belly's ''Last Session Vol. 1''  as one of the 50 albums most influential in the formation of Nirvana's sound.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=Top 50 by Nirvana |url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/top-50-by-nirvana/ |access-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018034220/http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/top-50-by-nirvana/ |archive-date=October 18, 2014 }}</ref> It was included in ''[[NME|NME's]]'' "The 100 Greatest Albums You've Never Heard list".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/list/100-lost-albums-you-need-to-know-1337 | title=The 100 Greatest Albums You've Never Heard | access-date=11 October 2018 |publisher=[[NME]]}}</ref>

[[Bob Dylan]] credits Lead Belly for getting him into folk music. In his [[Nobel Prize]] Lecture, Dylan said "somebody – somebody I’d never seen before – handed me a Lead Belly record with the song '[[Cotton Fields]]' on it. And that record changed my life right then and there. Transported me into a world I’d never known. It was like an explosion went off. Like I’d been walking in darkness and all of the sudden the darkness was illuminated. It was like somebody laid hands on me. I must have played that record a hundred times."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2016/dylan/lecture/|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2016|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref> Dylan also pays homage to him in "[[Song to Woody]]" on his [[Bob Dylan (album)|self-titled debut album]].

[[Lonnie Donegan]]'s recording of "[[Rock Island Line]]", released as a single in late 1955, signalled the start of the UK [[skiffle]] craze. [[George Harrison]] of [[The Beatles]] was quoted as saying, “if there was no Lead Belly, there would have been no Lonnie Donegan; no Lonnie Donegan, no Beatles. Therefore no Lead Belly, no Beatles.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/incomparable-legacy-of-lead-belly-180954390/|title=The Incomparable Legacy of Lead Belly|first=Roger|last=Catlin|website=Smithsonian}}</ref> In a [[BBC]] tribute in 1999, which marked the 50th anniversary of Lead Belly's death, [[Van Morrison]] — while sitting alongside [[Ronnie Wood]] of [[The Rolling Stones]] — claimed that the British popular music scene of the 1960s wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Lead Belly's influence. “I’d put my money on that,” he said. Wood concurred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/lead-belly-has-inspired-a-music-generation-335558.html|title=Lead Belly has inspired a music generation|date=June 10, 2015|website=Irishexaminer.com}}</ref>

Indian singer [[Bhupen Hazarika]] who was in general influenced by spirituals during his days as a student in the US, transcreated Lead Belly's "We are on the same boat brother" into the [[Assamese language]] as "''Ami ekekhon nawore zatri''" (আমি একেখন নাৱৰে যাত্ৰী).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Majaw|first=Lou|last2=Lyngdoh|first2=Andrew|title=We are in the same boat brother...|work=[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/we-are-in-the-same-boat-brother/cid/349444}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Dutta|first=Pranjal|title=The African American Bhupen Hazarika|work=[[The Sentinel (Guwahati)|The Sentinel]]|url=https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/the-african-american-bhupen-hazarika-509971}}</ref> Later, he also released a [[Bengali language]] version as "''Mora jatri eki toronir''" (মোরা যাত্রী একই তরণীর).<ref>{{Cite web|title=More jatri eki toronir testo|url=http://testicanzoni.mtv.it/testi-Dr.-Bhupen-Hazarika_25705012/testo-Mora-Jatri-Eki-Taranir-63768835|url-status=live|website=MTV Testi Canzoni}}</ref>

In 2001 English-Canadian blues singer [[Long John Baldry]] released his final studio album, ''[[Remembering Leadbelly]]''. It contains cover versions of Lead Belly songs, and features a six-minute [[Alan Lomax]] interview.

[[George Ezra]] developed his singing style from trying to sing like Lead Belly. "On the back of the record, it said his voice was so big, you had to turn your record player down," Ezra says. "I liked the idea of singing with a big voice, so I tried it, and I could."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/09/14/george-ezra-budapest-on-the-verge/14706583/|title=On the Verge: George Ezra arrives by way of 'Budapest'|website=Usatoday.com}}</ref>

In 2015, in celebration of Lead Belly's 125th birthday, several events were held. [[The Kennedy Center]], in collaboration with the [[Grammy Museum]] held ''Lead Belly at 125: A Tribute to an American Songster,'' a musical event featuring [[Robert Plant]], [[Alison Krauss]], and [[Buddy Miller]] with [[Viktor Krauss]] as headliners and [[Dom Flemons]] as host, with special appearances by [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Alvin Youngblood Hart]], [[Billy Hector]], [[Valerie June]], [[Shannon McNally]], [[Josh White Jr.]], and [[Dan Zanes]], among others <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammymuseum.org/programs/lead-belly-at-125-a-tribute-to-an-american-songster|title=Lead Belly at 125: A Tribute to an American Songster &#124; GRAMMY Museum|website=Grammymuseum.org}}</ref> Also in Washington, D.C., ''Bourgeois Town: Lead Belly in Washington DC'' by the [[Library of Congress]] was held where Todd Harvey interviewed Lead Belly family members about their relative, his contributions to American culture and world music and an overview of the significant Lead Belly materials in the center's archive <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/webcast-6854/|title=Bourgeois Town: Lead Belly in Washington DC|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref> In London, England, the [[Royal Albert Hall]] held ''Lead Belly Fest'', a musical event featuring [[Van Morrison]], [[Eric Burdon]], [[Jools Holland]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Paul Jones (singer)|Paul Jones]], and more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/events/2015/lead-belly-fest/|title=Lead Belly Fest &#124; Royal Albert Hall|website=Royal Albert Hall}}</ref>

===The Titanic===
Influenced by the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]'' in April 1912, Ledbetter wrote the song "The Titanic",<ref>{{YouTube|Qe5tcr0yHN4|"The Titanic" by Leadbelly}}</ref> his first composition on the twelve-string guitar, which later became his signature instrument. Initially played when performing with [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] (1893–1929) in and around [[Dallas, Texas]], the song is about champion African-American boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s being denied passage on the ''Titanic''. Johnson had in fact [[Jack Johnson (boxer)#Popular culture|been denied passage on a ship]] for being black, but it was not the ''Titanic''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Swinging the Machine: Modernity, Technology, and African American Culture|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781558493834|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781558493834/page/124 124]|quote=Jack Johnson denied access on Titanic.|author=Dinerstein, Joel|date=April 1, 2003|access-date=November 18, 2011}}</ref> Still, the song includes the lyric "Jack Johnson tried to get on board. The Captain, he says, 'I ain't haulin' no coal!' Fare thee, ''Titanic''! Fare thee well!" Ledbetter later noted he had to leave out this passage when playing in front of white audiences.<ref>''Lead Belly's Last Sessions'', disc 2, track 15, "The Titanic". [[Smithsonian Folkways]].</ref>
