'''Julie London''' (née '''Peck'''; September 26, 1926&nbsp;– October 18, 2000) was an American singer and actress whose career spanned more than 40 years. A [[torch song|torch singer]] noted for her sultry, languid [[contralto]] vocals, London recorded over thirty albums of pop and jazz standards between 1955 and 1969. Her recording of "[[Cry Me a River (1953 song)|Cry Me a River]]", a track she introduced on [[Julie Is Her Name|her debut album]], was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2001. In addition to her musical notice, London was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] in 1974 for her portrayal of nurse Dixie McCall in the television series ''[[Emergency!]]''.

Born in Santa Rosa, California to [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]] parents, London was discovered while working as an elevator operator in downtown Los Angeles, and she began her career as an actress. London's 35-year acting career began in film in 1944, and included roles as the female lead in numerous [[Western film|westerns]], co-starring with [[Rock Hudson]] in ''[[The Fat Man (film)|The Fat Man]]'' (1951), with [[Robert Taylor (American actor)|Robert Taylor]] and [[John Cassavetes]] in ''[[Saddle the Wind]]'' (1958), with [[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Man of the West]]'' (1958) and with [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[The Wonderful Country (film)|The Wonderful Country]]'' (1959).

In the mid-1950s, she signed a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]], marking the beginning of her professional musical career. She released her final studio album in 1969, but achieved continuing success playing the female starring role of nurse Dixie McCall in the television series ''[[Emergency!]]'' (1972–1979), in which she acted with her husband [[Bobby Troup]]. The show was produced by her ex-husband [[Jack Webb]].

==Early life==
London was born Julie Peck{{efn|Though some sources list her birth name as Nancy Peck or Nancy Gayle,{{sfn|Hal Leonard Corporation|2007|p=20}}{{sfn|Owen|2017|p=1}} the [[California Birth Index]] corroborates her birth name as being Julie, listing the birth of Julie Peck on September 26, 1926 in Sonoma County, California, to a Mrs. Taylor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/julie_peck_born_1926_1060274|work=[[California Birth Index]]|title=The Birth of Julie Peck|access-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref> Searches with the California Birth Index for a "Nancy Peck" or "Nancy Gayle" do not return any results for her birth year of 1926.

Throughout her early life, both London and her mother were admirers of [[Billie Holiday]].<ref name=vamp/> London was described by friends and family as a shy child "without much self-confidence".{{sfn|Owen|2017|p=6}} In 1941, when she was 14, her family moved to Hollywood, California. In her teen-aged years, she began to sing in local nightclubs in Los Angeles.<ref name=vamp/> She graduated from the [[Hollywood Professional School]] in 1945 and worked as an elevator operator in downtown Los Angeles throughout high school.{{sfn|Owen|2017|p=8}}

===Discovery and early film roles===
In 1943, London met [[Sue Carol]], a talent agent and then-wife of actor [[Alan Ladd]], while operating the elevator at Roos Bros., ([[Roos/Atkins]]), an upscale clothing store on Hollywood Boulevard.{{sfn|Owen|2017|pages=7–8}} Struck by London's features, Carol facilitated a screen test for the inexperienced actress, and London signed a contract with her. London met ''Esquire'' photographer Henry Waxman while working her second job as a clerk at a menswear store, and he shot photographs of her that appeared in the magazine's November 1943 issue.{{sfn|Owen|2017|p=10}} These photos helped establish her as a [[pin-up girl]] during World War II.{{sfn|Owen|2017|p=11}}

She made her film debut while still in high school, appearing under the name Julie London in ''[[Nabonga]]'' in 1944. She later starred in the 1947 film ''[[The Red House (film)|The Red House]]'' with Edward G. Robinson.{{sfn|Owen|2017|p=11}} After a series of uncredited roles, she signed a contract with [[Warner Bros.

===Mainstream films and music===
After divorcing Webb in 1954, London resumed her career, appearing in ''[[The Fighting Chance (1955 film)|The Fighting Chance]]'', filmed in May 1955 and released by [[20th Century Fox]].{{sfn|Owen|2017|p=49}} Earlier in 1955, London was spotted singing at a jazz club in Los Angeles by record producer [[Simon Waronker]], who was recommended to her by her friend (and future husband) Bobby Troup.{{sfn|Owen|2017|p=42}} Despite her notable stage fright, Waronker was impressed by London's vocals and delivery, and later recalled that "The lyrics poured out of her like a hurt bird."{{sfn|Owen|2017|p=42}} Waronker convinced London to pursue a recording career, and signed her with Liberty Records.{{sfn|Owen|2017|pages=42–7}} London recorded 32 albums{{sfn|Moon|2008|p=454}} in a career that began in 1955 with a live performance at the 881 Club in Los Angeles.{{sfn|McKnight-Trontz|1999|p=77}} Her debut album ''[[Julie Is Her Name]]'' was released in December of that year, and ''Billboard'' named her the most popular female vocalist for 1955, 1956, and 1957. She was the subject of a 1957 ''Life'' cover article in which she was quoted as saying "It's only a thimbleful of a voice, and I have to use it close to the microphone. But it is a kind of oversmoked voice, and it automatically sounds intimate."<ref name="Inc1957">{{cite book|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74|date= February 18, 1957|publisher=Time Inc.|page=74|issn=0024-3019}}</ref>

Music journalist [[Lucy O'Brien]] stated: "[In] the mid-'50s...pop [was] in a period of transition from big band swing to small jazz combos; you've got rock'n'roll, you've got [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]—and she managed to incorporate all those influences and feed that into her music.
