'''G. Love & Special Sauce''' is an American [[alternative hip hop]] band from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=500}}</ref> They are known for their unique, "sloppy", and "laid back" [[blues music|blues]] sound that encompasses classic R&B. The band features [[G. Love|Garrett Dutton]], better known as G. Love, Jeffrey Clemens on drums, and Jim Prescott on bass.<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|pages=166/7}}</ref>

==History==
The band formed in January 1993, when Dutton was performing at a [[Boston]] bar, The Tam O'Shanter.<ref name="Larkin"/> Here he met drummer Jeffrey Clemens. Dutton and Clemens began working as a duo, and were joined a few months later by bassist Jim Prescott,<ref name="Larkin90"/> and became the house band at The Plough and Stars in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. In 1994, they released their [[G. Love and Special Sauce (album)|self-titled debut album]] on [[Okeh Records]].<ref name="Larkin"/> On the strength of the single "Cold Beverage", due in part to the song's rotation on [[MTV]], the album nearly went [[Music recording sales certification|gold]]. Trying to capitalize on the success of the album, the group subsequently toured heavily, eventually landing a spot on the [[H.O.R.D.E.]] tour.

In 1995, they released their follow-up album ''[[Coast to Coast Motel]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> Although it did not sell as well as the first album, it is considered by many critics as the stronger of the two. On tour following the release of the second album, the group nearly broke up, due to disagreements about the group's finances. Deciding on a hiatus the three members went their separate ways, working on various side projects.

By October 1997, the group had reconciled their differences and released their third album, ''[[Yeah, It's That Easy]]'',<ref name="Larkin90"/> which along with their own work, showcased their collaboration with several other bands and musicians, including [[All Fellas Band]], [[Philly Cartel]], King's Court, and [[Dr. John]]. This soul-influenced album was more similar to their debut album than their previous release.

Soon after G. Love & Special Sauce set out on another world tour, returning to Philadelphia in 1999 for the release of their fourth album, ''[[Philadelphonic]]''.<ref name="Larkin90"/> ''Philadelphonic'' was followed up with ''[[Electric Mile]]'' in 2001, an album that shows the wide-ranging influences of the trio, incorporating [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[funk]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelica]], [[blues]], and [[Soul music|soul]] in equal and ambitious measure. Ever the road band, ''Mile'' was followed by extensive touring. During this time they performed as the [[house band]] for [[Comedy Central]]'s show ''Turn Ben Stein On'', which ran from 1999-2001.

In summer 2005, the band featured in an advertisement for the launch of [[Coca-Cola Zero]], featuring the group's own unique version of the noted [[Coca-Cola]] advertising song "[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing]]". On June 24, 2008, ''[[Superhero Brother]]'' was released. On January 15, 2009, G. Love announced on the band's website that [[bassist]] Jimi "Jazz" Prescott is no longer a member of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphonic.com/archives |title=G.

Love posted a release containing the announcement of the album ''Sugar'', and stating that Jimi Prescott had returned to the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphonic.com/news/detail/g._love_special_sauce_to_celebrate_20th_anniversary_with_new_album_reunitin |title=G.
