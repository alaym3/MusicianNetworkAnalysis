Officially, the brothers Charles and Matthew Greywolf had been playing together for years when they decided to create a band, and so Powerwolf was started. Soon the brothers added German drummer Stéfane Funèbre and German keyboardist Falk Maria Schlegel to the band, but could not find a suitable singer to complete the line-up. In the meantime, the band started writing, and on holidays in Romania, Charles and Matthew met Attila Dorn in a [[pub]] in [[Sighișoara]] and invited him to join their band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalblade.com/eu/artists/powerwolf/bio.php |title=Metal Blade Records - Europe |publisher=Metalblade.com |access-date=7 August 2013}}</ref> Dorn, a student of classical [[opera]] at the [[National University of Music Bucharest|National University of Music]] in [[Bucharest]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmb.ro/ |title=UNMB |publisher=Unmb.ro |access-date=7 August 2013}}</ref> moved to the band's hometown [[Saarbrücken]], and became the frontman of Powerwolf. With Dorn's love of Romanian [[werewolf]] legends, the band created their debut album, ''[[Return in Bloodred]]'', which used these same legends as the basis for many of the lyrics. After the album's release, Powerwolf went on their first tour titled Europe in Bloodred Tour.<ref name=":5" />

In 2007, they followed up with their second album, ''[[Lupus Dei]]'', a concept album starring a wolf as the main character and his rise from bloodlust to enlightenment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bioandlyrics.com/powerwolf/biography |title=Powerwolf Biography |publisher=Bioandlyrics.com |access-date=7 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004080633/http://www.bioandlyrics.com/powerwolf/biography |archive-date=4 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalblade.co.uk/index.php?mod=artists&page=interviewdetail&id=51&interviewid=38 |title=Metal Blade Records |publisher=Metalblade.co.uk |access-date=7 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201215352/http://www.metalblade.co.uk/index.php?mod=artists&page=interviewdetail&id=51&interviewid=38 |archive-date=1 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Powerwolf supported [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]] during their tour.<ref name=":6" />

=== 2010–2011: Drummer change and ''Blood of the Saints'' ===
On 2 March 2010 Stéfane Funèbre left the band and was replaced by [[Tom Diener]]. Powerwolf announced it on their [[Myspace]] blog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=10534|title=Powerwolf - Part Ways With Drummer, Replacement Announced - Metal Storm|website=metalstorm.net|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref>

On 28 May 2011 the band announced on their website that Tom Diener was replaced by a new drummer [[Roel van Helden]] from [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.powerwolf.net:80/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629014542/http://www.powerwolf.net:80/|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 June 2011|title=POWERWOLF - Blood of the saints|date=29 June 2011|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref>

The band released the single "[[Sanctified With Dynamite]]" on 24 May 2011 and the second one on 5 July 2011 titled "[[We Drink Your Blood]]", to which Powerwolf recorded their first ever music video. It was shot in an ancient [[monastery]] church. Falk Maria Schlegel commented that "Shooting the video in such a special and atmospheric place was incredible. The combination of the sacral interior of the church, including [[Altar in the Catholic Church|altar]], [[confessional]] box and a [[Organ (music)|church organ]] with a lot of fire, fog and metal insanity was the perfect set for a Powerwolf video."

Their fourth album, titled ''[[Blood of the Saints]]'', was released on 29 July 2011 in [[Europe]] and 2 August in the United States.

In September 2011, Powerwolf went on a quadruple headline tour with [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]], Grave Digger and [[Skull Fist]].<ref name=":9" />

Powerwolf's musical style is different from other power metal bands.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.darkside.ru/interview/515/|title=Interview с Powerwolf|last=Harchenko|first=Arseniy|website=DARKSIDE.ru|access-date=24 August 2019}}</ref> In addition to the classic metal instruments, organ sounds are used. For the studio albums a church choir was recorded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stalker.cd/?lang=2&content=81&id=102|title=Interview: POWERWOLF: The death of the last wild wolf - STALKER MAGAZINE inside out of rock´n´roll|website=stalker.cd|access-date=22 August 2019}}</ref> The band states that their main influences are [[Black Sabbath]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]] and [[Iron Maiden]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerofmetal.dk/interviews/powerwolf.htm|title=Powerwolf Interview|website=powerofmetal.dk|access-date=24 August 2019}}</ref>

The dominant language of the lyrics is English, but they also use Latin ("Werewolves of Armenia", "Lupus Dei", "Kreuzfeuer", "Stossgebet"), and rarely  German  ("Moscow After Dark", "We Take the Church by Storm", "Werewolves of Armenia", "Kreuzfeuer", "Amen & Attack", "Stossgebet", "Glaubenskraft"). The lyrics of the band are characterized by the treatment of Christianity and ancient Romanian legends. Powerwolf, however, do not consider themselves a religious band, but rather call themselves spiritual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studiorock.ro/interviews/interview-with-powerwolf-20/|title=Interview with Powerwolf|date=15 August 2011|publisher=StudioRock}}</ref> When asked if he was a [[Christians|Christian]] or a [[Satanist]], Matthew Greywolf answered: "I am a metalist, a metal fan. Metal is my religion. Look at all these people, what unites them? I can tell you, it's the fucking metal."<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/powerwolf-too-many-bands-take-themselves-too-seriously|title=Powerwolf: "Too many bands take themselves too seriously!"|last=Dare|first=Tom|website=Metal Hammer Magazine|access-date=22 August 2019}}</ref> In one of the interviews, Matthew is quoted saying:<ref name=":13" />

{{Blockquote|text=Some people are confused because we never make a point of saying the silly words of which side we are on. A lot of people ask us, "Are you Satanists? Are you Christians?" And we never say anything about that, and we never will, because in what we do in Powerwolf, it's not important what we as individuals believe or stand for. We sometimes describe religious history, we sometimes write about Satanism, Catholicism, or whatever, but we never judge anything. I think on one side, this is confusing people, but on the other side, a lot of people do understand that we only describe or write lyrics about something, not to deliver a message.|author=|title=|source=}}

=== Live performances ===
Audience engagement, and [[pyrotechnics]] are important parts of Powerwolf's stage show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stage.bravewords.com/galleries/bang-your-head-2018-hungry-like-a-powerwolf|title=Bang Your Head!!! 2018 - Hungry Like A Powerwolf!|last=bravewords.com|website=bravewords.com|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://studiorock.ro/interviews/interview-with-powerwolf-20/|title=Interview with Powerwolf — Interviews — Studio Rock|website=studiorock.ro|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref> The vocalist Attila Dorn often speaks directly to the audience and engages them in various activities, such as singing or shouting, before announcing the next song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bristol247.com/culture/music/review-powerwolf-swx/|title=Review: Powerwolf, SWX|date=22 January 2019|website=Bristol 24/7|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref> The band calls their concerts a "heavy metal mass".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/metal-hammer-uk/20181206/284335430728690|title=PressReader.com - Your favorite newspapers and magazines.|website=pressreader.com|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref> Their stage setup was designed by Matthew Greywolf.<ref name=":4" />
