Formed by Olof Mörck ([[Dragonland]], [[Nightrage]]) and Joacim "Jake E" Lundberg (Dreamland, [[Dream Evil]]) in 2008, the project began taking shape when singers [[Elize Ryd]] (toured with [[Kamelot]]) and Andreas Solveström ([[Cipher System]], Within Y) signed on, as did drummer Morten Løwe Sørensen (The Cleansing, Koldborn, [[Mercenary (band)|Mercenary]]). Bassist Johan Andreassen ([[Engel (band)|Engel]]) joined after the photoshoot for the ''[[Leave Everything Behind]]'' demo but before the recording of the first album ''[[Amaranthe (album)|Amaranthe]]''.
