==History==
The twins Peter and Paul Okoye were born on 18 November 1981 in [[Anambra State]], Nigeria. Their parents are Mrs Josephine Okoye and Pa Moses Okoye. The twin siblings are Jude, Mary, Tony, Lilian and Ifeanyi Okoye.

They later formed an [[a cappella]] quartet called "MMMPP" (M Clef a.k.a. Itemoh, Michael, Melvin, Peter and Paul). Drawing inspiration from their music idol Michael Jackson, they began [[break dancing]], formed the group called "Smooth Criminals" in 1997.<ref name=PSquareOfficial /> They dropped M Clef from the group "MMMPP" which later was changed to "MMPP". Their artistic talent and precise dance routine soon made them household names in the city of Jos, where they performed at school functions and other occasions.<ref name=PSquareOfficial>{{cite web|title=Bio|url=http://mypsquare.com/index.php/default/bio|publisher=PSquareOfficial|access-date=27 July 2013}}</ref>

Later in 1999, Peter and Paul returned to music school to develop their skills on the keyboard, drums, bass and rhythm guitar. Their work includes the soundtracks for a number of films like ''Tobi'', ''Mama Sunday'', ''Moment of Bitterness'' and ''Evas River''.

Later in 1999, they applied to the [[University of Abuja]] to study [[Business administration]]. The Smooth Criminals disbanded when its members left to various other universities. Subsequently, Peter and Paul formed their own group, variously called "Double P", "P&P", and "Da Pees", until they eventually settled on "P Square". They were managed by Bayo Odusami aka Howie T, a seasoned concert promoter and the CEO of Adrot Nigeria Limited.

In 2001, "P-Square" won the "Grab Da Mic" competition, and hence Benson & Hedges sponsored their debut album, titled ''Last Nite'', which was released under Timbuk2 music label. P-Square was also nominated as "Most Promising African Group" in the [[Kora Awards]] three months after the release of their debut album. They eventually won the 2003 Amen Award for "Best R&B Group".<ref name=PSquareOfficial />

In 2005, they released their second album, ''Get Squared'' under their own label, Square Records. This album was marketed nationwide by TJoe Enterprises, although they were still managed by Howie T of Adrot Nigeria Limited. The video for the second album held the No. 1 position on the [[MTV Base]] chart for four straight weeks.

The group performed with artists like [[Ginuwine]], [[Sean Paul]] and  [[Akon]].<ref name=PSquareOfficial />

Late in 2007, they released their best selling album so far, ''[[Game Over (P-Square album)|Game Over]]'', which sold 8 million copies worldwide.<ref name=PSquareOfficial />

In 2009, P-Square released their fourth studio album, ''[[Danger (album)|Danger]]''. The album features collaborations with [[2face Idibia|2 Face Idibia]], J Martins and Frenzy. The first single called "Danger" is a hip hop song with cutting synths and a frog bass baseline similar to an [[Eminem]] song. The video affirms this with the presence of [[clowns]] and staggered movements in front of the camera reminiscent of comical videos by Eminem. They are also known for the close resemblance which the twins have to American R&B singer, [[Usher Raymond]].

On 4 April 2010, P-Square were named the Artist of the Year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/site/list_message/26835|title=P-Square pockets $1m at Kora Awards |publisher=www.africanews.com |date=5 April 2010 |access-date=6 March 2012}}</ref> at the [[Kora Awards]] in [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina-Faso]] while they were in London for a concert at the [[Troxy]], and they will receive a sum of $1 Million Dollars as the award winners, in Ebebiyin City.

On 29 August 2014, P-Square released a single track featuring a top American Artist [[T.I.]] which P-Square titled EjeAjo produced and co-written by VTEK,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viewngr.com/psquare-ft-t-i-ejeajo-mp3-download/|title=PSquare Ft.

On 14 September 2014 P-Square released their 6th studio album titled [[Double Trouble (P-Square album)|Double Trouble]] .<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.afrobios.com/-P+Square/|title=P-Square Discography|work=AFROBIOS|access-date=12 September 2014}}</ref> On 8 October 2015 P-Square were given Range Rover SUVs from [[Globacom]] as Glo Ambassadors for their sponsorship of the #DanceWithPeter TV Radio entertainment programme. The programme brings dancers from around the world to showcase their talents for prizes.

On 24 February 2016 News of how Globacom decided not to renew its Ambassadorship deal with the duo, albeit renewing the contract with other Ambassadors hit the news. This was as a result of a fallout between the company's representatives and Peter, one half of the P-Square twins during the grand finale of the Dance with Peter talent hunt show.<ref>{{cite web|title = Exclusive: Read why GLO stopped Psquare's endorsement deal|url = https://www.naij.com/741460-exclusive-read-why-glo-stopped-psquares-endorsement-deal.html|website = Naij.com – Nigeria news.|access-date = 24 February 2016|language = en-US|first = Michael|last = Okikiola}}</ref>

==Controversy==
The duo were reported to have handled most of their production/beat making in house. The band has been faced with many controversies for their habit of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] western songs and popular hits in their records. They have addressed the issue many times in interviews as well as in the lyrics of their songs. Technically speaking, P Square does more in the line of reconstructing the drum patterns, chord progressions or lyrics of the sampled songs as against actually cutting parts of the song and directly sampling into their production. This accounts for the largely electronic feel of their sound.

Some of the songs which have been called up on this account include "Get Squared", "Game Over", "Danger" and others.

P-Square attracted headlines because they reportedly turned irate when they were notified by organisers in the middle of their performance at the Guinness Show about some change in plans which would affect the length of their performance, and that of the next act, [[2face Idibia|2 Face Idibia]]. As reported by a news site vanguardngr.com, the info apparently stirred up resentment as Peter immediately said "I don’t know why, anytime a foreign artiste comes to Nigeria, they (show organizers) wanna treat us like slaves in our country". Although initially they continued their performance but midway through, they threw their microphones to the ground and angrily stormed out of the stage saying, "We are leaving; they don’t want 2face to come on stage."
They were said to have immediately left the premises of the show, but after intervention of the show organisers, they came on stage later with 2face for a performance, but later on received an apology.

The duo had a difference in opinion regarding what Peter perceived as a lopsidedness in individual input of songs which was getting featured on their joint albums with Paul getting a lion share of his songs selected. This led to Peter refusing to do anything associated with the name "P-Square" for weeks. He later relocated with his wife and kids from the mansion they shared. A lawyer was involved to help split their fortune as they were both involved in joint ventures over the prior years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.360nobs.com/2014/04/the-unbelievable-seperation-in-squareville-full-details-of-the-psquare-split/ |title=The Unbelievable {{sic|Sep|eration|nolink=y}} In SquareVille. Full Details of the Psquare Split |publisher=360 nobs |date= April 2014}}</ref>

The brothers ultimately reconciled publicly on 17th November 2021, when they both hugged and shook hands at Peter Okoye's home in Lagos. Peter's wife and the duo's older brother, Jude Okoye were also present and hugged each other as well.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gistmania.com/talk/topic,523350.0.html |title=Blood is Thicker Than Money -Emotional Moment Peter & Paul Okoye Reunite & Hug Each Other  |publisher=Gistmania |date= November 2021}}</ref>
