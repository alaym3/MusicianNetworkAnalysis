Their fourth studio album ''Antithese'' (2016) ranked 4th on [[Oricon]] chart,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/561163/products/1180179/1/|title=Antithese {{!}} MY FIRST STORY|website=[[Oricon]]|language=Japanese|date=July 11, 2016|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref> and directed their first [[Nippon Budokan]] live show, gathering 12,000.

==History==
=== 2011–2012: Formation and earlier days ===
Having known Hiro through [[Pay Money to My Pain]]'s vocalist K, producer Nori Outani suggested him to Sho in August 2011, when he was still mainly active in his previous band ''Fromus'' together with drummer Masack and bassist Nob. Only a little later, the newly founded formation decided to add another guitarist and Hiro remembered Teru who he had already tried to start a band with in their highschool days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/music/news/63333|title=結成半年MY FIRST STORYがバンド名を冠した初アルバム – 音楽ナタリー|last=Inc.|first=Natasha|website=[[Natalie (website)|Natalie]]|language=ja|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gekirock.com/interview/2016/03/zephyren_my_first_story.php|title=Zephyren代表GEN氏×MY FIRST STORY{{!}} 激ロック インタビュー|last=Department|first=Gekirock Editorial|work=激ロック ラウドロック・ポータル|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref> Their band name "My First Story" had been suggested by [[Pay Money to My Pain|PTP]] vocalist K.

In October 2011, they appeared in a music event sponsored by Sanei Shobo Co., which publishes the street fashion magazine ''Book'' (Ohlie), and performed in public for the first time. In November 2011, they appeared in a music event sponsored by the street fashion brand Subciety (Sub-society).

On April 4, 2012, eight months after the formation, they released their first full album, self-titled ''My First Story'', that by 2013 had already sold 20,000 copies. This work was the first release from the record label Intact Records (established by Core Trust which operates Subciety).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cdjournal.com/main/news/-/42703|title=話題の新星、MY FIRST STORYがデビュー・アルバムをリリース – CDJournal ニュース|website=CDJournal|access-date=2018-04-01|language=ja}}</ref> The music video of the lead song "Second Limit" was directed by Maxilla, a video production team known for [[coldrain]], [[Crossfaith]], and [[SiM (band)|SiM]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/music/news/64929|title=MY FIRST STORY新作リード曲PVで激しいプレイを堪能 – 音楽ナタリー|last=Inc.|first=Natasha|website=[[Natalie (website)|Natalie]]|language=ja|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref> The band's first independent show, “HIGHEST LIFE PARTY Vol. 1”, held in June sold out immediately. On August 19, 2012, they appeared at the [[Summer Sonic Festival]].

=== 2013–2015: Japan tours and ''The Story is My Life'' and ''Kyogen Neurose'' ===
On February 6, 2013, the second album ''The Story is My Life'' released. After the release, the band supported [[All Time Low]] on their Japan tour, followed by their own tour “The Story Is My Life”, which sold out at every venue. They appeared in several music festivals such as [[Punkspring]], [[Rock in Japan Festival]], [[Summer Sonic Festival]], and many more.

The band joined Swanky Dank, Blue Encount and [[Air Swell (band)|Air Swell]], 3 other indie bands, to make a split album project, titled ''Boneds'' in the beginning of 2014. In conjunction with the album release, the 4 bands held a nationwide Boneds tour and an accompanying documentary & DVD of the tour released later that year in April.

On February 5, 2014, the first live DVD ''The End of the Beginning Tour Final Oneman Show at Ebisu Liquidroom'' released. In June, the band held a duo live with [[Nano (singer)|nano]], “HIGHEST LIFE PARTY Vol. 4 & United We Rock On”, who collaborated with the band for her single “Savior of Song”.

On July 16, the second single “Black Rail” released.

On September 24, the third single "Fukyagaku Replace" (不可逆リプレイス, ''Fukagyaku Ripureisu'') released. The song was used as the ending theme for the anime ''[[Nobunaga Concerto]]''.

On October 29, 2014, the band's third album ''Kyogen Neurose'' (虚言Neurose) was released, including the song "Someday" that was written as a tribute song to K who died in December 2012. The album ranked number 14 on the Oricon charts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/561163/products/1100224/1/|title=虚言NEUROSE {{!}} MY FIRST STORY|work=[[Oricon|Oricon News]]|access-date=2018-04-03|language=ja-JP}}</ref> The Itsuwari Neurose tour was held over 2 months, with the final at [[AgeHa|Shinkiba Studio Coast]]. Several shows had to be postponed due to vocalist Hiro and drummer Masack becoming sick with [[influenza]].

In May through June 2015, the band appeared on a tour with fellow Intact Records labelmates, titled “My First Story vs Another Story”.

On May 27, the second live DVD ''Itsuwari Neurose Tour Final at Shinkiba Studio Coast'' released.

On August 5, the fourth single “Alone” released. The single was made in collaboration with Project Hal and used in a TVCM for it.

=== 2015–2016: ''Antithese'' and "We're Just Waiting 4 You" ===
In October 2015, guitarist and leader Sho announced he'd go on hiatus due to personal circumstances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://myfirststory.net/news/article/0/8835|title=MY FIRST STORY OFFICIAL WEB SITE|last=SYSTEM|first=MAG|website=myfirststory.net|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> On December 2, Sho performed in his last oneman show before his hiatus. The live, “We Are Not Alone – Sho Time !!-”, was dedicated to him. During Sho's last performance with the band at Countdown Japan 15/16, vocalist Hiro started to cry as he informed the audience about it being their last 5-men-show before Sho would leave for his hiatus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rockinon.com/quick/cdj1516/detail/136073|title=MY FIRST STORY－最高にラウドな忘年会をぶち上げ、ネクストステージへ|last=株式会社ロッキング・オン|website=[[Rockin'On Japan]]|language=ja-JP|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> Despite his absence onstage with his band members, Sho remains present in My First Story's following albums, credited as composer or sound producer.

In January 2016, the band members all deleted their public Twitter and Instagram accounts before launching their Official Member's Club "Storyteller"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://xxxstorytellerxxx.com/|title=MY FIRST STORY official member's club STORYTELLER|website=MY FIRST STORY official member's club STORYTELLER|language=ja-JP|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> on January 8. As of now, none of the members have reactivated their social media accounts.

On March 3, 2016, the drummer Masack announced withdrawal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://myfirststory.net/news/article/0/8851/|title=MY FIRST STORY OFFICIAL WEB SITE|last=SYSTEM|first=MAG|website=myfirststory.net|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> Kid'z (ex. Shohei) of the band ''Loth'' who broke up in November 2015, joined as a new drummer after he had already been friends with Hiro and Teru. After Sho's suspension of activity and Masack's withdrawal, the first live performance with that new band constellation, "HIGHEST LIFE PARTY Vol. 5" was held at Shibuya O-East on March 10, 2016. There the band announced they would conduct their 47 prefecture one-man tour "We're Just Waiting 4 You Tour 2016" and release their 4th full-length album in summer 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/music/news/179307|title=MY FIRST STORY、47都道府県ツアー初開催 – 音楽ナタリー|last=Inc.|first=Natasha|website=[[Natalie (website)|Natalie]]|language=ja|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref>

On May 4, 2016, they appeared on ''Japan Jam Beach 2016''.

On June 29, 2016, their fourth album ''Antithese'' was released, reaching number 4 on the [[Oricon]] charts which was the band's highest spot on Oricon for an album so far. From June to October 2016 they toured all 47 prefectures of Japan for their "We're Just Waiting 4 You" Tour, and held their tour final at [[Nippon Budokan]] on November 18, 2016, accompanied by the release of the limited single "We're Just Waiting 4 You" that was sold at the venue only. The single included the two songs "We're Just Waiting 4 You", written for Sho who had announced his hiatus in 2015, and "Take My Hand".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rockinon.com/news/detail/148765|title=MY FIRST STORY、武道館公演で会場限定シングルリリース決定！|last=株式会社ロッキング・オン|website=[[Rockin'On Japan]]|language=ja-JP|date=2016-09-20|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> At Budokan, the band performed a setlist consisting of 28 songs in total, including every song from their latest album ''Antithese'', as well as the newly released single "We're Just Waiting 4 You" that they played together with Sho who joined them onstage for encore. Before finishing off their setlist, Hiro announced the last song, "Home", would be performed at Budokan that night for the first and last time.

=== 2017: ''All Lead/Secret Tracks'' and "MMA" ===
The ''We're Just Waiting 4 You Tour 2016 Final at Budokan'' DVD was released on April 12, 2017 and reached number 4 on the Oricon charts.

In February, the first documentary movie ''My First Story Documentary Film -全心-'' screened nationwide through [[Toho|TOHO]] cinemas.

On June 12, 2017, they announced their "MMA" Tour 2017. The tour covered 17 shows from September to November 2017 and would have its final one man show "The Premium Symphony" at [[Makuhari Messe]] on December 23, 2017. The band never clarified what MMA stood for. The tour sold out.

On June 21, 2017, My First Story released their Documentary Film ''―全心― (Zenshin)'' that tells the story of the band from the creation up until Budokan, looking at the evolution and hardships they faced while following them for their "We're Just Waiting 4 You Tour 2016".

On July 19, 2017, the band released their fifth album, ''All Lead Tracks'' that came in 4 different versions: Regular version with 5 tracks, limited version with a bonus track featuring UK from MOROHA, an [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] version that came with an illustration of vocalist Hiro, and the Storyteller version that included a DVD. The album's track "Let It Die" was used for the soundtrack of the eponymous [[PlayStation 4|PS4]] game ''[[Let It Die (video game)|Let It Die]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/260/G026040/20170510044/|title=「LET IT DIE」にロックバンド・MY FIRST STORYがオリジナル楽曲を提供へ。"バルブの塔"の待合室でBGMとして楽しめる予定|last=Inc.|first=Aetas|work=[[4Gamer.net]]|access-date=2018-04-03|language=ja}}</ref> "Reviver" was part of the soundtrack for the ''[[Hortensia Saga|Hortensia Saga: Ao no Kishidan]]'', "Though being the happiest person in this world is something I may not be able to do..." (この世界で一番の幸せ者にはする事など出来ないかもしれないけど..., ''kono sekai de ichiban no shiawase-sha ni suru koto nado dekinai kamoshirenai kedo...'') served as theme song for the Japanese TV-show ''Buzz Rhythm'', "Smash Out!!" was used for ''[[Shinjuku Swan II]]'' and "The Storyteller" was chosen as the theme song for the band's documentary film ''―全心― (Zenshin)''.

In the same year, on December 12, the band released their sixth album entitled ''All Secret Tracks''. The album contains 6 tracks including the [[Cover version|cover]] of "[[See You Again]]" and the song "Overcoming the Night Without You" (君のいない夜を越えて, ''Kimi No Inai Yoru O Koete'') which will be the theme song of ''Ochanomizu Rock''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rockinon.com/news/detail/170735|title=MY FIRST STORY、事前告知なしで新作『ALL SECRET TRACKS』をサプライズ発売|last=株式会社ロッキング・オン|website=[[Rockin'On Japan]]|language=ja-JP|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> Fans guessed that while ''All Lead Tracks'' was named after the fact that every track was used for another project, ''All Secret Tracks'' may have received its name because there had been no release announcements on the part of staff and band, and the CD itself did not come with any song lyrics either.

On December 23, 2017, My First Story held their "MMA" Tour Final "The Premium Symphony" at [[Makuhari Messe]] in front of 18,000 people and performed 23 or their songs together with a live orchestra and choir. Another limited single, “Merry Christmas” was released that day and sold at the venue only. Apart from the title song "Merry Christmas", the CD also included an acoustic version of "Fukagyaku Replace".

=== 2018–2019: ''The Premium Symphony'' and ''S•S•S'' ===
On January 25, 2018, the band announced a new CD titled ''The Premium Symphony''. It will contain eight previously released songs, rearranged with a full orchestra. The CD released March 28, 2018.

On March 16, the band was announced to open for [[Fall Out Boy]]'s [[Mania Tour|MANIA Tour]] in Nippon Budokan, Tokyo on April 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.creativeman.co.jp/artist/2018/04fob/sche.html|title=FALL OUT BOY|website=www.creativeman.co.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref>

On March 23, the DVD of "MMA" TOUR 2017 Final One Man Show "The Premium Symphony" was announced to release on May 23. In addition to the regular DVD, a special [[Virtual reality|VR]] set was sold through WIZY and includes original My First Story VR goggles plus 3 songs specially recorded for VR viewing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wizy.jp/project/82/|title=MY FIRST STORY – MY FIRST STORYをVRでより近くに！臨場感あふれる新たなライブ体験 {{!}}【WIZY（ウィジー）】共創型クラウドクリエイティング WIZY（ウィジー）|work=WIZY（ウィジー）|access-date=2018-04-03|language=ja}}</ref> Another special that came with "The Premium Symphony" was a second DVD including bassist Nob's one man show {{Nihongo|~This is Truly Alone~|〜これがホントのALONEや〜|~Kore ga honto no ALONE ya~}} that was held on March 7, 2018 at Tsutaya O-East, [[Tokyo]]. The limited bundle was only available for pre-order until April 15.

===2019–2020: ''The Plugless'' and ''V'' ===
The band's single "Mukoku", originally scheduled for release on July 31, 2019, was pushed back to August 14 in order to remove the track "Underdog" which featured a collaboration with [[Rize (band)|Rize]] and The Bonez vocalist Jesse who had been arrested for marijuana possession.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jame-world.com/en/news/150803-my-first-story-postpone-release-of-new-single.html|title=MY FIRST STORY Postpone Release of New Single|date=2019-07-22|website=JaME|access-date=2019-09-16}}</ref>
