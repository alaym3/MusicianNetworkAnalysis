'''Ivan Rebroff'''  (31 July 1931{{spaced ndash}}27 February 2008) was a German-born vocalist, allegedly of Russian ancestry,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/18/obituaries.culture|title = Obituary: Ivan Rebroff|date = 18 April 2008}}</ref> who rose to prominence for his distinct and extensive vocal range of four and a half [[octave]]s, ranging from the [[soprano]] to [[bass (voice type)|bass]] registers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3XGAeFx2EiIC&q=Ivan+Rebroff&dq=Ivan+Rebroff&lr=&pgis=1. The Guinness book of records, 1993]</ref>

==Life and career==
Rebroff was born in [[Berlin]] as '''Hans-Rolf Rippert''' to German parents.  His parents were [https://de.rodovid.org/wk/Person:624553 Paul Rippert], an engineer born in 1897 in [[Bad Liebenwerda|Liebenwerda]], and [https://de.rodovid.org/wk/Person:624555 Luise Fenske], born in [[Bydgoszcz]] (then part of Prussian [[Bromberg (region)|Bromberg]]).  He claimed Russian-Jewish descent, and while often disputed, this has never been totally refuted. In a 1989 interview with [[Izvestia]], he said "according to documents I am Ivan Pavlovich Rebroff" ({{lang-ru|Иван Павлович Ребров}}).<ref>[http://russianshanson.info/?id=285&attr=5&art=198 Алимов Г., Чародеев Г. «ИВАН РЕБРОВ «ВСЕЙ ДУШОЙ Я РУССКИЙ» Известия 09.05.1989] [...] По документам я действительно Иван Павлович Ребров. [...]</ref>

He studied singing at the [[Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg]]. Although his knowledge and pronunciation of Russian was imperfect, he became famous for singing Russian [[folk song]]s, but also performed opera, light classics and folk songs from many other countries. He was known on stage for his gusto. He performed over 6,000 concerts in his career, including a two-year seven-day-a-week stint at the French opera, singing and acting, among other greats, the role of Tevye in ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. Rebroff still performed 12 shows in 14 days when he was well into his seventies, such as on an Australian tour.

Ivan Rebroff described himself as international, the "connection between East and West". He became a citizen of Greece and lived on the Greek island of [[Skopelos]] in the [[Sporades]]. Rebroff was homosexual.<ref>[https://www.fnp.de/lokales/hochtaunus/usingen-ort893437/heribert-daume-erzaehlt-mein-freund-ivan-rebroff-10423583.html Frankfurter Neue Presse:Heribert Daume erzählt: Mein Freund Ivan Rebroff (german)], 27 February 2018</ref>

He died in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] after a long illness. Four days after his death, his brother [[Horst Rippert]], who is nine years his senior (and by his own unsubstantiated accounts shot down [[Antoine de Saint Exupéry]] during World War II), claimed part of Rebroff's vast fortune.<ref>[http://www.bild.de/BILD/leute/star-news/2008/03/01/toter-ivan-rebroff/heimlicher-bruder-will-millionen-vermoegen.html "Heimlicher Bruder will Millionen-Vermögen"] (29/2/09) in [http://www.bild.de Aktuelle Nachrichten - Bild.de<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
