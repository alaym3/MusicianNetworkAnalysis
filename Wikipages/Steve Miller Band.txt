The '''Steve Miller Band''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1966 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Steve Miller Band | publisher = Rateyourmusic.com | url = http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/steve_miller_band | access-date = 2008-11-13 }}</ref> The band is led by [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]] on [[guitar]] and lead vocals. The group had a string of mid- to late-1970s hit singles that are staples of [[classic rock]] radio, as well as several earlier [[psychedelic rock]] albums. Miller left his first band to move to San Francisco and form the Steve Miller Blues Band. Shortly after Harvey Kornspan negotiated the band's contract with [[Capitol Records]] in 1967, the band shortened its name to the Steve Miller Band. In February 1968, the band recorded its debut album, ''[[Children of the Future (Steve Miller Band album)|Children of the Future]]''. It went on to produce the albums ''[[Sailor (album)|Sailor]]'', ''[[Brave New World (Steve Miller Band album)|Brave New World]]'', ''[[Your Saving Grace]]'', ''[[Number 5 (Steve Miller Band album)|Number 5]]'', ''[[Rock Love]]'', ''[[Fly Like an Eagle (album)|Fly Like an Eagle]]'', ''[[Book of Dreams]]'', among others. The band's ''[[Greatest Hits 1974–78]]'', released in 1978, sold over 13 million copies. In 2016, Steve Miller was inducted as a solo artist in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==History==
[[Image:Steve Miller Interlochen.jpg|thumb|Steve Miller performing at [[Interlochen Center for the Arts#Interlochen Arts Camp|Interlochen Fine Arts Camp]] on July 20, 2009]]

In 1965, after moving to Chicago to play the [[blues]], Steve Miller and keyboardist [[Barry Goldberg]] founded the Goldberg-Miller Blues Band along with bassist Roy Ruby, rhythm guitarist Craymore Stevens, and drummer Maurice McKinley. The band contracted to [[Epic Records]] and recorded a single, "The Mother Song", which they performed on ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'', before Miller left the group to go to San Francisco.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uy6aKA1rTrEC&pg=PR48-IA23|page=xiviii|title=Crossroads: How the Blues Shaped Rock 'n' Roll|author=John Milward|publisher=UPNE|date= 2013|isbn=9781555537449}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/goldberg-miller-blues-band-1965-66-mw0000593963|work=allmusic.com|author=Lindsay Planer|title=Barry Goldberg / The Goldberg-Miller Blues Band Goldberg-Miller Blues Band 1965-66}}</ref>

Miller then formed The Steve Miller Blues Band. Harvey Kornspan, managing partner, wrote and negotiated the band's contract ($860,000 over five years as well as $25,000 of promotion money that was to be spent at the band's discretion) with Capitol/[[EMI|EMI Records]] then-president [[Alan W. Livingston|Alan Livingston]] in 1967. Shortly after, the band's name was shortened to The Steve Miller Band at the recommendation of [[George Martin]] in order to broaden its appeal. The band, consisting of Miller, guitarist James Cooke, bassist Lonnie Turner, drummer [[Tim Davis (musician)|Tim Davis]] (who replaced the departing Lance Haas on drums) and Jim Peterman on Hammond B3 organ, backed [[Chuck Berry]] at a gig at the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] that was released as the live album, ''[[Live at the Fillmore Auditorium (Chuck Berry album)|Live at Fillmore Auditorium]]''.<ref name="chuckberry">{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckberry.us/wolfgangsvault.html |title=Chuck Berry News |publisher=Chuckberry.us |access-date=2014-08-23}}</ref> Guitarist [[Boz Scaggs]] joined the band soon after and the group performed at the [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival|Magic Mountain Festival]] (festival was held June 10/11, 1967) and the following week at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] (festival was held June 16/17/18, 1967).

In February 1968, while in England, the band recorded their debut album, ''[[Children of the Future (Steve Miller Band album)|Children of the Future]]'', at Olympic studios with [[Glyn Johns]] as engineer/producer. The album did not score among the Top 100 album chart. The second album ''[[Sailor (album)|Sailor]]'' appeared in October 1968 and climbed the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart to {{thinspace|No.| 24}}. Successes included the single "Living in the USA." ''[[Brave New World (Steve Miller Band album)|Brave New World]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 22}}, 1969) featured the songs "Space Cowboy" and "My Dark Hour".  [[Paul McCartney]], credited as "Paul Ramon", played drums, bass and sang backing vocals on "My Dark Hour". This was followed by ''[[Your Saving Grace]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 38}}, 1969) and ''[[Number 5 (Steve Miller Band album)|Number 5]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 23}}, 1970). In 1971, Miller broke his neck in a car accident. Capitol Records released the album ''[[Rock Love]]'', featuring unreleased live performances and studio material. This is one of two Steve Miller Band albums not to be released on CD, the other being ''[[Recall the Beginning...A Journey from Eden]]''. In 1972, the double album compilation ''[[Anthology (Steve Miller Band album)|Anthology]]'' was released, containing 16 songs from the band's first six of seven albums.

The style and personnel of the band changed radically with ''[[The Joker (album)|The Joker]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 1}}, 1973), concentrating on straightforward rock and leaving the psychedelic blues side of the band behind. The title track, "[[The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)|The Joker]]", became a {{thinspace|No.| 1}} single and was certified platinum, reaching over one million sales. It was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on January 11, 1974.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/332 332]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/332}}</ref>

Three years later, the band returned with the album ''[[Fly Like an Eagle (album)|Fly Like an Eagle]]'', which charted at {{thinspace|No.| 3}}. Three singles were released from the album: "[[Take the Money and Run (Steve Miller Band song)|Take the Money and Run]]" ({{thinspace|No.| 11}}), "[[Fly Like an Eagle (song)|Fly Like an Eagle]]" ({{thinspace|No.| 2}}) and their second {{thinspace|No.| 1}} success, "[[Rock'n Me]]". Miller credits the guitar introduction to "Rock'n Me" as a tribute to the [[Free (band)|Free]] song, "[[All Right Now]]".<ref name="gb">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=%22yeah+it%27s+a+tack+on+the+wall+for+Paul%22&pg=PT456 | title=Billboard book of number 1 hits | isbn=9780823076772 | last1=Bronson | first1=Fred | year=2003 }}</ref>

''[[Book of Dreams (Steve Miller Band album)|Book of Dreams]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 2}}, 1977) also included three successes: "[[Jet Airliner (Steve Miller Band song)|Jet Airliner]]" ({{thinspace|No.| 8}}), "[[Jungle Love (Steve Miller Band song)|Jungle Love]]" ({{thinspace|No.| 23}}) (later becoming the song played over the opening credits of the 8th season of the sitcom ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''), and "Swingtown" ({{thinspace|No.| 17}}). 1982's ''[[Abracadabra (Steve Miller Band album)|Abracadabra]]'' album gave Steve Miller his third {{thinspace|No.| 1}} success with [[Abracadabra (Steve Miller Band song)|the title track]].  Miller's hit pushed [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s "[[Hard to Say I'm Sorry]]" out of the {{thinspace|No.| 1}} spot, just as his "Rock'n Me" had knocked Chicago's "[[If You Leave Me Now]]" out of the {{thinspace|No.| 1}} spot in 1976.<ref name="gb"/>

Released in 1978, ''The Steve Miller Band's Greatest Hits 1974–78'' has sold over 13 million copies.<ref name="independentmail.com">{{cite web |author=Jake Grove |url=http://www.independentmail.com/news/2008/oct/15/steve-miller-band-hits-littlejohn-clemson/ |title=The Steve Miller Band hits Littlejohn in Clemson |publisher=Independent Mail |date=2008-10-15 |access-date=2014-08-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116201440/http://www.independentmail.com/news/2008/oct/15/steve-miller-band-hits-littlejohn-clemson/ |archive-date=2014-01-16 }}</ref>
