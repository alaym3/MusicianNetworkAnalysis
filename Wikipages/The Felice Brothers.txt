In August, the band performed at the legendary [[Newport Folk Festival]]. Due to torrential rains, high winds, and lightning storms, power was cut to the entire [[Newport, Rhode Island]] area. As the stage the band was performing on had no generators, the band played unplugged. They performed for over an hour with such songs as "Frankie's Gun!" and a sing-a-long to "[[This Land Is Your Land]]".

=== 2009 ===
The Felice Brothers joined [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], [[Justin Townes Earle]] and the Dave Rawlings Machine for a nine-city package tour called The Big Surprise Tour, after the lead track from the ''Yonder Is the Clock'' album.
