==Career==
===2011–14: Career beginnings, Basement Musik and Shut Up and Vibe series===

Yung Simmie began rapping at a young age before he started recording and releasing songs through his [[SoundCloud]] profile. In December 2011, he released his first body of work as an underground rapper entitled Purple Lady Underground Tape, a mixtape he released as an independent artiste. In early 2012, he was signed to Raider Klan Records. It was under the label he released his first official mixtapes titled G Funk Resurrection 1993–1995: Underground Tape and Tha Undergrxxxd Mixtape: XXL Freshman xf 1993 in February and May 2012 respectively. With production credits from Key Nyata, [[SpaceGhostPurrp]], [[Lil Ugly Mane]], with vocal features from some members of [[Raider Klan]] including long-time friend [[Denzel Curry]]; both mixtapes largely pay tribute to the gangsta-funk genre of hip hop he grew up listening to.

On January 7, 2013, he dropped the first installment of his Basement Musik series. The mixtape included singles like "No More" featuring Chris Travis, "Florida Nigga Mentality (Remix)" featuring SpaceGhostPurrp and "Basement Musik".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2013/01/08/raider-klan-upstart-yung-simmie-releases-basement-musik-mixtape/ |title=Raider Klan upstart Yung Simmie releases Basement Musik mixtape – FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music |publisher=Factmag.com |access-date=May 29, 2017}}</ref> Colin Small of Potholes in My Blog literarily compared the mixtape to [[When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1]], the fourth studio album of [[Three 6 Mafia]]. Rating the mixtape 4 out of 5, he further went on to note that "Basement Musik is a well-crafted synthesis of the neo-Memphis sounds of 2012".<ref>{{cite web|first=Colin|last=Small |url=http://potholesinmyblog.com/album-reviews-yung-simmie-basement-musik/ |title=Yung Simmie – Basement Musik |publisher=Potholesinmyblog.com |date=July 18, 2013 |access-date=May 29, 2017}}</ref> On July 16, he released Shut Up and Vibe Vol. 1, the first installment of his Shut Up and Vibe series.

==Musical style and influences==

As per the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, slow [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]] beats, boastful lyrics, multiple references to [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]], [[alcoholic drink|alcohol]] and [[sexual intercourse|sex]] form the [[leitmotif]]s of Thomas' rap songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/4282227/yung-simmie/biography|title=Yung Simmie – Billboard Biography|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date= April 4, 2017}}</ref> As per the ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' magazine, Thomas, currently during his career, "[...] owned the popular [[cloud rap]] style that was spawned in the South" and "has dominated the underground scene with records like ''Full Metal 2'' and ''Shoot The 3''..."<ref name="vibe"/>

In an interview with ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', Thomas stated that while [[Lil Wayne]] has been his favorite artist, he wished to emulate [[Bob Marley]] to "touch people with my music like he did."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2014/07/the-break-presents-yung-simmie/|title=The Break Presents: Yung Simmie|publisher=XXL|access-date= April 4, 2017}}</ref>
