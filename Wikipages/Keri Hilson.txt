'''Keri Lynn Hilson''' (born December 5, 1982) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She was born and raised in [[Decatur, Georgia]] and spent most of her youth working with producer Anthony Dent as a songwriter and background vocalist for several [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists. By the age of 14, Hilson had secured a record deal with the girl group D'Signe, which later disbanded. She attended [[Oxford College of Emory University]] in Georgia while she continued writing songs for artists including [[Britney Spears]], [[The Pussycat Dolls]], and [[Mary J. Blige]], with the production and songwriting team [[The Clutch]]. In 2006, Hilson signed with American rapper and producer [[Timbaland]]'s record label [[Mosley Music Group|Mosley Music]]. Her breakthrough came in 2007 after appearing on Timbaland's single "[[The Way I Are]]", which topped charts around the world.

Hilson's music style is R&B, hip hop, and [[Pop music|pop]]; womanhood, sexual intimacy, and love are the typical themes. Her musical influences come from her father's side of the family. Hilson's debut studio album, ''[[In a Perfect World...]]'', was released in 2009, and debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, eventually being certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album spawned the hit singles "[[Knock You Down]]" (featuring [[Kanye West]] and [[Ne-Yo]]), "[[Turnin Me On]]" (featuring [[Lil Wayne]]), and "[[I Like (Keri Hilson song)|I Like]]". It also earned Hilson two [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] for "Knock You Down". Her second studio album, ''[[No Boys Allowed]]'', was released in 2010 and was somewhat less successful than its predecessor; however, it did include the platinum single "[[Pretty Girl Rock]]" (featuring Kanye West). As of 2021, Hilson's next album has yet to be released, and for the past eleven years Hilson has not released any new music of her own.

Hilson has also contributed to various charities and pursued a career in acting, and she continues to record and perform music. She has contributed in the fight against [[HIV/AIDS|HIV and AIDS]], helped various relief efforts for natural disasters, and become involved with several educational organizations. In 2012, Hilson made her acting debut in the [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[Think Like a Man]]''. Her achievements include a [[BET Award]], [[MOBO Award]], [[NAACP Image Award]] and two [[Soul Train Music Awards]].
