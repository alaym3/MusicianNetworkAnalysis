In early 1999, after releasing several albums in Spanish, Martin performed "[[The Cup of Life]]" at the [[41st Annual Grammy Awards]] show, which became a catalyst in bringing Latin pop to the forefront of the U.S. music scene.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bcheights.com/2019/05/23/maluma-fifth-album/|title=Maluma Gets Serious On Fourth Studio Album|last=Pollock|first=Brenden|work=[[The Heights (newspaper)|The Heights]]|access-date=August 8, 2021|date=May 30, 2019|archive-date=August 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210808091607/https://www.bcheights.com/2019/05/23/maluma-fifth-album/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9905/17/latin.music/|work=CNN |title=Ricky Martin leading the Latin (music) revolution - May 17, 1999}}</ref> Following its success, Martin released "[[Livin' la Vida Loca]]", which helped him attain success worldwide. It is generally seen as the song that began the [[Latin pop]] explosion of 1999 and made the transition easier for other Spanish-speaking artists to move into the English-speaking market. His first English-language album (titled ''[[Ricky Martin (1999 album)|Ricky Martin]]'') sold 15 million copies and is his best-selling album to date.<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Steve|title=Martin's World View|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA64|date=November 4, 2006|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=64–|id=00062510}}</ref> His other studio albums include ''[[Ricky Martin (1991 album)|Ricky Martin]]'' (1991), ''[[Me Amaras (album)|Me Amaras]]'' (1993), ''[[A Medio Vivir (album)|A Medio Vivir]]'' (1995), ''[[Vuelve (album)|Vuelve]]'' (1998), ''[[Sound Loaded]]'' (2000), ''[[Almas del Silencio]]'' (2003), ''[[Life (Ricky Martin album)|Life]]'' (2005), ''[[Música + Alma + Sexo]]'' (2011), and ''[[A Quien Quiera Escuchar]]'' (2015).

He also acted on stage and TV in [[Mexico]], where he achieved modest fame in the early 1990s. In 1994, he appeared on the US TV soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'' as a Puerto Rican singer.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emmys-flashback-ricky-martin-steamed-up-general-hospital-1994-1130669 | title=Emmys Flashback: Ricky Martin Steamed Up 'General Hospital' in 1994 | access-date=February 15, 2019 |date=April 8, 2019}}</ref> In 2018, he portrayed [[Antonio D'Amico]] in the miniseries ''[[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story]]'', which earned him a nomination for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie]].

==Early life==
Martin was born on December 24, 1971 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], the son of Nereida Morales, an accountant, and Enrique Martín Negroni (son of Enrique Martín and Iraida Negroni Arizmendi),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVJX-4LXN|title=Enrique Martin: Puerto Rico, (Marriage) Civil Registration|website=[[FamilySearch]]|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V683-S2T|title=Iraida Negroni Arizmendi United States Census, 1930|website=[[FamilySearch]]|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> a psychologist.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p29272|pure_url=yes}}|title=Ricky Martin – Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation |access-date=April 8, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Otfinoski138">Otfinoski, 2007. p. 138</ref><ref name="zen">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20133136,00.html|title=Ricky Martin : Zen and Now|work=People|publisher=Time, Inc.|last=Tresniowski|first=Alex|date=December 4, 2000|access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Martin42">Martin, 2010. p. 42</ref> The youngest of three boys on his mother's side and oldest of four children on his father's side, he has four brothers and one sister.

Martin grew up in a [[Roman Catholic]] home and was an [[altar server|altar boy]] throughout his childhood.<ref name="Martin18">Martin, 2010. p. 18</ref> He began singing at age 6, using wooden kitchen spoons as make-believe microphones; he often sang songs by Menudo as well as English-language rock groups such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], and [[REO Speedwagon]].<ref name="Martin16">Martin, 2010. p. 16</ref> His mother's side of the family was musically inclined, and his maternal grandfather was a poet, which inspired young Martin to write songs.<ref name="Martin16"/> Martin later reflected on his time spent with his family as a child: "Every time I find myself in front of an audience, be it twenty people or one hundred thousand, once again I feel the energy that consumed me back at the family gatherings of my youth."<ref name="Martin17">Martin, 2010. p. 17</ref> After discovering, with his father, a newspaper advertisement about auditions for commercials, 9-year-old Martin began appearing in Puerto Rican television commercials for products such as soft drinks, toothpaste, and restaurants.<ref name="Martin2425">Martin, 2010. pp. education24-25</ref> In a year and a half, he starred in 11 commercials.<ref name="Martin2425"/>

After achieving modest fame in Puerto Rico for his work in television commercials, Martin auditioned for membership in the [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] [[boy band]] [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]]. Although the executives enjoyed his dancing and singing at his first two auditions, Martin was rejected because he was too short.<ref name="Martin31">Martin, 2010. p. 31</ref> By the third audition, his persistence impressed executives, and in 1984, 12-year-old Martin became a member.<ref name="Martin3132">Martin, 2010. pp. 31–32</ref> A month after joining Menudo, he made his debut performance with the group at the [[Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center]] in San Juan.<ref name="Martin33">Martin, 2010. p. 33</ref> During this performance, he inadvertently disobeyed the choreography by walking around the stage, when it was planned that he would stay still, and was chastised by the band manager after the show: "The mistake was such a big deal that from that moment on, never again did I move when I wasn't supposed to move. That was the discipline of Menudo: You either did things the way you were told or you were not part of the group."<ref name="Martin3334">Martin, 2010. pp. 33–34</ref> The song "Asignatura Pendiente" from ''[[Almas del Silencio]]'' (2003) was inspired by the first time Martin left Puerto Rico to tour with Menudo.<ref name="Martin47">Martin, 2010. p. 47</ref>

Although Martin enjoyed traveling and performing onstage with Menudo, he found the band's busy schedule and strict management exhausting, and later reflected that the experience "cost" him his childhood.<ref name="Martin28">Martin, 2010. p. 28</ref> He considered leaving the group while on tour in Brazil, but ultimately decided to stay out of fear of media backlash and being sued for breach of contract.<ref name="Martin3637">Martin, 2010. pp. 36–37</ref> Martin also began struggling with his sexuality, noting the stark contrast between his status as a [[sex symbol]] and his own emotions.<ref name=VH1behindthemusic>(2002) ''[[Behind the Music]]'': Ricky Martin episode. [[VH1]].</ref> Despite this, Martin acknowledged his "opportunity to have so many amazing experiences with so many amazing people" during his time with the group.<ref name="Martin37">Martin, 2010. p. 37</ref>

He developed an interest in philanthropy when the group became [[UNICEF]] ambassadors, often working with impoverished children in third world countries.<ref name="Martin37"/> His experiences as an ambassador affected him greatly and inspired him to continue working with charities later in life.<ref name="Martin37"/>

By 1987, Menudo's record sales began to decline, and the group changed its image, adopting an edgier look and performing more rock-influenced songs.<ref name="Martin44">Martin, 2010. p. 44</ref> The band released the album ''[[Somos Los Hijos del Rock]]'' in Spanish, and to appeal to their Filipino fanbase, the group released ''[[In Action (Menudo album)|In Action]]'', recording songs in both English and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].<ref name="Martin44"/>

After recording 11 albums with the group, Martin left Menudo in July 1989, at age 17, hoping to rest and evaluate his career path.<ref name="Martin46">Martin, 2010. p. 46</ref> He performed his final show with the group at the same venue where he had performed his first performance as a member.<ref name="Martin46"/> Martin returned to Puerto Rico to graduate from high school, and 13 days after turning 18, he moved to New York City to celebrate his financial independence (since he was a minor during his time with Menudo, Martin was not allowed to access his own bank accounts).<ref name="Martin58">Martin, 2010. p. 58</ref> He was accepted into [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], but months before classes began, Martin dropped out and moved to [[Mexico City]] to perform in the play ''Mama Ama el Rock'' (''Mom Loves Rock'').<ref name="Martin1819">Martin, 2010, pp. 18–19</ref>

===1991–1994: Acting and first two solo albums===
While he was performing onstage in ''Mama Ama el Rock'', a producer in the audience took notice of Martin's acting and offered him a role in the Mexican [[telenovela]] ''[[Alcanzar una estrella]]'' after the show.<ref name="Martin66">Martin, 2010. p. 66</ref> He also joined the cast for the second season of the show, titled ''[[Alcanzar una estrella II]]''.<ref name="Martin66"/> A film based on the TV series, titled ''Más que alcanzar una estrella'', was also produced in which Martin starred and in 1993 earned an El Heraldo Award for his role.<ref name="Martin67">Martin, 2010. p. 67</ref> The show centered around a fictional musical group called [[Muñecos de Papel]], in which Martin played Pablo Loredo, one of the six members; the group toured several cities in Mexico and recorded two albums.<ref name="Martin66"/> Although he had hoped to take a break from touring after Menudo, Martin enjoyed the experience as he got along well with the other members.<ref name="Martin67"/>

In 1990, Martin was signed to [[Sony Music Latin|Sony Discos]], [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s Latin imprint. Eager to make his first solo album, Martin signed the contract without reading it and inadvertently signed a deal in which he would only be awarded one cent of royalties for each album sold.<ref name="Martin70"/> Despite viewing the contract as unfair, Martin referred to the record as "the start of something phenomenal" for him.<ref name="Martin70"/> After working "around the clock" to finish filming ''Alcanzar una estrella II'' and recording music, Martin released his debut solo album, the Spanish-language ''[[Ricky Martin (1991 album)|Ricky Martin]]'', in November 1991.<ref name="Martin7071">Martin, 2010, pp. 70–71</ref> ''Ricky Martin'' included the singles "[[Fuego Contra Fuego]]" and "[[El Amor de Mi Vida (song)|El Amor de Mi Vida]]". "Fuego Contra Fuego" was certified Gold in Mexico, Argentina, Puerto Rico, and the United States.<ref name="Martin71">Martin, 2010. p. 71</ref> To promote the album, Martin toured throughout Latin America, which the singer referred to as "an indescribable feeling, almost like coming home."<ref name="Martin71"/>

After the success of ''Ricky Martin'' and its subsequent tour, Martin's record company met him with acclaimed producer Juan Carlos Calderón on his second solo album ''[[Me Amaras (album)|Me Amaras]]''. Although Martin felt "very grateful" for the opportunity to work with Calderón, he noted, "I always felt that that record was more his than mine."<ref name="Martin87">Martin, 2010, p. 87</ref> Released in May 1993, ''Me Amaras'' features a Spanish-language cover of the [[Laura Branigan]] song "[[Self Control (Raf song)|Self Control]]", titled "[[Self Control (Raf song)#Ricky Martin version|Que Dia Es Hoy]]".<ref name="MeamarasAM">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/me-amar%C3%A1s-mw0000100600|title=Review: Ricky Martin – Me Amaras|last=Henderson|first=Alex|work=AllMusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation |access-date=July 10, 2012}}</ref> In his review, Alex Henderson of [[AllMusic]] wrote, "The CD isn't without its pleasures{{nbsp}}... but on the whole, ''Me Amaras'' is too glossy, too calculated, and much too contrived for its own good."<ref name="MeamarasAM"/>

In 1994, Martin's agent encouraged him to move to Los Angeles to act in an American sitcom called ''[[Getting By]]''.<ref name="Martin76">Martin, 2010. p. 76</ref> The show was canceled after two seasons, but soon afterward, Martin was given the role of singer/bartender Miguel Morez on the soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]''.<ref name="Martin7778">Martin, 2010, pp. 77–78</ref> Martin felt he lacked chemistry with the rest of the ''General Hospital'' cast and observed that people treated him differently because of his Puerto Rican accent.<ref name="Martin7879">Martin, 2010, pp. 78–79</ref> At the time, it was relatively uncommon for Hispanic people to appear on American television, and people suggested that he take accent reduction classes, which he refused.<ref name="Martin7778"/> It was during this time, however, that Martin began his first committed relationship with a man.<ref name="Martin81">Martin, 2010. p. 81</ref> He "stopped fearing his sexuality", and soon [[Coming out|came out]] to his mother, who was supportive of him.<ref name="Martin81"/> However, after the relationship ended, Martin "locked [his] feelings even deeper inside", and began dating women again.<ref name="Martin82">Martin, 2010. p. 82</ref> He recalled, "I already felt it was hard to be a Latino in Hollywood; what could have been more difficult than being Latino and gay?"<ref name="Martin84">Martin, 2010. p. 84</ref>

===1995–1998: ''A Medio Vivir'', ''Vuelve'', and breakthrough===
In 1995, Martin refocused on his music career, and began work on his third album, ''[[A Medio Vivir (album)|A Medio Vivir]]''. The first single, the ballad "[[Te Extraño, Te Olvido, Te Amo]]", written by the producer of [[Lynda Thomas]], Carlos Lara, was reminiscent of his earlier work.<ref name="Martin102">Martin, 2010. p. 102</ref> With the song, Martin furthered his expansion from Latin American and Spanish-speaking audiences to the European and Asian markets.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r224606|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic]</ref> However, the record also made a shift from his traditional ballad-style compositions to a more risky fusion of music centered around traditional Latin sounds, epitomized by the song "[[María (Ricky Martin song)|Maria]]".

After the success of "Livin' la Vida Loca", Martin's personal life became a subject of interest due to his large gay following, and he was questioned about his sexual orientation. In a December 2000 interview with ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'', he was asked to comment on the rumors surrounding his sexuality.

"I know that I like both men and women, I'm against sexual labels, we are simply human beings with emotional and sexual needs," he stated in an interview with the Mexican magazine ''Fama!'' He added that "I am gay, men fascinate me, but I like to enjoy sex in total freedom, so I'm open to having sex with a woman if I feel desire."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/people/2016/1/19/ricky-martin-open-sex-women-doesnt-call-himself-bi |title=Ricky Martin 'Open' to Sex With Women, But Doesn't Call Himself Bi |date=January 19, 2016 |publisher=The Advocate |access-date=October 14, 2018}}</ref>

Martin recalled being on his [[Livin' la Vida Loca Tour]] during an appearance on ''Proud Radio'' on [[Apple Music]] in July 2020, stating: "My music was being heard all over the world, regardless of the language, I could high five God, but I wasn't living to the fullest.

I need to forgive myself for allowing myself to reach this level, to get to where I'm at.' And I took some time and I took a sabbatical." After taking time off to learn about himself and his sexuality, Martin still was not ready to publicly come out — his friends and family knew, but other people still did not. Only until he began working on his memoir, ''Me'', did he finally summon the courage to publicly come out to his fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/ricky-martin-gay-comung-out-1234704837| title=Ricky Martin on the Moment He Decided to Come Out as Gay: 'I've Been Super Happy Ever Since'| access-date=July 18, 2020 |date=July 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://people.com/music/ricky-martin-says-he-wasnt-living-to-the-fullest-before-coming-out-been-super-happy-ever-since| title=Ricky Martin 'Wasn't Living to the Fullest' Before Coming Out: 'Been Super Happy Ever Since'| access-date=July 18, 2020 |date=July 14, 2020}}</ref>

Martin's coming out was a game-changer for Latin Pride as he was the first mainstream Latin music artist to come out. ''Billboard'' wrote that "with Martin's announcement, gay artists, who had long kept their sexual identities a secret, finally had a beacon of hope. If Martin could come out with his career unscathed, there was hope for other artists in Latin music to start doing the same." Since that, a growing number of Latin stars have also come out after years in the spotlight, or many have simply started their careers without hiding their sexual identities.<ref name="Pride Billboard">{{cite news| url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/columns/latin/8515756/latin-pride-lgbtq-artists-ricky-martin-javiera-mena| title=Latin Pride: From Ricky Martin to Javiera Mena, 15 Latin LGBTQ Artists Who Have Defined the Movement| access-date=July 18, 2020 |date=June 4, 2020}}</ref>

Martin has expressed support for [[same-sex marriage]] in an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]''.<ref name="LK_Live">{{cite web|url = http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/6110/Let_Ricky_Martin_get_married|title = Let Ricky Martin Get Married!|publisher = samesame.com.au|author = Akersten, M.|date = November 11, 2010|access-date = November 14, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101113135622/http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/6110/Let_Ricky_Martin_get_married|archive-date = November 13, 2010|df = mdy-all}}</ref> He delivered a speech at the United Nations Homophobia Conference on November 12, 2012.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/ricky-martin-united-nations-i-lived-in-fear_n_2284350.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Ricky Martin to United Nations: 'I Lived In Fear' | date=December 12, 2012}}</ref>

On March 5, 2016, Martin met with Chilean LGBT rights group Fundación Iguales to learn about the challenges LGBT citizens face there. "I want equal marriage rights for Chile," he said at the meeting and added that he wants his sons to grow up in a world where "there are no second-class citizens."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latinpost.com/articles/117759/20160307/ricky-martin-unites-with-chilean-activists-for-lgbt-rights-in-the-latin-american-country.htm| title=Latin Pride: From Ricky Martin to Javiera Mena, 15 Latin LGBTQ Artists Who Have Defined the Movement| access-date=July 18, 2020 |date=March 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.efe.com/efe/english/entertainment/ricky-martin-stands-up-for-same-sex-marriage-in-chile/50000264-2859522| title=Ricky Martin stands up for same-sex marriage in Chile| access-date=July 18, 2020 |date=March 6, 2016}}</ref>

When Colombia's highest court voted against a proposal that said marriage only applied to unions between men and women in April 2016, Martin tweeted: "Love and equality win, Colombia says YES to same-sex marriage."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.billboard.com/index.php/articles/columns/latin/7326432/ricky-martin-juanes-react-colombia-same-sex-marriage| title=Ricky Martin, Juanes & More React to Colombia's Ruling in Favor of Same-Sex Marriage| access-date=October 19, 2020 |date=April 8, 2016}}</ref>

In February 2018, in an interview with E. Alex Jung of Vulture, Martin discussed working on ''[[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story]]'' as [[Antonio D'Amico]] and how he wanted his portrayal to help normalize open relationships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/ricky-martin-on-american-crime-story-versace-and-coming-out.html|title=Ricky Martin on ACS: Versace, Coming Out, and 'Normalizing' Open Relationships|publisher=Vulture|date=February 14, 2018|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>

On June 2019, Martin published an open letter slamming the "religious liberty bill", a bill that allowed government employees to avoid serving certain constituents, saying: "As a defender of human rights and a member of the LGBTT community, I am vehemently opposed to the proposed measure imposed upon us under the guise of religious freedom, that projects us to the world as a backwards country." Puerto Rico's governor backed down and withdrew his support of the bill after Martin's statement.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ricky-martin-slams-religious-liberty-bill-puerto-rico-governor-backs-n1017246| title=Ricky Martin slams 'religious liberty' bill.
