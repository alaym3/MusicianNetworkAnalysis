==History==
===Formation and early years===
The three Bivona brothers met [[Aimee Allen]], a solo artist at the time, in 2009 while touring with their band Telacasters supporting [[The Dirty Heads]] and [[Sugar Ray]]. In 2011, Aimee and Kevin started writing songs together and brought Kevin's brothers, twins Jesse and Justin, in to play drums and bass. That led to the four forming The Interrupters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI0GG7Oese8|title=Soundproof: The Interrupters|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=February 17, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>
