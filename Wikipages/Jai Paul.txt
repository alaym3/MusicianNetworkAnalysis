'''Jai Paul''' is an English songwriter, record producer and recording artist from [[Rayners Lane]] in [[Greater London]], England. His early demo "[[BTSTU]]", posted on [[Myspace]], led to his discovery and a recording contract with [[XL Recordings]]. Together with its follow-up "[[Jasmine (Jai Paul song)|Jasmine]]", these songs have been influential on underground as well as mainstream pop music in the 2010s.<ref name="Dazed">{{cite web |title=How Jai Paul changed the sound of pop with just two songs |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/37374/1/how-jai-paul-changed-the-sound-of-pop-with-just-two-songs |website=[[Dazed]] |date=12 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="Noisey">{{cite news |last1=Bassil |first1=Ryan |last2=Jones |first2=Daisy |title=How Jai Paul's Influence Has Spread Beyond Simple Rip-Offs |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev3xae/how-jai-pauls-influence-has-spread-beyond-simple-rip-offs |work=[[Noisey]] |date=19 November 2018}}</ref> A collection of his songs was leaked in 2013 uploaded by an unknown source, to acclaim of some critics, and then Paul did not release any new music for six years. Paul returned in 2019 with the official release of his leaked album entitled ''[[Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones)]]'', and a new double single entitled "Do You Love Her / He".

==Early life==
Paul is from [[Rayners Lane]] in [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], northwest [[London]], [[England]]. He is of [[British Indian|Indian descent]].<ref name="Dazed"/> Among many musical peers, Paul was also high school friends with small-time emo-pop artist and YouTuber Sauly Bee.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX21mqiI0pA</ref>

Paul's 2007 demo recording "[[BTSTU]]", hosted at his [[Myspace|MySpace]] page, received widespread music blog coverage throughout 2010, resulting in UK national radio play. International music press followed blog coverage of the track (with some publications shortening the song's title to "BTSU").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2010/04/06/jai-paul-btsu-mp3|title=Jai Paul, "BTSU" MP3|website=The FADER|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hypebeast.com/2010/4/jai-paul-btsu|title=Jai Paul - BTSU|work=HYPEBEAST|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The song caught the attention of several record companies and a bidding war ensued, with Paul eventually signing with [[XL Recordings]] later that year.<ref>[http://www.chrysalismusic.co.uk/news/new-signing-jai-paul/ ''New Signing – Jai Paul''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219085842/http://www.chrysalismusic.co.uk/news/new-signing-jai-paul/|date=19 December 2010}}, ''Chrysalis Music News''.

===2013–2016: Leaked material, hiatus from music===
On 14 April 2013 an unknown user uploaded a number of untitled tracks to [[Bandcamp]], a music streaming and purchasing service that caters mainly for independent artists (artists without a record label). These untitled tracks were made available for sale as an album. Bandcamp is known for being vulnerable to scams and copyright infringement, with ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' reporting in a feature that "Its response time to infractions is slow, and its built-in protections against scams appear minimal."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/10/the-brief-and-bizarre-life-of-the-fake-amazon-bandcamp-page/|title=The Brief and Bizarre Life of the Fake Amazon Bandcamp Page|first=Sasha|last=Geffen|date=2015-10-28|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> However, hours after the page's appearance, music press picked up on it and publicised it extensively, reporting the music as belonging to Paul and describing it as constituting his debut album, as well as including links to download the material in articles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/80920/listen-jai-paul-releases-long-awaited-debut-album|title=Listen: Jai Paul releases long-awaited debut album {{!}} Gigwise|last=Baggs|first=Michael|website=gigwise.com|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref><ref name="thefader.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/04/13/download-jai-pauls-self-titled-debut-lp|title=Download Jai Paul's Self-Titled Debut LP|website=The Fader|first=Duncan|last=Cooper|date=13 April 2013|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> Paul and his record label denied having released the recordings, or authorising their release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jai_paul/status/323775821561090049|title=To confirm: demos on bandcamp were not uploaded by me, this is not my debut album.

Myers however also reported the music as having come from a personal laptop stolen from Paul himself, citing a comment made by Twitter user "@FatAmpNadia" as his source.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/owen_myers/status/323769373439442945|title=Jai Paul had his laptop stolen, there will be a statement at 3pm according to @FatAmpNadia|last=Myers|first=Owen|date=2013-04-15|website=@owen_myers|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> Major music press followed Myers' lead, and the stolen laptop story was universally reported.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2013/04/report-jai-pauls-album-leaked-from-stolen-laptop/|title=Jai Paul's album leaked from stolen laptop|date=2013-04-15|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref> It is unclear how "@FatAmpNadia" is involved.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crackintheroad.com/music/21107-feature-finding-jai-paul|title=Feature: How I 'Found' 'Jai Paul' And What We Know Now |date=2013-04-14|work=Crack in the Road|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>

Many journalists and commenters suggested the leak to be a cynically devised marketing plan on Paul and XL Recordings’ behalf; having achieved the desired result, the two parties made false statements to the public ‘explaining away’ the events. Others conjectured that Paul did in fact upload the tracks himself, in an attempt to illegally leak and sell his music independently from record label XL Recordings and publisher BMG, seeing parallels with distinct situations involving unrelated artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/search//|title=Gigwise|website=gigwise.com|access-date=2017-08-07}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Duncan Cooper of ''The Fader'' concludes that "In any case, the album's origins and officialness (sic) seem like something of a technicality", adding the opinion that "Jai Paul seems to be getting paid for it", despite the record company's claims otherwise.<ref name="thefader.com"/>

Many publications opted to review the leaked material as an "album" with ''Gigwise'' commenting "there are moments that sound distinctly unfinished. There are periods of silence at the end of most tracks, there're only a few smooth segues between the skits and the tracks, and there are periods where the mixing of the vocal track sounds downright bad. The whole album doesn't feel as precisely balanced as you would expect from Jai Paul."

Despite being an unofficial release, the "album" was ranked in year-end lists, at number 32 in the music blog Pretty Much Amazing's "40 Best Albums of 2013",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prettymuchamazing.com/feature/best-albums-2013 |title=PMA's 40 Best Albums of 2013 |publisher=Pretty Much Amazing|date=18 October 2013 |access-date=11 June 2013}}</ref> number 28 in ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s "Best Albums of 2013",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/dec/05/best-albums-2013-30-to-21 |title=Best albums of 2013: 30–21 |newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 December 2013|access-date=8 December 2013}}</ref> and number 20 in [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']]'s "Top 50 Albums of 2013".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9293-the-top-50-albums-of-2013/4/|title=Pitchfork – The Top 50 Albums of 2013 |website=Pitchfork|date=18 December 2013|access-date=18 December 2013}}</ref> In August 2014, ''Pitchfork'' recognised the leak in its "The 100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far" list.<ref>{{cite web|date=19 August 2014|title=The 100 Best Albums of the Decade So Far (2010-2014)|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9465-the-top-100-albums-of-2010-2014|access-date=25 October 2014|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> Formal release of the leaked material, ''[[Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones)]]'' (2019), was ranked number 95 in the publication's 200 Best albums of the 2010s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|date=2019-10-08|title=The 200 Best Albums of the 2010s|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-albums-of-the-2010s/|url-status=live|access-date=2019-10-08|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>

===2016–2019: Paul Institute===
In March 2016, Jai and his brother [[A. K. Paul]] announced a new project titled Paul Institute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jai Paul and Brother A.K.

In November 2017, Jai was pictured for the first time since 2013 in ''[[Property Week]]'', in which himself and A. K. Paul had signed a lease in London's [[White City Place]] for a space for the Paul Institute.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.propertyweek.com/news/paul-institute-finds-home-at-white-city-place/5093537.article|title=Paul Institute finds home at White City Place|work=Property Week|first= David|last= Parsley|date= 15 November 2017|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref> Later that month, Paul Institute released two new singles; "Mystery", by Fabiana Palladino, with production credits to Jai Paul, and "Evil", by Ruthven, with production credits to A. K. Paul.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/fabiana-ruthven-mystery-evil/|title="Mystery"/"Evil" by Fabiana Palladino / Ruthven Review |website=Pitchfork|first=Philip|last=Sherburne|date=17 November 2017|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref>

On 25 July 2018, The Institute released two new singles: the track "Shimmer" by Fabiana Palladino featuring Jai Paul on production, engineering, instrumental and mixing duties; and "Hypothalamus", Ruthven's second release on the Paul Institute imprint, featuring A. K. Paul on guitar.

===2019–present: Return from hiatus and release of leaked material===
In 2019, the leak was made official and digitally available as ''[[Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones)]]'' to his website and streaming services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jai-paul.com/|title=Jai-Paul.com|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> The download included a long letter by Paul where he writes about how the music probably got leaked: "I don't really know. I believe these particular versions of tracks may have come from a burned CD that got misplaced - a fair amount of people would have had access to my music in various forms between 2010 and 2013."<ref name="p4knew2019">{{cite web|last=Bloom|first=Madison|date=1 June 2019|title=Jai Paul Returns With 2 New Songs, Officially Drops 2013 Leaked Album: Listen|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/jai-paul-returns-with-2-new-songs-listen/|access-date=4 June 2019|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> In the same letter, Paul also addresses the speculation about leaking the music himself: 'I was also frustrated by how all this was being framed online, leading to the widespread belief that I had decided to leak my own music, despite my record label and I saying otherwise. It didn't fit at all with anything I had done previously in style or attitude, and especially not in presentation."

He also released two new singles, "He" and "Do You Love Her Now", as a double [[b-side]] to the ''Bait Ones'' album. This marked Paul's return from a hiatus of more than seven years after the release of his last single, "Jasmine".<ref name="p4knew2019" /> Paul provided miscellaneous production to the [[Childish Gambino]]'s track "[[Time (Childish Gambino song)|Time]]" featuring [[Ariana Grande]] on the album ''[[3.15.20]]'', released in March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/81088/Childish-Gambino-03.15.20/|title=Review: Childish Gambino - 03.15.20|website=[[Sputnikmusic]]|date=March 30, 2020|author=Rowan5215|access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>

On April 20, 2021, Paul posted on [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]] in honor of the ten year anniversary of his first single, "BTSTU."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CN6OX5jj3YN/ |website=www.instagram.com}}</ref> In his posts he linked fans to a new site, a recreation of his old [[MySpace]] account, the platform he originally released music on. The site featured some unreleased demo and promotional material, as well as Easter Egg content that linked to videos and websites.

==Relationship with media and industry==
Music media has speculated about Paul's background, motivation and intent as he has remained out of the public eye, and his professional music career has not followed convention thus far. English publication ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' noted Paul's distinctiveness early on, saying in 2011: "Hype is a fascinating commodity. Where some quickly melt down the attention for liquid purpose, promising talent Jai Paul removed all his music from [[MySpace]] and went to get his shit together".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/electronic-talents-5-jai-paul  |title=Electronic Talents #5: Jai Paul |publisher=Clash Music |date=26 May 2011 |access-date=12 June 2012}}</ref> XL Recordings founder and owner [[Richard Russell (XL Recordings)|Richard Russell]] accepts Paul's idiosyncratic style, saying: "Jai is a wizard... the way he's going about things is, I think for many, baffling. He's going about things in the most Jai Paul way you could possibly go about things. And who knows where that may lead."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/npr/154527302/a-record-label-with-a-midas-touch |title=New Music: A Record Label With The Midas Touch |first=Jacob|last=Ganz|publisher=NPR |date=8 June 2012 |access-date=8 June 2012}}</ref>

''Guardian'' writer Michael Cragg, having met Paul in 2011, observes that Paul's enigma "seems genuinely uncontrived – Jai just doesn't seem into the idea of rushing or teasing new material if it isn't ready."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/02/jai-paul-jasmine-demo |title=New music: Jai Paul – Jasmine (demo)  |first=Michael|last=Cragg|newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 April 2012}}</ref> In a separate piece for ''i-D'', Cragg goes on to say: "there was something incredibly charming about his confusion as to why anyone would want to talk to him. Weirdly, he was under the impression he could just release music for people to enjoy and that would be that."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/why-staying-silent-is-fast-becoming-the-secret-to-superstardom |title=why staying silent is fast becoming the secret to superstardom |first=Michael|last=Cragg |publisher=i-d.vice.com |date=21 November 2016}}</ref> ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s Lindsay Zoladz suggests that Paul may be "perhaps more burdened by his talent than inclined to show it off."<ref name="Peculiar Case" /> Meanwhile, ''Quietus'' blogger Alex Macpherson disagrees, presuming the opposite; saying Paul's "career to date [consists] of little more than a couple of shonky demos and a carefully cultivated aura of mystique" in a scathing article titled "Jai Paul: A Scam To Feed The Internet Sausage Machine".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/12022-jai-paul-album-farce-bandcamp |title=Jai Paul: A Scam To Feed The Internet Sausage Machine  |first=Alex|last=Macpherson|publisher=thequietus.com |date=19 April 2013}}</ref>

More recently, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine asked singer [[Nao (singer)|Nao]] (who has collaborated with A. K. Paul) whether the Paul brothers' image was intentionally "mysterious". She answered in the negative, saying: "They're not tapped into the industry in that way and I don't know if they give a shit." She added: "They're normal guys that are trying to find their own route without playing the game."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/meet-nao-avant-rb-star-moves-from-back-up-singer-shadows-w431476 |title=Meet Nao, Avant-R&B Star Moving From Back-Up Singer Shadows |work=Rolling Stone |first=Andy|last=Beta|date=29 July 2016}}</ref>
