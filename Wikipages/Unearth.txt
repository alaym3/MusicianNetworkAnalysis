'''Unearth''' is an American [[metalcore]] band from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Formed in 1998, the group has released seven studio albums.

==History==
===Early career (1998&ndash;2002)===
Unearth was formed by Trevor Phipps, Buz McGrath, Ken Susi, Mike Rudberg, and Chris Rybicki in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] in 1998. The band began as Point 04 (containing McGrath, Rudberg, and Rybicki), and Susi was recruited soon afterwards. The band attempted to recruit Phipps while he recovered from [[appendicitis]], but Phipps was reluctant to join. However, when Phipps showed up to a jam session for one of Susi's side bands, Unearth was practicing instead, and Phipps agreed to join after hearing the song "Shattered by the Sun." The name "Unearth" was coined by drummer Mike Rudberg as he wanted the band to "Unearth" a new sound in the metal and hardcore world. On the small independent label, Endless Fight Records, they released their first [[extended play|EP]] called ''[[Above the Fall of Man]]'' in May 1999. Unearth then signed to [[Eulogy Recordings]] to release ''[[The Stings of Conscience]]'' in 2001 and the ''[[Endless (Unearth album)|Endless]]'' EP in 2002. During the process of ''Endless'', Chris Rybicki left the group and was first replaced by former [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]] bassist Andrew Abramowitz. After Abramowitz left, John Maggard came in.

===''The Oncoming Storm'' (2003&ndash;2005)===
After playing tours and festivals like the [[New England Metal and Hardcore Festival]] with Unearth, Mike Rudberg departed from the group days after their performance at The [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in 2003, having performed the show in the nude.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features/sep2006/unearth.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127042432/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features/sep2006/unearth.aspx|url-status=dead|title=Decibel Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=January 27, 2007}}</ref> Also Buz McGrath left for personal problems but came back shortly after. The rest of Unearth would then use Tim Mycek of [[Sworn Enemy]] as temporary replacement drummer and Kia Eshghi of Rumi on guitar. Before Buz returned, Mike Martin from [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]] also filled in for him. After Buz's return, Adam D from [[Killswitch Engage]] also filled in on drums for the last two months of the year.

With Buz McGrath and new permanent drummer Mike Justian, of [[The Red Chord]] and previously [[post-hardcore]] band Hassan I Sabbah, Unearth released ''[[The Oncoming Storm]]'' through [[Metal Blade Records]] on June 29, 2004. That summer, they played at [[Ozzfest]] and would later begin touring with [[Killswitch Engage]], [[Shadows Fall]], and [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] for [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' United States tour. They would also tour with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] the next year. In 2005, Unearth performed in the first ever [[Sounds of the Underground]] tour with numerous bands like [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]], [[Gwar]], and [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]].

===''III: In the Eyes of Fire'' (2006&ndash;2008)===
[[file:Unearth in 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Unearth in 2006]]
In early 2006, they began writing their next album. After the writing process, they recorded ''[[III: In the Eyes of Fire]]'' with well-known heavy metal producer [[Terry Date]] at [[Seattle]]. This latest coup was yet another landmark in their blossoming career, a fact the band were quick to acknowledge:  "Working with Terry Date is another amazing feat for us on a growing list of accomplishments".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalcentre.com/webzine.php?p=promotions&nr=122&PHPSESSID=970b|title=METAL CENTRE Webzine: News, Gallery, Reviews, Interviews etc. - 09/28/2007|website=Metalcentre.com |archive-date=28 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042612/http://www.metalcentre.com/webzine.php?p=promotions&nr=122&PHPSESSID=970b |access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref>{{Citation not found|date=December 2014}} As they finished their latest album, they performed at [[Ozzfest]] for the second time, including songs from the album even though it was not destined for release until August 8, 2006. During the release, they began their headlined Sanctity of Brothers tour with [[Bleeding Through]], [[Animosity (band)|Animosity]], [[Through the Eyes of the Dead]] and [[Terror (band)|Terror]]. After participating in Japan's Loud Park festival, Unearth and [[Slayer]] toured together all around the U.S. in early 2007 on the Christ Illusion tour. They headlined a European tour in the beginning of 2007 with [[Job for a Cowboy]], [[Despised Icon]], and [[DÅÅTH]].  Which was followed by a U.S. & Canadian tour with [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[DevilDriver]] and [[Kataklysm]] that began in the middle of April. It was during this tour that [[drummer]] Mike Justian was fired from the band for numerous reasons.  To fill in for the rest of the tour, [[Gene Hoglan]] of [[Strapping Young Lad]] was recruited. They played in the [[Download Festival#Download 2007|2007 Download Festival]] with Seemless/Kingdom of Sorrow/studio drummer [[Derek Kerswill]] who has since joined the band officially.

The band's live DVD ''[[Alive from the Apocalypse]]'' was released on March 18, 2008, and debuted at No. 13 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top Music Video Chart, with sales around 1,800. It was also certified gold in Canada a week after its release.

===''The March'' (2008&ndash;2010)===
[[File:Unearth-01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Unearth in Barcelona (2010)]]
On October 14, 2008, Unearth released their fourth album, entitled ''[[The March (album)|The March]]''.

On September 20, 2010 it was announced that former bassist, Chris Rybicki was killed in a car accident caused by an intoxicated woman. He was 39 years old.<ref>[http://www.theinterlude.com/unearths-former-bassist-chris-rover-rybicki-killed/ UNEARTH’s Former Bassist Chris ‘Rover’ Rybicki Killed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403205819/http://www.theinterlude.com/unearths-former-bassist-chris-rover-rybicki-killed/ |date=April 3, 2012}} The Interlude</ref>

On October 25, 2010, Unearth issued a statement saying they and Derek Kerswill had amicably parted ways.  The band stated there is no bad blood towards Kerswill, and that the situation is purely based on musical differences.  [[Justin Foley]] will fill in for drums for their new album.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Unearth completed a North American tour with As I Lay Dying, All That Remains and Carnifex and headed to Europe for the 10-day "Persistence Tour" in December 2010.

===''Darkness in the Light'' (2011&ndash;2013)===
In January 2011 the band entered the studio to work on their fifth studio album entitled ''Darkness in the Light'', which was later released on July 5, 2011. The album was produced by [[Adam Dutkiewicz]] and drums were tracked by [[Justin Foley]]. On the Metal Injection LiveCast on Wednesday, April 13 Buz McGrath was the special guest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} He discussed the new album and mentioned a possible release date. He mentioned that it was vocalist's Trevor Phipps best effort on all the Unearth albums.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 2013, Unearth was a part of the Brothers of Brutality tour headlined by Whitechapel and Emmure. John did not perform this tour due to personal matters. Former [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]] bassist Iano Dovi and [[Chimaira]] guitarist [[Matt DeVries]] took over until his return.

===''Watchers of Rule'', departure of John Maggard (2014&ndash;2016)===
During fall 2014, Unearth released two tracks from their new album ''Watchers of Rule'', which was later released on October 28, 2014 via eOne Music and features 11 tracks on the regular edition and 13 tracks on the deluxe version.

In an interview with [[Noisefull]], lead guitarist Buz McGrath revealed that the band currently has an open bass player position, confirming that John 'Slo' Maggard (who had been missing from touring for the last two years and did not contribute to ''Watchers of Rule'') is no longer in the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noisefull.com/interviews/unearth-buz-mcgrath |title=Unearth (Buz McGrath) - Noisefull |last1=Tzirakis |first1=Antonis |date=November 7, 2014 |website=Noisefull.com|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>  DeVries, who had performed live bass on all but one tour since the start of 2013, also chose to end his association with the band (and indeed stepped out of music altogether) at year's end, with Chris O'Toole being selected as a live fill-in afterward. 

Unearth headlined the fury tour which featured acts like Fit For an Autopsy, Reflections, Great American Ghost, Ringworm and Culture Killer.
