'''Runrig''' was a Scottish [[Celtic rock]] band formed on the [[Isle of Skye]] in 1973. From its inception, the band's line-up included songwriters [[Rory Macdonald (musician)|Rory Macdonald]] and [[Calum MacDonald (musician)|Calum Macdonald]]. The line-up during most of the 1980s and 1990s (the band's most successful period) also included [[Donnie Munro]], Malcolm Jones, Iain Bayne, and [[Pete Wishart]]. Munro left the band in 1997 to pursue a career in politics and was replaced by [[Bruce Guthro]]. Wishart left in 2001 and was replaced by Brian Hurren. The band released fourteen studio albums, with a number of their songs sung in [[Scottish Gaelic]].

Initially formed as a three-piece dance band known as 'The Run Rig Dance Band', the band played several low key events, and has previously cited a [[ceilidh]] at Kelvin Hall, [[Glasgow]] as their first concert.<ref>{{cite web|title=#tbt 43 years ago today we played our first "concert", a ceilidh in the Kelvin Hall in Glasgow! Time flies.|url=https://twitter.com/runrig1973/status/725692295245357056|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref> Runrig's music is often described as a blend of [[folk music|folk]] and rock music, with the band's lyrics often focusing upon locations, history, politics, and people that are unique to Scotland. Songs also make references to agriculture, land conservation and religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/3687-runrig|title=Runrig – Artist Profile|website=eventseeker.com|language=en|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>

Since 1999, the band has gained attention in Canada, following [[Nova Scotia]]n singer Bruce Guthro's entry to the band. In 2016, the band announced that it would retire from studio recording after the release of its 14th studio album, ''[[The Story (Runrig album)|The Story]]''<ref>{{cite web|last1=RICK FULTON|title=Runrig release their final album but insist it's not the end of The Story|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/runrig-release-final-album-insist-7267508|website=Daily Record|access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref> and announced their final tour ''The Final Mile'' in 2017. In August 2018, Runrig performed the final shows of their farewell tour, entitled ''The Last Dance'', in [[Stirling]] City Park beneath the castle ramparts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Runrig – The Last Dance|url=http://www.runrig.co.uk/blog/2017/9/25/runrig-the-last-dance|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref> An estimated 52,000 fans attended ''The Last Dance''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Last Dance: thousands say farewell to Runrig|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/16584918.the-last-dance-thousands-say-farewell-to-runrig/|access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1973–1987) ===
The band was formed in 1973 with brothers Calum and Rory Macdonald and their friend Blair Douglas. [[Donnie Munro]] joined the following year and they started to expand outside their native Isle of [[Skye]]. Douglas left the band in late 1974 and was replaced by Robert Macdonald. This line-up continued until 1978, when Douglas re-joined and [[Malcolm Jones (musician)|Malcolm Jones]] became guitarist, both displacing Robert Macdonald.

In the same year, Runrig's first album, entitled ''[[Play Gaelic]]'', was released. All the songs were in Gaelic. It was re-released in 1990 as ''Play Gaelic, the first legendary recording''.

In 1979, Blair Douglas left Runrig again to pursue a solo career. 1979 also saw the release of Runrig's second album, ''[[The Highland Connection]]'' on the band's own label, Ridge Records. A somewhat transitional album, it features wailing electric guitars and [[ballad]]s. The album also included the original version of "[[Loch Lomond#The song|Loch Lomond]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/music/features/thetradtop100.shtml |title=In final BBC shortlist for top traditional Scottish song |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |access-date=21 October 2011}}</ref> A later version was to become their signature song and closing song at concerts.

The third Runrig album, ''[[Recovery (1981 album)|Recovery]]'' (released in 1981), was a [[concept album|thematic record]] dealing with the rise and politics of Scotland's Gaelic community. 1980 saw the arrival of drummer Iain Bayne (from Scottish folk/rock band [[New Celeste]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/play/b0bgbvkr|title=BBC Radio Scotland – 22/08/2018|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and [[synthesizer|keyboard]] player Richard Cherns.

In 1982, Runrig re-recorded "Loch Lomond" as their first single. They signed to a small label called Simple Records in 1984, and two singles were released. The first was "Dance Called America". A longer version of the second single "Skye" appeared on the Alba Records [[compilation album|compilation]] ''A Feast Of Scottish Folk Music, Volume One'' along with an early version of "Lifeline", both of which were previously unreleased on albums, and "Na h-Uain a's t-Earrach" which was the [[B-side]] to "Dance Called America".

[[File:Donnie Munro.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Original lead singer [[Donnie Munro]] left the band in 1997 to pursue a career in politics]] 

The band then engaged the services of producer [[Chris Rainbow|Chris Harley]] who brought to their recordings the benefit of his experience as a solo artist and a singer with The Alan Parsons Project and Camel.  Runrig's fourth independent studio album, ''[[Heartland (Runrig album)|''Heartland'']]'' (released in 1985), combined Gaelic sounds with anthemic rock music.

Richard Cherns left the band in February 1986 and was replaced by ex-[[Big Country]] member [[Pete Wishart]].

=== Major label and mainstream success (1987–1997) ===

The period from 1987 to 1997 marked Runrig's most successful run, during which they achieved placings in both the UK albums and singles charts, and toured extensively.

With (for the first time) major-label support (from [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]]), Runrig's fifth studio album, ''The Cutter and the Clan'' (1987), which had originally been released on the independent Ridge Records label before being re-released on Chrysalis, brought the band wider audiences in the United Kingdom, as well as in other parts of Europe.

From 1987 to 1995, Runrig released a total of five studio albums through Chrysalis Records. Along with ''The Cutter and the Clan'', the other four albums were: ''Searchlight'' (1989), ''The Big Wheel'' (1991), ''Amazing Things'' (1993), and ''Mara'' (1995).

On 22 June 1991, the band attracted around 50,000 people to an outdoor concert held in [[Balloch Country Park]], near Loch Lomond. This was the largest number of people to attend a Runrig concert.

Following the release of ''Mara'', lead singer Donnie Munro grew more involved in politics. In 1997, he left Runrig to stand for a seat in the House of Commons for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. However, he was not elected.

Runrig began searching for a new frontman, and in 1998 they announced their selection of Bruce Guthro, a singer-songwriter from [[Nova Scotia]].

=== Transitional challenges (1997 to 2001) ===
Runrig's tenth album, ''[[In Search Of Angels]]'' (1999), was released amidst some uncertainty about the band's future.

Since their contract with Chrysalis had ended, Runrig chose to release ''In Search Of Angels'' on their own label, Ridge Records. As a result, the record received much less promotion than the previous five, and sales were considerably smaller. Runrig was also faced with the challenge of acclimatising their fans to a new lead vocalist. The band toured extensively in support of the record, and in 2000, they also released a live album called ''[[Live at Celtic Connections 2000]]'', allowing fans to hear older Runrig songs sung by their new frontman.

The year 2000 concluded with the release of an authorised songbook, ''Flower of the West – The Runrig Songbook''. The book included lyrics, sheet music, photographs, and background information for 115 of Runrig's songs – nearly every album track and single from the band's first ten studio albums.

===Renewed popularity (2001–2009)===
[[File:Bruce Guthro at Edinburgh Castle with Runrig - Luly 26th 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bruce Guthro]] performing live with Runrig at [[Edinburgh Castle]], 2008]] 
Having established that they could continue without Donnie Munro, Runrig set to work on their eleventh studio album.

Among their independently-released studio albums, ''[[The Stamping Ground]]'' (2001) was Runrig's most successful.  Moreover, critics who had given mixed reviews to ''In Search Of Angels'', praised ''The Stamping Ground'' as the quintessential Runrig album. The band continued to enjoy support in the UK, Germany, and Denmark. However, with a Canadian frontman, Runrig began finding new fans in Canada and the United States.

In [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], [[Pete Wishart]], the band's keyboard player, left after being elected Member of Parliament for the constituency of [[Tayside North (UK Parliament constituency)|Tayside North]] for the [[Scottish National Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/key_people/newsid_1179000/1179393.stm |title=Pete Wishart: SNP |publisher=BBC News |date=22 March 2001 |access-date=21 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2174505.stm |title=BBC profile of Peter Wishart |publisher=BBC News |date=16 October 2002 |access-date=21 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/2041027.stm |title=Rock MP takes on music pirates |publisher=BBC News |date=12 June 2002 |access-date=21 October 2011}}</ref> In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]] he was again elected, this time for the new constituency of [[Perth and North Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and North Perthshire]] and again for the SNP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/content/articles/2005/05/11/mp4_music_feature.shtml |title=MP4 strike a chord with voters |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=13 May 2005 |access-date=21 October 2011}}</ref> Brian Hurren stepped in to take Wishart's place in the band.  {{As of|March 2019|post=,}} Wishart has been re-elected in each subsequent general election, albeit with a [[marginal seat|very slim majority]] in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]].

The 2001 album ''[[The Stamping Ground]]'' was seen very much as a return to form after the lacklustre ''[[In Search Of Angels]]'' (1999), but 2003's ''[[Proterra (album)|Proterra]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/r2music/folk/reviews/proterra.shtml |title=BBC review of Proterra |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=7 December 2005 |access-date=21 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/entertainment/louder/love/runrig/ |title=Runrig at the Sands Centre |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |access-date=21 October 2011}}</ref> divided opinion.

In August 2003, Runrig played their 30th Anniversary concert on the esplanade at Stirling Castle, celebrating 30 years since the band's formation, and including visitors from previous line-ups, as well as guest artists including the Glasgow Islay Choir and Paul Mounsey.

Runrig played their first U.S. concert, a benefit for the charity "Glasgow the Caring City", on 4 April 2006 at the Nokia Theatre in New York City.  Founding member Blair Douglas joined the band onstage, playing accordion on several numbers.  In the audience were fans from as far away as [[Texas]], [[Alabama]], Florida, [[Colorado]], [[Minnesota]], Norwich (England) and Scotland.

While the bulk of their 2007 tour was scheduled for Denmark, Germany, and England, an outdoor show, titled "Beat The Drum", was held at [[Loch Ness]] on 18 August 2007. It was staged at Borlum Farm, [[Drumnadrochit]] and attended by 18,500 people in heavy rain. Because of the unusually large number of support acts, it had been likened to an all-day music festival, Runrig being the headline act.<ref>{{cite news|author=Raymond Buchanan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6954703.stm |title=Fans beat the mud to see heroes |publisher=BBC News |date=20 August 2007 |access-date=21 October 2011}}</ref> This was the first in what was to become a staple for Runrig – annually staging big outdoor shows in Scotland in summer.

Runrig re-recorded "[[The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond|Loch Lomond]] (Hampden Remix)" to raise funds for the BBC's annual [[Children in Need]] appeal. This was released on 12 November [2007] and includes the '[[Tartan Army]]' (Scotland's Hampden Football Supporters), including [[Rod Stewart]], on backing vocals. It reached No. 9 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

"Loch Lomond (Hampden Remix)" was named "The Best Scottish Song Of All Time" in November 2008. The band were presented the award by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Runrig's Loch Lomond 'Scotland's greatest song'| publisher =[[The Scotsman]] | date = 30 November 2008| url = http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/Runrig39s-Loch-Lomond-39Scotland39s-greatest.4746392.jp | access-date = 6 December 2008}}</ref> On 5 December 2008, during the penultimate tour date at [[Barrowlands|The Barrowlands]], Glasgow, the band was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall Of Fame, by the Scottish Traditional Music Awards Director.<ref>{{cite web| title = Inductees 2008| publisher = STMHF| url = http://www.tradmusichall.com/hofinductees.htm| access-date = 6 December 2008| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081231051702/http://www.tradmusichall.com/hofinductees.htm| archive-date = 31 December 2008| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

On 29 August 2009, Runrig performed at [[Scone Palace]] for their third annual outdoor summer show (the second being at [[Edinburgh Castle]] in 2008). They were supported by acts such as the [[Peatbog Faeries]], piper Fred Morrison, [[King Creosote]], Kathleen Macinnes, and Blair Douglas (a former member of the group) and his band. Attendance numbered ~15,000.<br/>The show was part of Scotland's Year of Homecoming 2009. To underline this, First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] made an appearance on stage (introduced by his [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] colleague and former band member [[Pete Wishart]]), and launched an initiative called 'SconeStone.' This aims to promote [[Scotland]] as a kind and compassionate nation through the "journey of kindness" made by the SconeStone across the world. Its keepers, each holding it for a week before passing it on, are expected to undertake a good deed. Its first keeper was the Reverend Neil Galbraith, who was presented with the stone on the same day.

=== Health concerns (2009–2010) ===
In March 2009, guitarist Malcolm Jones suffered a heart attack in Edinburgh whilst running to catch a train.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7934676.stm |title=UK &#124; Scotland &#124; Edinburgh, East and Fife &#124; Runrig guitarist Jones collapses |publisher=BBC News |date=10 March 2009 |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> This forced the band to cancel a sizable tour of Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Germany. After undergoing minor surgery, he took to the stage with Runrig again in May of the same year. During a routine check up with his doctors in June 2009, he was strongly advised to have [[heart bypass]] surgery, which forced the band to cancel a tour of Denmark.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8107396.stm |title=Scotland &#124; Edinburgh, East and Fife &#124; Heart bypass for Runrig guitarist |publisher=BBC News |date=18 June 2009 |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> The operation was a success and, although the band was forced to cancel their show at the 35th [[Tønder Festival]] in [[Tønder]], Denmark, Malcolm returned to the stage in late August 2009, at the band's big outdoor Scottish [[Homecoming Scotland 2009|Homecoming]] show for 2009 at [[Scone Palace]], Perthshire, Scotland. However, on 28 February 2010, just a week prior to an extensive German tour, it was announced that Malcolm would have to have yet another operation which in turn forced the band to cancel/postpone their Spring dates in Germany, due to start on 3 March 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/8542891.stm |title=Implant operation for Runrig guitarist Malcolm Jones |publisher=BBC News |date=1 March 2010 |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> In a statement released by the band on their official website they noted that Malcolm's health was "good" and that the problem was "purely a technical one". They also emphatically stated that "All other concerts planned for 2010 will go ahead."
It was announced that the winter tour scheduled for winter 2010 would be the last tour for a year with the band planning no concerts in 2011 so that they could focus on other projects. The final date for 2010 was in the [[Barrowland Ballroom]], Glasgow which is traditionally where the band finishes their Scottish tours. In a statement released by the office, they promised it to be "quite a party".

On 1 November 2010, the band released a four-disc compilation, entitled ''[[50 Great Songs]]''. The release includes both studio and live performances, focusing primarily upon Bruce Guthro's time within the band.

=== Year off and ''Rewired'' (2011–2012) ===
After the end of the 2010 tour the band collectively made the decision to take a year off. 
Calum and Rory had been concentrating on a long-gestating project outside of Runrig. The duo call themselves [[The Band from Rockall]] and released their debut album outside of Runrig at the end of April 2012.
Keyboardist Brian Hurren also released his debut solo album, which he wrote, performed and produced himself, under the name ''A Hundred Thousand Welcomes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahtw.co.uk/ |title=ahtw.co.uk |publisher=ahtw.co.uk |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> the inspiration for the name coming from Bruce Guthro shouting the Gaelic equivalent of the phrase during "Beat the Drum" at Loch Ness. 
Guthro released another solo album, while drummer Iain Bayne was appointed manager of English [[folk-rock]] band [[Coast (folk rock band)|Coast]]. 
The band re-united as a six-piece again in the summer of 2012 for the Rewired Tour, with the big Scottish outdoor show held in August at the Northern Meeting Park in [[Inverness]].

=== 40th anniversary (2013–2014) ===
In November 2012, ahead of their planned Rewired Tour, the band announced a special 40th Anniversary Concert at the Black Isle Show Ground in [[Muir of Ord]], near [[Inverness]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safeconcerts.com/festivals/runrig-party-on-the-moor-the-40th-anniversary-weekend/ |title=Runrig 'Party on the Moor' the 40th anniversary weekend 2013|publisher=Safeconcerts.com |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> The 40th Anniversary show was a weekend of live entertainment featuring 'special guests', entitled "Party on the Moor".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-23620167 |title=BBC News – Runrig holds 40th anniversary bash |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=9 August 2013 |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> Shortly after that they announced another "special" concert at [[Edinburgh Castle]] in July, entitled "Celebration in the City". On 28 April 2013 (to mark Runrig's first ever concert 40 years earlier) Runrig released their first single in 5 years entitled "And We'll Sing".  
At Party on the Moor former members [[Donnie Munro]] and [[Pete Wishart]] performed onstage alongside the current lineup and Blair Douglas made an appearance via a short video highlighting the changes in the band's lineup since 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/Whats-On/Music/Review-Old-friends-help-Runrig-party-on-the-Moor-12082013.htm |title=Review: Old friends help Runrig party on the Moor &#124; Inverness Courier &#124; Whats-On &#124; Music |publisher=Inverness Courier |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref> This was the first time Munro had performed with Runrig since 1997, and for many it was a powerful statement seeing [[Bruce Guthro|Guthro]] and Munro singing together as there had been heated debates about who should be the band's frontman, and who was the better frontman among many fans and critics. The gig was hailed as a success by fans and critics many calling it one of the best concerts Runrig have ever staged. Bassist, Rory Macdonald said that "in many ways, it was the perfect Runrig gig" whilst drummer, Iain Bayne called it "the culmination of a lifetime's work".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=133938706776593 |title=Runrig – Party on the Moor |publisher=Facebook |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref>

In late 2013 it was announced that Runrig would embark on a Spring 2014 tour of England to continue the 40th Anniversary celebrations. Entitled "Party on the Tour" it would "draw inspiration" from the Party on the Moor show. Alongside the English dates, several European [[music festivals]] were announced for 2014. In December 2013 it was officially confirmed that Party on the Moor would be released on DVD. In January further details for the DVD were released. On 31 March 2014 Runrig released the full, uncut concert on both DVD, CD and, for the first time ever for Runrig, [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runrig.co.uk/?p=256 |title=Party on the Moor – Live DVD &#124; Runrig &#124; 40th Anniversary |publisher=Runrig |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref>

===''The Story'' (2014–2017)===
[[File:Runrig at Stirling, 18-08-2018 (1).jpg|thumb|right|Runrig on stage during ''The Last Dance'' in Stirling]] 
The band announced in issue 74 of The Wire magazine and on their official Twitter feed that they had begun work on their 14th studio album. It was also announced (informally) that to accommodate for the time it takes to write, record and produce an album they would not be playing any further live shows in 2014 after the [[Tønder Festival]], due to be held on 28 and 29 August 2014. In the summer 2015 issue of The Wire it was revealed that the album would be called ''[[The Story (Runrig album)|The Story]]'', and would be released in spring 2016.

On 12 November 2015 the title track, and lead single, received its first radio play on [[BBC Radio nan Gàidheal]]. During an interview with the show's host Derek Murray, Calum Macdonald said that the upcoming album would likely be the last studio album that the band would release, also confirming the album's release date as 29 January 2016. On 13 November 2015, the single was released in both CD and digital download form accompanied by a music video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runrig.co.uk/?p=302|title=Welcome|website=Runrig – The Story|access-date=23 March 2018}}</ref> Shortly after the single was released, the band announced that along with a sizeable tour of the UK and Europe in 2016 they would both be headlining the 21st [[HebCelt]] Festival on the [[Isle of Lewis]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-34908414|title=Runrig to headline HebCelt festival|date=24 November 2015|access-date=23 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and staging an outdoor show at [[Edinburgh Castle]] in July 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/runrig-to-stage-edinburgh-castle-gig-in-2016-1-3956814|title=Runrig to stage Edinburgh Castle gig in 2016|website=scotsman.com|access-date=23 March 2018}}</ref>

===''The Last Dance'' and disbandment (2017–2018)===

On 26 September 2017 Runrig announced that after 45 years they would be "pulling the curtain down" on their music careers. The band announced one final tour named The Final Mile, taking part in Germany, Denmark and UK, ending with one final show in [[Stirling]]'s City Park called ''The Last Dance''. Tickets for The Last Dance sold out in minutes and, after a few days of behind the scenes planning, Runrig announced another concert in the same location the night before. Tickets for this night sold out in less than six hours. It was a very emotional farewell, and the uncertain Scottish weather held out for their final rendition of "Loch Lomond."

Many of the band's songs include references to Scottish history or culture. These include the band's name itself – which is a reference to a pre–agricultural revolution farming practice, [[run rig]].
