Shingles and [[chickenpox]] are distinct human diseases but are closely related in their life cycles. Both originate from infection of an individual with the [[varicella zoster virus]] (VZV). Chickenpox, also called varicella, results from the initial infection with the virus, typically occurring during childhood or adolescence.<ref name=Pink2015/> Once the chickenpox has resolved, the virus can remain [[virus latency|inactive]] (dormant) in human [[nerve cell]]s for years or decades,<ref name=Pink2015/> after which it may reactivate.  Shingles results when the dormant varicella virus is reactivated.<ref name=Pink2015/>  Then the virus travels along nerve bodies to nerve endings in the skin, producing blisters.<ref name=Gag2019/> During an outbreak of shingles, exposure to the varicella virus found in shingles blisters can cause chickenpox in someone who has not yet had chickenpox; this initial infection will not trigger shingles, however.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shingles (Herpes Zoster) Transmission |url=https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/about/transmission.html|access-date=26 May 2015|date=September 17, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506112409/http://www.cdc.gov/shingles/about/transmission.html|archive-date=6 May 2015| publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> How the virus remains dormant in the body or subsequently re-activates is not well understood.<ref name=Pink2015/>

In most cases, after one to two days—but sometimes as long as three weeks—the initial phase is followed by the appearance of the characteristic skin rash. The pain and rash most commonly occur on the torso but can appear on the face, eyes, or other parts of the body. At first, the rash appears similar to the first appearance of [[hives]]; however, unlike hives, shingles causes skin changes limited to a dermatome, normally resulting in a stripe or belt-like pattern that is limited to one side of the body and does not cross the midline.<ref name=pmid10794584/> <!-- Do not delete anchor, links from Bell's Palsy -->{{Anchor|Zoster sine herpete}} ''Zoster sine herpete'' ("zoster without herpes") describes a person who has all of the symptoms of shingles except this characteristic rash.<ref name=pmid10980741>{{cite journal |vauthors=Furuta Y, Ohtani F, Mesuda Y, Fukuda S, Inuyama Y |title=Early diagnosis of zoster sine herpete and antiviral therapy for the treatment of facial palsy |journal=[[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]] |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=708–10 |year=2000 |pmid=10980741 |doi=10.1212/WNL.55.5.708| s2cid = 29270135 }}</ref>

Later the rash becomes [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicular]], forming small blisters filled with a [[serous exudate]], as the fever and general malaise continue. The painful vesicles eventually become cloudy or darkened as they fill with blood, and crust over within seven to ten days; usually the crusts fall off and the skin heals, but sometimes, after severe blistering, scarring and discolored skin remain.<ref name=pmid10794584/>

==Diagnosis==
[[Image:Herpes zoster chest.png|right|thumb|Shingles on the chest]]
If the rash has appeared, identifying this disease (making a [[differential diagnosis]]) requires only a visual examination, since very few diseases produce a rash in a dermatomal pattern (see map). However, [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV) can occasionally produce a rash in such a pattern (zosteriform herpes simplex).<ref name=Koh>{{cite journal| vauthors = Koh MJ, Seah PP, Teo RY |title=Zosteriform herpes simplex|journal=[[Singapore Med.

==Treatment==
The aims of treatment are to limit the severity and duration of pain, shorten the duration of a shingles episode, and reduce complications.

However, a study on untreated shingles shows that, once the rash has cleared, postherpetic neuralgia is very rare in people under 50 and wears off in time; in older people, the pain wore off more slowly, but even in people over 70, 85% were free from pain a year after their shingles outbreak.<ref name=pmid11009518>{{cite journal | vauthors = Helgason S, Petursson G, Gudmundsson S, Sigurdsson JA | title= Prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia after a single episode of herpes zoster: prospective study with long term follow up | journal= [[British Medical Journal]] | volume= 321 | year= 2000 | pmid= 11009518 | doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7264.794 | issue= 7264 | pages= 794–96 | pmc= 27491 }}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The rash and pain usually subside within three to five weeks, but about one in five people develops a painful condition called [[postherpetic neuralgia]], which is often difficult to manage. In some people, shingles can reactivate presenting as ''zoster sine herpete'': pain radiating along the path of a single spinal nerve (a ''dermatomal distribution''), but without an accompanying [[rash]]. This condition may involve complications that affect several levels of the [[nervous system]] and cause many [[brain|cranial]] [[neuropathy|neuropathies]], [[neuritis|polyneuritis]], [[myelitis]], or [[aseptic meningitis]]. Other serious effects that may occur in some cases include partial [[Bell's palsy|facial paralysis]] (usually temporary), ear damage, or [[encephalitis]].<ref name=pmid12676845/> Although initial infections with VZV during pregnancy, causing chickenpox, may lead to infection of the fetus and complications in the newborn, chronic infection or reactivation in shingles are not associated with fetal infection.<ref name=pmid3012334>{{cite journal |vauthors=Paryani SG, Arvin AM |title=Intrauterine infection with varicella-zoster virus after maternal varicella |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=314 |issue=24 |pages=1542–46 |year=1986 |pmid=3012334 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198606123142403 }}</ref><ref name=Enders>{{cite journal |vauthors=Enders G, Miller E, Cradock-Watson J, Bolley I, Ridehalgh M  |title=Consequences of varicella and herpes zoster in pregnancy: prospective study of 1739 cases |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=343 |issue=8912 |pages=1548–51 |year=1994 |pmid=7802767 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(94)92943-2 | s2cid = 476280 }}</ref>

==History==
Shingles has a long recorded history, although historical accounts fail to distinguish the blistering caused by VZV and those caused by [[smallpox]],<ref name=pmid18021864/> [[ergotism]], and [[erysipelas]]. In the late 18th century [[William Heberden]] established a way to differentiate shingles and smallpox,<ref>{{cite book|author=Weller TH |year=2000 |chapter=Chapter 1. Historical perspective |title=Varicella-Zoster Virus: Virology and Clinical Management |veditors=Arvin AM, Gershon AA |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-66024-2}}</ref> and in the late 19th century, shingles was differentiated from erysipelas. In 1831 [[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]] hypothesized that the disease arose from the dorsal root ganglion, and an 1861 paper by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Felix von Bärensprung|Felix von Bärensprung]] confirmed this.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Oaklander AL |title= The pathology of shingles: Head and Campbell's 1900 monograph |journal= [[Arch.

Recognition that chickenpox and shingles were caused by the same virus came at the beginning of the 20th century. Physicians began to report that cases of shingles were often followed by chickenpox in younger people who lived with the person with shingles. The idea of an association between the two diseases gained strength when it was shown that lymph from a person with shingles could induce chickenpox in young volunteers. This was finally proved by the first isolation of the virus in [[cell cultures]], by the Nobel laureate [[Thomas Huckle Weller]], in 1953.<ref name=pmid13064265>{{cite journal |author= Weller TH |title=Serial propagation in vitro of agents producing inclusion bodies derived from varicella and herpes zoster |journal=[[Proc.

Until the 1940s the disease was considered benign, and serious complications were thought to be very rare.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Holt LE, McIntosh R |title= Holt's Diseases of Infancy and Childhood |url=https://archive.org/details/b31351554 |year=1936 |publisher=D Appleton Century Company |pages=931–33}}</ref> However, by 1942, it was recognized that shingles was a more serious disease in adults than in children and that it increased in frequency with advancing age. Further studies during the 1950s on immunosuppressed individuals showed that the disease was not as benign as once thought, and the search for various therapeutic and preventive measures began.<ref name=Weller>{{cite book |author=Weller TH |chapter=Varicella-herpes zoster virus |title=Viral Infections of Humans: Epidemiology and Control |veditors=Evans AS, Kaslow RA |publisher=Plenum Press |year=1997 |pages=865–92 |isbn=978-0-306-44855-3}}</ref> By the mid-1960s, several studies identified the gradual reduction in cellular immunity in old age, observing that in a cohort of 1,000 people who lived to the age of 85, approximately 500 (i.e., 50%) would have at least one attack of shingles, and 10 (i.e., 1%) would have at least two attacks.<ref name="hopesimpson65">{{cite journal |author=Hope-Simpson RE |year=1965 |title=The nature of herpes zoster; a long-term study and a new hypothesis |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine]] |volume=58 | pages=9–20 |pmid=14267505 |pmc=1898279 |issue=1|doi=10.1177/003591576505800106 }}</ref>

In historical shingles studies, shingles incidence generally increased with age.  However, in his 1965 paper, [[Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson|Hope-Simpson]] suggested that the "peculiar age distribution of zoster may in part reflect the frequency with which the different age groups encounter cases of varicella and because of the ensuing boost to their antibody protection have their attacks of zoster postponed".<ref name="Hope-Simpson"/>

===Etymology===
The family name of all the [[herpesviridae|herpesviruses]] derives from the Greek word {{lang|el|herpēs}},<ref>{{LSJ|e(/rphs|ἕρπης|ref}}.</ref> from {{lang|el|herpein}} ("to creep"),<ref>{{LSJ|e(/rpw|ἕρπειν|shortref}}.</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|herpes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/herpes|title=Herpes &#124; Define Herpes at Dictionary.com|access-date=2011-03-14|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225123419/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/herpes|archive-date=2011-02-25}}</ref> referring to the latent, recurring infections typical of this group of viruses. ''Zoster'' comes from Greek {{lang|el|zōstēr}},<ref>{{LSJ|zwsth/r|ζωστήρ|shortref}}.</ref> meaning "belt" or "girdle", after the characteristic belt-like dermatomal rash.<ref>{{OEtymD|zoster}}</ref> The common name for the disease, ''shingles'', derives from the Latin {{lang|la|cingulus}}, a variant of Latin {{lang|la|cingulum}},<ref>{{L&S|cingulus|lL&S}}, {{L&S|cingulum1|cingulum|ref}}</ref> meaning "girdle".<ref>{{OEtymD|shingles}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Yawn BP, Gilden D |title=The global epidemiology of herpes zoster |journal=[[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]]|date=3 September 2013|volume=81|issue=10|pages=928–30|pmid=23999562|doi=10.1212/wnl.0b013e3182a3516e|pmc=3885217}}</ref>

==Research==
Until the mid 1990s, infectious complications of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) caused by VZV reactivation were regarded as rare.  The presence of rash, as well as specific neurological symptoms, were required to diagnose a CNS infection caused by VZV.  Since 2000, PCR testing has become more widely used, and the number of diagnosed cases of CNS infection has increased.<ref name="ijidonline.com">{{cite journal |title = Infection of the central nervous system caused by varicella zoster virus reactivation: a retrospective case series study |url = http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(13)00096-9/abstract |journal = [[International Journal of Infectious Diseases]] |date=July 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2013.01.031 |volume=17 |issue = 7 |pages=e529–34| vauthors = Becerra JC, Sieber R, Martinetti G, Costa ST, Meylan P, Bernasconi E |pmid=23566589|doi-access = free }}</ref>

Classic textbook descriptions state that VZV reactivation in the CNS is restricted to immunocompromised individuals and the elderly; however, studies have found that most patients are immunocompetent, and less than 60 years old. Historically, vesicular rash was considered a characteristic finding, but studies have found that rash is only present in 45% of cases.<ref name="ijidonline.com"/>
In addition, systemic inflammation is not as reliable an indicator as previously thought:  the mean level of C-reactive protein and mean white blood cell count are within the normal range in patients with VZV meningitis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ihekwaba UK, Kudesia G, McKendrick MW |title = Clinical features of viral meningitis in adults: significant differences in cerebrospinal fluid findings among herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and enterovirus infections | journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume=47 | issue=6 | date=September 15, 2008 | issn=1058-4838 | pmid=18680414 | doi=10.1086/591129 | pages=783–9 | doi-access=free }}</ref>
MRI and CT scans are usually normal in cases of VZV reactivation in the CNS.  CSF pleocytosis, previously thought to be a strong indicator of VZV encephalitis, was absent in half of a group of patients diagnosed with VZV encephalitis by PCR.<ref name="ijidonline.com"/>

The frequency of CNS infections presented at the emergency room of a community hospital is not negligible, so a means of diagnosing cases is needed.  PCR is not a foolproof method of diagnosis, but because so many other indicators have turned out to not be reliable in diagnosing VZV infections in the CNS, screening for VZV by PCR is recommended.   Negative PCR does not rule out VZV involvement, but a positive PCR can be used for diagnosis, and appropriate treatment started (for example, antivirals can be prescribed rather than antibiotics).<ref name="ijidonline.com"/>

The introduction of DNA analysis techniques has shown some complications of varicella-zoster to be more common than previously thought.  For example, sporadic meningoencephalitis (ME) caused by varicella-zoster was regarded as rare disease, mostly related to childhood chickenpox.  However, meningoencephalitis caused by varicella-zoster is increasingly recognized as a predominant cause of ME among immunocompetent adults in non-epidemic circumstances.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite journal|title       = Varicella zoster vs. herpes simplex meningoencephalitis in the PCR era.

Diagnosis of complications of varicella-zoster, particularly in cases where the disease reactivates after years or decades of latency, is difficult.   A rash (shingles) can be present or absent.  Symptoms vary, and there is a significant overlap in symptoms with herpes-simplex symptoms.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>

Although DNA analysis techniques such as [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can be used to look for DNA of herpesviruses in spinal fluid or blood, the results may be negative, even in cases where other definitive symptoms exist.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima Y, Hashiguchi H, Hashimoto T, Tsuji S, Shoji H, Kazuyama Y |title = Recurrent Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Meningitis: A Case Report of Mollaret's Meningitis |url = http://www0.nih.go.jp/JJID/SC-29.pdf | journal=Japanese Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=55 | issue=3 | date=15 September 2008 | issn=1344-6304 | pmid=12195049 | pages=85–8 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130122201650/http://www0.nih.go.jp/JJID/SC-29.pdf |archive-date = 2013-01-22 }}
</ref> Notwithstanding these limitations, the use of PCR has resulted in an advance in the state of the art in our understanding of herpesviruses, including VZV, during the 1990s and 2000s.  For example, in the past, [[clinician]]s believed that [[encephalitis]] was caused by [[herpes simplex]] and that patients always died or developed serious long-term function problems.  People were diagnosed at [[autopsy]] or by [[brain biopsy]].  Brain biopsy is not undertaken lightly:  it is reserved only for serious cases that cannot be diagnosed by less invasive methods.  For this reason, knowledge of these herpes virus conditions was limited to severe cases.  DNA techniques have made it possible to diagnose "mild" cases, caused by VZV or HSV, in which the symptoms include fever, headache, and altered mental status.   Mortality rates in treated patients are decreasing.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>
