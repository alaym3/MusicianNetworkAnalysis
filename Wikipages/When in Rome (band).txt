'''When in Rome''' are an English [[synth-pop]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] group, which originally consisted of vocalists Clive Farrington and Andrew Mann, and keyboardist Michael Floreale. They are best known for their 1988 single "[[The Promise (When in Rome song)|The Promise]]", which was their only top 40 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the US. As of July 2012, there were two bands using the When in Rome name.<ref name="Farrington">{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/13/when-rome-original-lead-singer-clive-farrington-di/ |title=When in Rome's Clive Farrington 'fires back' |author=Valcourt, Keith |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=13 March 2016 |access-date=13 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="Gaydos">{{cite web |url=http://citizensvoice.com/arts-living/singer-clive-farrington-shares-humble-beginnings-of-when-in-rome-uk-1.1345227 |title=Singer Clive Farrington shares humble beginnings of When in Rome UK |author=Gaydos, Kristen |publisher=[[The Citizens' Voice]] |date=19 June 2012 |access-date=14 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="Pollstar">{{cite web |url=https://www.pollstar.com/article/when-in-rome-name-dispute-19967 |title=When in Rome Name Dispute |author=Amendola, Tina |publisher=[[Pollstar]] |date=27 May 2011 |access-date=14 August 2017}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation===
Michael Floreale and Andy O'Connell were recruited by Clive Farrington to replace departed members of his Manchester-based group Beau Leisure.<ref name="Cryptic Rock">{{cite web |url=http://crypticrock.com/interview-clive-farrington-rome-uk/ |title=Interview – Clive Farrington of When in Rome UK |publisher=Cryptic Rock |date=26 May 2017 |access-date=19 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=KIOS/> Floreale and Farrington began to write songs together. Later, Farrington and Floreale saw Andrew Mann, a beat poet, and had him join their performances.<ref name=KIOS>{{cite web|url=http://oldschool.tblog.com/post/1970110112 |title=Back to the 80s: Interview with Michael Floreale & Clive Farrington of When in Rome|publisher=Kickin' it Old School|date=10 February 2011}}</ref> O'Connell left the group; the remaining trio recorded some demos – sometimes including Mann's friend [[Corinne Drewery]] of [[Swing Out Sister]] – while seeking a recording deal.<ref name="Cryptic Rock"/><ref name=KIOS/> Farrington and Floreale came up with the band name after using the [[When in Rome, do as the Romans do|famous proverb]] to note the cultural differences between Manchester and London.<ref name="Gaydos"/> The band was signed to [[Elektra Records]] for a month before the label closed its London office, forcing the band to leave due to the time difference with the U.S.<ref name="Cryptic Rock"/>

===Debut album===
The band was signed to [[Virgin Records|Virgin UK]] subsidiary 10 Records, and their [[When in Rome (When in Rome album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on 3 May 1988. Producers Ben Rogan (who had worked with [[Sade (band)|Sade]]) and [[Richard James Burgess]] took special interest in the trio's song "[[The Promise (When in Rome song)|The Promise]]", issued first as a 12" dance disc. When the song became popular, hitting the top of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Dance Club Play chart, Virgin ordered an album. A remixed version of "The Promise" was the album's first single. It was an instant success, barely missing the top ten in the United States, peaking at No.&nbsp;11.<ref name=billboard/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.professorofrock.com/the-promise-by-when-in-rome/ |title=The Promise by When in Rome |website=Professor of Rock |access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref> Months later, the trio reached ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop chart's lower reaches for the last time with "[[Heaven Knows (When in Rome song)|Heaven Knows]]" (No.&nbsp;95, 1990).<ref name=billboard/> Additional singles did little on the charts, and the group ultimately faded away.

===Breakup, reformation, and legal issues===
In 1990, Floreale was fired by Farrington and Mann over creative differences and When in Rome disbanded shortly after Virgin Records dropped them in 1993.<ref name="Farrington"/><ref name="Cryptic Rock"/> Floreale moved to the United States, and now lives in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], where he composes music for television and film.<ref>[http://www.lasysinc.com/Pop_Music/British_Pop_Music/JAYDEN_FROST_WHEN_IN_ROME_Blue.html L.A.S.Y.S. Inc.] Artist Summary: Jayden Frost. Frost's album ''Blue'' was produced by Floreale.</ref> Tensions arose between the members again in 2003, when "The Promise" was used in the 2004 film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' and Floreale made sole claim to the song, despite the trio receiving equal royalties.<ref name="Farrington"/><ref name="Cryptic Rock"/>

Floreale reformed the band in 2006 with vocalist and guitarist John Ceravolo under the name "When in Rome II".<ref name=KIOS/><ref name="Floreale">{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/when-rome-ii-revives-promise-hit-revitalized-band/ |title=When in Rome II: 'Keeping the Promise' |author=Valcourt, Keith |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=10 February 2016 |access-date=13 August 2017}}</ref> Since then, the band has toured the United States and South America with various other 1980s groups.<ref name=KIOS/><ref>{{cite web | author=Jacquelyn Carberry | title=Musical memories: It's time for the 1980s to get the nostalgia treatment with the Lost '80s Live tour  | url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/09/21/features/story03.html | publisher=Honolulu Star Bulletin | date=21 September 2007 | access-date=11 April 2009 }}</ref> Farrington and Mann reformed in 2009, under the name "When in Rome UK".<ref>[http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/archive/showartefact.php?bid=1078 Manchester Direct Music Archive:] When in Rome (submitted by Clive Farrington)</ref> Floreale, however, had trademarked the name "When in Rome" in 2010,<ref name="Pollstar"/><ref name="Farrington"/><ref name="Floreale"/><ref name="Gaydos"/> which was unsuccessfully challenged by Farrington and Mann.<ref name="Farrington"/><ref name="Floreale"/> According to a ''[[Pollstar]]'' article in May 2011, the US trademark has been acknowledged: "In order to comply with the legal claim, the UK members, are billed as "Clive Farrington and Andrew Mann formerly of When In Rome" for U.S. gigs.<ref name="Pollstar"/> In addition, Floreale filed an infringement claim against Rob Juarez, an associate of Farrington and Mann who attempted to trademark his [[Tribute act|tribute band]] name "When in Rome Revisited".<ref name="Pollstar"/>

===Present day===
On 10 May 2016, Farrington, with Pat Flanagan, published his autobiography ''Confessions of a One Hit Wonder: "The Promise" ... And the Aftermath''.<ref name="Gaydos"/>

As of 2019, When in Rome UK performs in the U.S. as "Farrington+Mann Original Members of When in Rome UK".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lost80slive.com/artist/clive-farrington-original-vocals-rome/ |title=Farrington + Mann Original Members of When in Rome UK |website=Lost 80s Live! |access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref>

In 2020, Farrington+Mann, in collaboration with the [[City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Slovenia Symphonic Film Orchestra, released a 30th anniversary orchestral edition of their hit song "The Promise" on both CD and vinyl.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADAY062 Farrington And Mann "The Promise" |url=http://www.augustday.net/aday062.html |website=August Day |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>
