Vedder was born Edward Louis Severson&nbsp;III in the Chicago suburb of [[Evanston, Illinois]], on December 23, 1964, to Karen Lee Vedder and Edward Louis Severson Jr.<ref name=vedders1>{{cite web|url=http://www.vedders.nl/index.html |title=Genealogieën van diverse families Vedder en Vedders |publisher=vedders.nl |access-date=January 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=wargs1>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/severson.html |title=Ancestry of Eddie Vedder |publisher=Wargs.com |access-date=December 8, 2011}}</ref> His parents divorced in 1965 when Vedder was an infant.

August 20, 1993.</ref> In the mid-1970s, the family, including Vedder's three younger half-brothers, moved to [[San Diego County, California]]. It was at this point that Vedder, who had received a guitar from his mother on his twelfth birthday, began turning to music (as well as surfing) as a source of comfort. He particularly found solace in [[The Who]]'s 1973 album, ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.<ref>Kot, Greg. [http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/ct070995.shtml "Rebels With a Cause"].

His mother and brothers moved back to the Chicago area, but Vedder remained with his stepfather in California so he would not have to change schools.

After the divorce, Vedder learned the truth about his parentage: Mueller was really his stepfather. Vedder had met his biological father briefly as a child, but had believed that Severson was merely an old friend of his parents. By the time Vedder learned the truth, Severson had died of [[multiple sclerosis]]. During his senior year at [[San Dieguito Academy|San Dieguito High School]], Vedder moved out to live on his own in an apartment, supporting himself with a nightly job at a drug store in [[Encinitas, California|Encinitas]].<ref name="Hilburn"/> Because of the pressure of work and school, Vedder dropped out of high school.<ref name="Hilburn"/> He joined the rest of his family in Chicago, and it was at this time that he changed his name to Vedder, his mother's maiden name.

The songs tell the story of a young man who, like Vedder, learns that he had been lied to about his paternity and that his real father is dead, grows up to become a serial killer, and is eventually imprisoned and sentenced to death.<ref name="crowe"/> Vedder recorded vocals for the three songs, and mailed the demo tape back to Seattle. The three songs would later become Pearl Jam's "[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]", "[[Once (Pearl Jam song)|Once]]", and "[[Footsteps (Pearl Jam song)|Footsteps]]".

After hearing Vedder's tape, former [[Mother Love Bone]] members [[Stone Gossard]] and [[Jeff Ament]] invited Vedder to come to Seattle to audition for their new band. They were instantly impressed with his unique sound. At the time, Gossard and Ament were working on the [[Temple of the Dog]] project founded by [[Soundgarden]]'s [[Chris Cornell]] as a musical tribute to Mother Love Bone's frontman [[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]], who died of a heroin overdose at age 24. Soundgarden drummer [[Matt Cameron]] and newcomer [[Mike McCready]] were also a part of the project. The song "[[Hunger Strike (song)|Hunger Strike]]" became a duet between Cornell and Vedder.

==Musical style and influences==

Vedder was heavily inspired by the early [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] sound, stating that: "I'm a big fan of Jethro Tull, and I listen to this record [''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]''] every night before I go on stage!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tullpress.com/gwjun99.htm|title=Jethro Tull Press: Guitar World, June 1999|work=tullpress.com|access-date=May 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311053104/http://www.tullpress.com/gwjun99.htm|archive-date=March 11, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", from ''Ten''; "Better Man", from ''Vitalogy'') to social and political concerns ("[[Even Flow]]", from ''Ten''; "[[World Wide Suicide]]", from ''Pearl Jam''). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, [[individualism]], and sympathy for troubled individuals.<ref>Tannenbaum, Rob. [http://www.fivehorizons.com/archive/articles/george_700.shtml "Rebels Without a Pause"]. ''[[George (magazine)|George]]''. July 2000.</ref> Other recurring themes include the use of water metaphors,<ref>Lindgren, Hugo. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/10/arts/music-pearl-jam-turns-pop-fame-on-its-head-less-is-more.html?scp=1&sq=pearl+jam+riot&st=nyt "Music; Pearl Jam Turns Pop Fame on Its Head: Less Is More"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. November 10, 2002.</ref> as well as the idea of leaving everything behind to start again (featured in such songs as "[[Rearviewmirror (song)|Rearviewmirror]]", from ''Vs.''; "MFC", from ''Yield''; "Evacuation", from ''Binaural''; and "[[Gone (Pearl Jam song)|Gone]]", from ''Pearl Jam'').

Although best known as a vocalist, Vedder also plays guitar on many Pearl Jam songs, beginning with the ''Vs.'' songs "Rearviewmirror" and "[[Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town]]". When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the ''Vitalogy'' era. McCready said in 2006, "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a [[power chord]] thing, and I fit into all that."<ref>Cross, Charles R. "Better Man". ''Guitar World Presents: Guitar Legends: Pearl Jam''. July 2006.</ref> Vedder's guitar playing helped the band's sound progress toward a more stripped-down style; the songs "Rearviewmirror" and "[[Corduroy (song)|Corduroy]]" (from ''Vitalogy'') feature Vedder's raw, punk-influenced guitar playing. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less [[Hook (music)|catchy]]. He said, "I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes."<ref name="secondcoming"/> He has also contributed performances on the [[ukulele]], harmonica, [[accordion]], and [[electric sitar]] to various Pearl Jam recordings.

===Live performances===
[[File:PearlJam01London2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Vedder with Pearl Jam in London, 2018]]
Throughout Pearl Jam's career, Vedder has interacted with the crowd during the band's concerts. Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in [[stage diving]] as well as [[crowd surfing]]. During the early part of Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage lighting rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, "It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates."<ref name="hiatt">{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060703003128/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | url-status = dead | archive-date = July 3, 2006 | title = Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = June 20, 2006 | access-date = March 3, 2009 }}</ref>

Vedder began incorporating social commentary and political criticism into his lyrics and performances early in his career with Pearl Jam. He usually comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy. During Pearl Jam's 1992 appearance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', Vedder stood atop his stool, took out a marker pen, and wrote "[[pro-choice]]" down his arm in large letters when the band performed the song "Porch". During Pearl Jam's 2007 [[Lollapalooza]] headlining show, Vedder and the band played a song telling the crowd in Chicago to boycott the oil company [[BP|B.P. Amoco]] because they had been polluting [[Lake Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/pearl-jam/30173 |title=Pearl Jam Close Out Last Night at Lollapalooza |access-date=April 25, 2009 |publisher=[[NME]] |date=August 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430120637/http://www.nme.com/news/pearl-jam/30173 |archive-date=April 30, 2009 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Vedder attended San Dieguito High School, now called [[San Dieguito Academy]]. Vedder donated proceeds from a 2006 Pearl Jam concert in San Diego toward the construction of a theater for the school in the name of his former drama teacher, Clayton E. Liggett. Liggett was Vedder's mentor in high school. Vedder wrote the song "Long Road" (from ''[[Merkin Ball]]'') upon hearing of Liggett's death in 1995.<ref>Varga, George.

Vedder was a close friend of the late [[Soundgarden]] and [[Audioslave]] frontman, [[Chris Cornell]]. Aside from Vedder's Pearl Jam bandmates, Cornell was one of the first people Vedder met after moving to Seattle in 1990.

In the 2009 book ''Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music'', Soundgarden manager [[Susan Silver]] recalled that Cornell carried Vedder onstage on his shoulders at Pearl Jam's second show in Seattle (the band was known as Mookie Blaylock at the time): "Everyone was still reeling from [Andrew Wood]'s death... The band came on and Chris carried Eddie onto the stage – he was on his shoulders. It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world – in terms of people in Seattle – and [[Malfunkshun]] and [[Mother Love Bone]] were loved bands.
