'''Esther Renay Dean'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/esterdean/status/543588633438326785|title=Miss Ester Dean on Twitter}}</ref> (born April 15, 1986)<ref>{{cite web |title=Ester Dean Interview at The Breakfast Club |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3p2hrf |website=dailymotion.com}}</ref> is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Dean has also written [[List of songs written by Ester Dean|songs for many artists]], with numerous Top 10 hits, including No. 1 hits for [[Rihanna]] and [[Katy Perry]], earning the name "The Song Factory". At the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards]], Dean was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] as a producer on [[Rihanna]]'s album ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]''. Outside of music, she voiced two of the characters in the fourth film in the ''Ice Age'' franchise, ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', and also wrote a song for the movie, entitled "We Are (Family)". Dean made her acting debut in the film ''[[Pitch Perfect]]'' (2012) as Cynthia-Rose Adams, a role she reprised for the sequels, ''[[Pitch Perfect 2]]'' (2015) and ''[[Pitch Perfect 3]]'' (2017).

==Life and career==
Born in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], and raised in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Ester Dean is the youngest of five children brought up by their single mother Hester, in a low-income household.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ester Dean Talks Debut Album & 'Pitch Perfect' Success|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/1485717/ester-dean-talks-debut-album-pitch-perfect-success|website = Billboard|access-date = 2015-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Oklahoma Today - SO12 - Melody Maker|url = http://www.oklahomatoday.com/oklahomatoday/MAGAZINE/Roots/SO12_-_Melody_Maker.html|website = www.oklahomatoday.com|access-date = 2015-11-11}}</ref>  At a young age Dean learned how to channel her energy into her music, writing and channeling her emotions into songs. Creative writing served as Dean’s self-therapy.
<ref name="blogcritics.org">{{Cite web|title = Interview: Ester Dean – Singer and Songwriter|url = http://blogcritics.org/interview-ester-dean-singer-and-songwriter/|website = Blogcritics|access-date = 2015-11-11}}</ref>  The separation made Dean dig deeper for a connection, finding solace in music and the local music scene.  Singing in every studio, writing for local rappers and producers, Dean unknowingly grass-rooted herself.<ref name="blogcritics.org"/><ref>{{Cite web|title = Ester Dean: Artists To Watch 2010|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959729/ester-dean-artists-to-watch-2010|website = Billboard|access-date = 2015-11-11}}</ref>  Learning the ins and outs of her talent and creativity, at 20 years old Dean made a bold move and left Oklahoma with only $500 in her pocket.  She drove 18 hours, alone, to [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] with dreams of breaking into the music industry.<ref name="blogcritics.org"/>  She sang for anyone who would listen.  While at a [[The Gap Band|Gap Band]] concert, music producer [[Tricky Stewart]] overheard Dean singing in the crowd along with the band.<ref name=SongMachine>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/03/26/120326fa_fact_seabrook?currentPage=2 |last=Seabrook |first=John |title=The Song Machine |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2012-03-26 |volume=LXXXVIII |issue=6 |pages=48–55 |access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref> He immediately asked her to set up a meeting. While going through her catalog of songs, Tricky was impressed by not only her voice but also her songwriting ability.  He signed her to a small publishing deal that allowed Dean to grow and connect with other known writers and producers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ester Dean Songwriter Interview {{!}} Writing Hits for Rihanna, Katy Perry|url = http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ester-dean-123.htm|website = Songwriter Universe {{!}} Songwriting News, Articles & Song Contest|date = 4 December 2013|access-date = 2015-11-11|language = en-US}}</ref>  This opportunity provided Dean with the tools, tricks, and skills to writing potential Top 40 songs.

Although her time with Tricky was a significant point in her career, Dean eventually parted ways and relocated to [[Los angeles, california|Los Angeles, California]].

Upon relocating to Los Angeles, Dean began to build a name in the songwriting world.  She was eventually introduced to [[Polow da Don]], and later signed to [[Zone 4 (record label)|Zone 4 Records]]/[[Interscope Records]].<ref name=SongMachine/>

In 2009 Dean released her first single, "[[Drop It Low (Ester Dean song)|Drop It Low]]", which peaked at number 38 on the US ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'', becoming her first US Top 40 single.

Dean's big break came when she collaborated with super producers [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]], creating her first number one single, Rihanna’s "[[Rude Boy (Rihanna song)|Rude Boy]]".  She went on to write "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name]]", "[[Where Have You Been]]" and several other Rihanna hits, as well as Katy Perry's "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]" and Nicki Minaj’s "[[Super Bass]]" and co-writing "[[Pills n Potions]]" with Nicki Minaj.

In 2011, Dean contributed to the soundtrack for the animated film, ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' by [[Blue Sky Studios]].

In 2012, Dean was named ‘The Song Machine’ in an article by [[John Seabrook]].<ref name=SongMachine/> She has written, and sometimes produced, Top 40 hits for scores of artists, including: [[Rihanna]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Florence + The Machine]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Ciara]], [[The Pussycat Dolls]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[Kelly Rowland]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Lil Wayne]], and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]] winner [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]].

After making a great impression in the voice-over world, Dean was asked to audition for a small part in a film about a female A cappella group. She landed the role, Cynthia Rose in the hit movie ''[[Pitch Perfect]]'' (2012), which led to her co-starring in the sequels ''[[Pitch Perfect 2]]'' (2015) and ''[[Pitch Perfect 3]]'' (2017).

==Artistry==
===Voice===
Dean possesses a [[mezzo-soprano]] range. Her vocals were described by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as "raw, energetic vocals [that] cover a wide range: from club banger to melodic doo-wop/hip-hop."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959729/ester-dean-artists-to-watch-2010 |title=Ester Dean: Artists To Watch 2010 |publisher=Billboard |access-date=2014-05-19}}</ref> Dean's vocals have also been described as similar to [[Rihanna]] and [[Nicki Minaj]]. "The songwriter's voice is pitched dead center between two artists. The first is frequent collaborator Rihanna...the other is Nicki Minaj when she sings."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popdust.com/2012/02/23/ester-dean-nicki-minaj-gimme-money-new-song-review/ |title=The Singles Bar: Ester Dean ft. Nicki Minaj, "Gimme Money" |publisher=Popdust |date=2012-02-23 |access-date=2014-05-19}}</ref>

===Songwriting style===
In a 2012 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Dean described her preferred method of songwriting: "I go into the booth and I scream and I sing and I yell, and sometimes it's words but most time [sic] it's not...and I just see when I get this little chill [on her upper arm, below the shoulder] and then I'm, like, 'Yeah, that's the hook.'"<ref name=SongMachine/>
