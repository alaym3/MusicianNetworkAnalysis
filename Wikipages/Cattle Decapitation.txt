==History==
{{ods
|date=May 2020}}
Founded in 1996, Cattle Decapitation's songs protest the [[Cruelty to animals|mistreatment]] and consumption of animals, the [[Human impact on the environment|abuse of the environment]] and touch subjects such as [[misanthropy]] and [[genocide]] of the human race. Much of the band's music is based on putting humans in the situations that animals are subjected to, for example animal testing, slaughter, etc. While the band started with an entirely [[vegan]] lineup, only two current members are vegetarian, namely Travis Ryan and Josh Elmore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/cattle-decapitation-vegetarian-death-metal/Content?oid=1357700#.UtWX6WRDsyo|title=Cattle Decapitation: vegetarian death metal|work=NUVO|access-date=January 3, 2015|archive-date=January 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103215438/http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/cattle-decapitation-vegetarian-death-metal/Content?oid=1357700#.UtWX6WRDsyo|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/07/06/cattle-decapitations-travis-ryan-the-metalsucks-interview/|title=CATTLE DECAPITATION'S TRAVIS RYAN: THE METALSUCKS INTERVIEW|first=Metal|last=Matt|date=July 6, 2012|access-date=June 9, 2016|archive-date=May 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513213305/http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/07/06/cattle-decapitations-travis-ryan-the-metalsucks-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The 2002 album ''[[To Serve Man (album)|To Serve Man]]'' saw controversy in Germany, where distribution company SPV refused to handle the album due to its graphic cover.<ref name="Metal page 169">Metal: The Definitive Guide, page 169</ref> The cover of the 2004 album ''[[Humanure (album)|Humanure]]'', featuring a cow excreting human remains, was reportedly censored without permission from the label in some outlets. Record store owners did not display the album, making it difficult for customers to find and buy it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/bands/2008/nov/19/cattle-decapitation-veggie-burgers-plus-assassin-s/ |title=Cattle Decapitation Veggie Burgers, plus History of San Diego Music Parts 1 thru 7 |last1=Sanford |first1=Jay Allen |date=November 19, 2008 |website=sandiegoreader.com |publisher=San Diego Reader |access-date=December 9, 2008 |archive-date=December 28, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228000332/http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/bands/2008/nov/19/cattle-decapitation-veggie-burgers-plus-assassin-s/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Lyrical themes==
The band's lyrics are largely concerned with [[human impact on the environment]], the [[ethics of eating meat]] and [[animal rights]]. Ryan comments: "Josh and I are what you would call "[[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]". We've tried and tried to be as up front about that as possible but the entire media world thinks we are hardline [[Veganism|vegan]], which in turn trickled down to fans and we're just not. I've been vegan at points but I try to be as correct as possible and point blank, there's times on tour where I just don't know if what I've been given to eat has eggs or dairy in it and the road is rather unfriendly to us. We aren't afforded the luxury of going to a Whole Foods at 3 am after a show. At that point it's fucking Taco Bell or something disgusting. You're driving down the road burning fossil fuels and your vehicle is covered in the carcasses of insects and sometimes birds and other animals. So how far does one take it? This is why I can't claim vegan. I live my life with as much compassion as I can for others, the environment and the animals though. At home it's much easier."<ref>[https://www.moshville.co.uk/interview/2015/07/interview-travis-ryan-of-cattle-decapitation/ INTERVIEW: TRAVIS RYAN OF CATTLE DECAPITATION] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112020026/https://www.moshville.co.uk/interview/2015/07/interview-travis-ryan-of-cattle-decapitation/ |date=November 12, 2020 }}.
