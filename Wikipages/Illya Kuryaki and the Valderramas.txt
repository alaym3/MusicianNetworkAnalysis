'''Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas''' (IKV) is a musical duo formed in 1991 consisting of [[Dante Spinetta]] and [[Emmanuel Horvilleur]], from [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The duo split in 2001 to follow solo careers, but later performed together several times, and officially reunited in 2011.<ref name="RockArg" /> The duo took their name from a fictional character, the Soviet spy [[Illya Kuryakin]] in the hit 1960s TV show ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', and the [[Colombia]]n football player [[Carlos Valderrama (footballer)|Carlos Valderrama]]. Their musical style is extremely wide-ranging, including hip-hop, rock, funk, and salsa.<ref name="NYT20000814" />

==History==
The duo met as children as a result of the friendship between their parents. Spinetta is the son of musician [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]], and Horvilleur's father is photographer [[Eduardo Marti]].<ref name="NH19980507" /> In 1987, when they were 12 and 11 years old respectively, Spinetta, Horvilleur, and younger siblings formed a music group called Pechugo. Pechugo dissolved one year later, and the duo decided to form Illya Kuryaki and The Valderramas.<ref name="I20110830" />

'''''Fabrico cuero'' (1991–1992)'''

In 1991 they released their first album entitled ''Fabrico cuero'' (I make leather), which combines rap, synthesized sounds, catchy melodies and ironic lyrics. Although some in the media initially suggested their popularity came from their family connections rather than their musical skills, that changed when [[Charly García]] invited them to play at one of his shows to perform ''Fabrico cuero'' and ''Rap del exilio''. They shared the stage with Luis Alberto Spinetta in Venezuela. In 1991 they were voted as la Revelación (''best newcomers'') in the newspaper ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]''.<ref name="RockArg" />

'''''Horno para calentar los mares'' (1993–1994)'''

In 1993, sales allowed them their second album, ''Horno para calentar los mares'' (Oven to warm up the seas), much harder than the previous one, with a new record label, PolyGram. It contains ''No Way Jose'' and ''Virgen de riña''. The album was not widely distributed. It features [[Tweety González]].

'''''Chaco'' (1995)'''

With their savings they went on to record what would be their most successful album, [[Chaco (Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas album)|''Chaco'']]. They chose to create their own record label, Gigolo Productions. ''Chaco'' sold over 250,000 copies. The album was chosen by ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in Argentina as one of the best [[rock (music)|rock]] productions of the country. The single from the album, ''Abarájame'', received the Latin MTV Award for Best Latin MTV Video of the Year in 1996.<ref name="I20110830" /> According to band members "''Chaco'' is a summary of what happened to us musically and socially in recent times. The record suggests a new state of mind in which there is no place for discrimination or oppression." The name comes from [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], which is one of the few provinces in Argentina where [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginals]] still live. At this point they began to show their love of [[martial arts]] in their videos.

'''''MTV Unplugged Ninja Mental'' (1996)'''

They performed different versions of well-known songs and included two new ones which became part of their next album, ''Versus''.

'''''Versus'' (1997–1998)'''

Working in the U.S., they recorded their fifth studio album at Ocean Recording Studios, Burbank, and Battery Studios, New York, leaning more to [[soul music]] and [[funk music]]. It was mastered at Sony Studios, New York and mixed at Battery Studios, New York. The first cut was "Expedición al Klama Hama". In 1998, the album's second cut, "Jugo", was nominated for best group video and best alternative video at the MTV Latino Music Awards.<ref name="B19990911" /> The album includes rock, funk, hip hop and ballads.

'''''Leche'' (1999–2000)'''

''Leche'' (''Milk'') was influenced by African-American music and funk. The album features bass player [[Bootsy Collins]], who introduces himself saying, "My name is Bootsy Collins, old woman!" ''Leche'' was nominated for Best Rock Album at the first annual Latin Grammy Awards (eligibility year of Jan. 1, 1999, through March 31, 2000).<ref name="MH20000708" />

'''''Kuryakistan'' (2001–2002)'''

This album includes new versions of old tracks, remixes and hits of their career, plus four new tracks. The death of the duo's friend and manager [[José Luis Miceli]], who died in a car crash in early 2000<ref name="DRS2000" /> had a big impact on them. The album was dedicated to him and included the songs ''A-dios'' and ''Hermano'' as a personal homage, as well as a cover version of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s classic song "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]".  A ''[[New York Times]]'' article considered the music to be "surreal poetry, full of rebelliousness, death and raunchy transfiguration", and mentioned that in the lyrics of ''Jennifer del Estero'', "[[Jennifer Lopez]] leaves her derriere in the singer's freezer."<ref name="NYT20000814" />

===Split===
The band split after 11 years in 2001.<ref name="Gaitán" /> Both Dante and Emmanuel continued solo performing careers. Emmanuel focused on a rock and pop-rock sound, while Dante preferred hip-hop.

They played on stage together at the [[Vive Latino|Vive Latino Festival]] 2008.<ref name="I20110830" /> On 24 April 2009, they also reunited as the opening act of the Puerto Rican duo [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]] at the [[Estadio G.E.B.A.|G.E.B.A. stadium]] in Buenos Aires.<ref name=I20110830 />

===Reunited===
'''''Chances'' (2012-2014)'''

They officially reunited in 2011.<ref name="I20110830" /> They participated in the musical festival ''Mundo Invisible'' in December 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mundoinvisible.com/2011/11/%C2%A1se-viene-el-festival-solidario-mundo-invisible |title=Festival Solidario Mundo Invisible (Nov 18, 2011) |access-date=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120703013149/http://www.mundoinvisible.com/2011/11/¡se-viene-el-festival-solidario-mundo-invisible/ |archive-date=July 3, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Chances'' was released by Sony in 2012, and includes the song "Águila Amarilla", for Dante's father, [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]], who died during the recording of the album.<ref name="iTunes" />
