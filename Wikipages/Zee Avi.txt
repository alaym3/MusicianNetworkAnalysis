===Breakthrough===
In September 2007, Avi posted a video of her first song, "Poppy" on YouTube for one of her friends who had missed her first performance in Kuala Lumpur.

This inspired her to put more videos on YouTube.<ref name="FuelFriendsInterview" />

Several months later, on the eve of her 22nd birthday, Avi posted what was supposed to be her final video "No Christmas For Me". The next day, YouTube put the spotlight on her video and Avi's mailbox was bombarded with more than 3,000 e-mails and a slew of offers from record labels.<ref>[http://roadtripnation.com/leader/zee-avi Zee's Open Road]</ref>
