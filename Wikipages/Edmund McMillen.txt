==Early life==
McMillen has been a lifelong resident of [[Santa Cruz, California]].<ref name="IndieGameTheMovie">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpnUIyAk498 |title=IndieGame: The Movie "Growing Up Edmund" |publisher=IndieGameTheMovie via YouTube |access-date=2010-12-18 |date=2010-05-18}}</ref> He went to school at Soquel High School.<ref>{{Cite web|title = MetroActive Features {{!}} Santa Cruz Artists to Watch|url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/05.05.99/5art-9918.html|website = www.metroactive.com|access-date = 2015-10-06}}</ref> He is fond of drawing, his favorite subject being monsters.<ref name="IndieGameTheMovie"/> McMillen spent most of his childhood with his grandmother, whom he considers to be the greatest source of support in his creative endeavors. Later in his life, McMillen received a box from his grandmother that contained all of his drawings as a child. Many of these drawings can be seen by unlocking The Box in one of his games, ''[[The Basement Collection]]''.<ref name="IndieGameTheMovie"/> His childhood represents his own game creations, more specifically ''[[The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth]]''. In an interview with ''[[Indie Game: The Movie]]'' he explains that his family was consistently riddled with alcohol and drug addiction, as well as being “born again” [[Christians]]. He was confronted by this extreme faith, which caused him religious guilt and mental problems causing him to grow a desire to fight back, resulting in his acting out against them.

==Career==
McMillen's initial graphic work was in independent comics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=514436 |title=10 Years of Independent Art on CD from Edmund McMillen |publisher=gamedev.net |first=Drew |last=Sikora |date=2008-11-10 |access-date=2010-12-18 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2008/08/interview_edmund_mcmillen_part.html |title=Interview: Edmund McMillen, Part 2 |date=2008-08-28 |access-date=2010-12-18 |publisher=indiegames.com |author=timw |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915165829/http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2008/08/interview_edmund_mcmillen_part.html |archive-date=2008-09-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While he has largely abandoned this field in favor of video games, he has released a series of comics featuring Meat Boy, the title character in the video game ''[[Super Meat Boy]]'', as a promotional tie-in for the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/28/exclusive-the-new-super-meat-boy-comic/ |title=Exclusive: The new Super Meat Boy comic |publisher=Joystiq |access-date=2010-12-18 |date=2009-09-28 |first=Justin |last=McElroy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505072555/http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/28/exclusive-the-new-super-meat-boy-comic |archive-date=2010-05-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  His most well-known games are the Flash-based game ''Meat Boy'', and its sequel ''Super Meat Boy'', which has been released for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4.

=== ''The Binding of Isaac'' ===
''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' is an [[Indie game|indie]] [[roguelike]] video game designed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, initially released in 2011 for [[Microsoft Windows]]; the game was later ported for [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] operating systems. The game's title and plot are inspired by the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of the [[Binding of Isaac]]. In the game, Isaac's mother receives a message from [[God]] demanding the life of her son as proof of her [[faith]], and Isaac flees into the monster-filled basement of their home where he must fight to survive. Players control Isaac or one of six other unlockable characters through a [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] dungeon in a roguelike manner, fashioned after those of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', defeating monsters in real-time combat while collecting items and power-ups to defeat [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] and eventually Isaac's mother.

The game was the result of a week-long game jam between McMillen and Himsl to develop a ''The Legend of Zelda''-inspired roguelike that allowed McMillen to showcase his feelings about both positive and negative aspects of religion that he had come to discover from conflicts between his Catholic and [[born again]] Christian family members while growing up. McMillen had considered the title a risk but one he could take after the financial success of ''[[Super Meat Boy]]'', and released it without much fanfare to [[Steam (service)|Steam]] in September 2011, not expecting many sales. The game soon gained popularity partially as a result of various [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos showcasing the title. McMillen and Himsl released an expansion "Wrath of the Lamb" in May 2012, but were limited from further expansion due to limitations with the [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] platform. They had started working with [[Nintendo]] in 2012 to release a [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] version, but Nintendo later backed out of the deal, citing controversy over the game's religious themes.

Developer [[Nicalis]] worked with McMillen in 2014 to complete a remake of the game, ''[[The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth]]'', bringing additional features that McMillen had planned that exceeded Flash's limitation, as well as to improve the game's graphics and enable ports for other systems beyond personal computers, including [[PlayStation 4]] and [[PlayStation Vita|Vita]], [[Xbox One]], [[Wii U]], [[Nintendo 3DS]], and the [[Nintendo Switch]].

=== ''The End is Nigh'' ===
''[[The End Is Nigh (video game)|The End Is Nigh]]'' is a [[Platform game|platform]] [[Adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]] developed by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel. The game was released on July 12, 2017 on [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (service)|Steam]]. Ports of the game were released on August 15, 2017 on [[macOS]] and on December 12, 2017 for [[Linux]] and [[Nintendo Switch]], with a port for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[PlayStation Vita]] in development. The game has been described as a spiritual successor to McMillen's ''[[Super Meat Boy]]''.
