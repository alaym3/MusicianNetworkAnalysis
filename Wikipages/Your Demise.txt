'''Your Demise''' are a British [[hardcore punk]] band from [[St Albans]], England, formed in 2003. They shared stages and toured worldwide with the likes of [[Comeback Kid (band)|Comeback Kid]], [[Basement (band)|Basement]], [[Trapped Under Ice]], [[Man Overboard (band)|Man Overboard]], [[Enter Shikari]], [[Parkway Drive]], [[A Day to Remember]] and [[Bring Me the Horizon]]. On 22 September 2008, the band confirmed that they had signed a deal with [[Visible Noise]]. The band played their final gig at The London Underworld on 15 March 2014, after announcing in 2013 that they would be parting ways in March. They reunited for a one off benefit show for [[The Ghost Inside (band)|The Ghost Inside]] in 2015. They reunited again for the anniversary of The Kids We Used to Be but the shows were postponed due to the COVID-19 situation.

==History==
The band was formed in 2003 with them playing shows at their local St Albans youth club, [[The Pioneer Club]].<ref>https://www.pioneerclub.co.uk/?page_id=3762</ref> Various demos and EPs were recorded and handed out for free over the next couple of years until ''You Only Make Us Stronger'' was recorded and self-released by the band. This was followed by ''[[The Blood Stays on the Blade]]'', released by Thirty Days of Night Records in 2008. 

Your Demise recorded their [[Visible Noise]] debut between 16 November 2008 and 13 January 2009 at Outhouse Studios in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], England. The band released their second album ''[[Ignorance Never Dies]]'' in April 2009. The band embarked on a 3-week tour of Europe and the UK, starting 20 April 2009, with [[Deez Nuts (band)|Deez Nuts]], More Than Life and [[Lower Than Atlantis]]. The band then signed with [[Earache Records]] in North America, and with [[Shock Records]] in Australia.

Since the release of ''Ignorance Never Dies'', the band split from vocalist George Noble and recruited former Centurion frontman Ed McRae. Shortly afterward, Your Demise toured the UK and Europe with [[Misery Signals]] in August and September 2009 and then continued to tour Scandinavia with [[Raised Fist]] in early October, followed by a European run with The Devil Wears Prada.

The band finished recording their third album on 16 June 2010. It was released on 20 September in the UK, Japan and Europe. In the U.S. it was released on 25 October. The album is called ''The Kids We Used to Be'' and they showcased some of the new songs at Download Festival 2010 and have been playing them on tour since.

On 6 September 2011 the band announced via Facebook that their fourth album will be called ''[[The Golden Age (Your Demise album)|The Golden Age]]''. On 4 January 2012, the release date was confirmed as 26 March 2012, along with details of guest vocalists.<ref name=RS>{{cite web|title=Your Demise Announce Details Of 'The Golden Age'|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/your-demise-announce-details-of-the-golden-age|publisher=Rock Sound|access-date=4 January 2012|date=4 January 2012}}</ref>

On 7 February, the band released their new EP Cold Chillin', a 4 track follow up to ''The Golden Age'', and their first release since parting ways with [[Visible Noise]]. Karma was the lead single, which was released as a free download and a video was made for it.
The EP was released on CD via [[Impericon]] and a hand-numbered 7" through Pinky Swear Records limited to 500 copies over two colourways and alternative artworks.

On 15 April 2013, the band announced, via a YouTube video posted to their Facebook/Twitter page, that they were to break up. The decision was amicable and based on the fact that they felt they had taken the band as far as they believed was possible. The band will "come to an end in March 2014, following a series of farewell performances (details of which will be announced in the near future)." The band also announced that they would no longer be able to perform their scheduled dates in Mexico, North America and Canada. On 14 March 2014, the band started a two night farewell show at [[Camden Underworld]], [[London]], ending with a set on 15 March 2014.  The band have now split amicably as they felt that they had taken the band as far as they believed was possible.

On 30 April 2014, it was announced that original vocalist George Noble was reforming a line-up of the band to tour, and they will be performing songs from the first two albums and all demos and EPs, under the name of 'Your Demise 2004'.
