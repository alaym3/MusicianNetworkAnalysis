'''Kenneth Keith Downing Jr.''' (born 27 October 1951) is an English  musician. He is a co-founder and former guitarist of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]].

==Early life and career==
Downing was born in [[West Bromwich]], West Midlands . In the late 1960s, Downing developed a passion for rock music and the guitar, which led to his being kicked out of his home at age 15 and dropping out of school soon afterwards.<ref name=biography>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://kkdowning.net/kkdowning/biography.html|access-date=2 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120704/http://kkdowning.net/kkdowning/biography.html|archive-date=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He is a mostly self-taught guitarist.<ref name=guitarhoo>{{cite web|title=K.K.

Downing started his first band, a pop band called Stagecoach,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heavy Duty|last=Downing|first=K.K.|year=2018|pages=52}}</ref> between the age of 17 and 18 with his second cousin Brian Badhams on bass guitar (now with The [[Elkie Brooks]] Band) and drummer Martin Philips. The trio "mainly jammed a few Cream songs and a few 12-bar blues". Downing played guitar with the band after winning a coin toss with Badhams "in his bedroom to see who would play guitar or bass".<ref name="guitarhoo"/>K.K.

==Playing style and technique==
[[File:K. K. Downing 1980.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Downing in 1980]]
Downing has an aggressive, rock-influenced guitar style featuring solos and dual leads with fellow Judas Priest guitarist [[Glenn Tipton]].<ref>[http://members.firstinter.net/markster/PROFILE2.html Judas Priest Info Pages – K.K. – Glenn Profile<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914102903/http://members.firstinter.net/markster/PROFILE2.html |date=14 September 2008 }}</ref> His solos remained of this style for most of his career, but he incorporated various techniques into his playing over the years. As opposed to Tipton, his solos tended to incorporate a more raw, rough-edged sound, making use of techniques such as [[pinch harmonic]]s, [[Dive bomb (guitar technique)|dive bomb]]s, and [[Alternate picking|tremolo picking]], and often focusing on speed, technical accuracy and melody. From ''[[Stained Class]]'' onward, Tipton became increasingly dominant in Judas Priest's songwriting, particularly on the more commercial tracks while Downing's role in the band started to diminish, especially as Tipton's songs comprised the vast majority of the band's live setlists after 1980. In 1978, Tipton began to incorporate the [[tapping]] technique into his playing, which Downing began to use as well. By 1990, both Tipton and Downing started to use the complex technique of [[sweep-picking]], which can be notably heard on the [[Painkiller (Judas Priest song)|title track]] of their 1990 album ''[[Painkiller (Judas Priest album)|Painkiller]]''. They have  used these techniques ever since.

==Leaving Judas Priest==
[[File:K. K. Downing.jpg|thumb|right|Downing in 1984]]
Downing officially left Judas Priest on 20 April 2011, citing "an on-going breakdown in working relationships between myself, elements of the band and management for some time." He stated that there were at least "21 reasons" why he left, but refused to go into specific detail;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarhoo.com/interviews/kk-downing-93|title=K.K.

Soon after Glenn Tipton announced his [[Parkinson's disease]] diagnosis and his self-imposed retirement from touring in February 2018,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/12/judas-priest-glenn-tipton-parkinsons-disease |title=Judas Priest's Glenn Tipton diagnosed with Parkinson's disease |last=Snapes |first=Laura |website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=2018-02-12 |access-date=2018-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921052817/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/12/judas-priest-glenn-tipton-parkinsons-disease |archive-date=21 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Downing said that he was "shocked and stunned" that he wasn't approached to rejoin Judas Priest and was "officially and legally still a member of Judas Priest", despite not being present in the band. He felt that he made the right choice to leave when he did and that his time in the band and value in terms of crafting their legacy "was and is unappreciated by more than one member". He said that the decision of not being approached "was not a financial one".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/news/2018-02-27/kk-downing-shocked-that-judas-priest-didnt-ask-him-to-replace-glenn-tipton|title=KK Downing "shocked" that Judas Priest didn't ask him to replace Glenn Tipton |author=Munro, Scott|work=Team Rock |access-date=26 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228023801/http://teamrock.com/news/2018-02-27/kk-downing-shocked-that-judas-priest-didnt-ask-him-to-replace-glenn-tipton|archive-date=28 February 2018|url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Faulkner and Halford spoke in regards to his statement.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/articles/richie-faulkner-judas-priest-guest-goldmine-magazine-podcast-episode-22|title=Richie Faulkner of Judas Priest is the guest on the Goldmine Magazine Podcast, Episode 22|magazine=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|access-date=28 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328234058/http://www.goldminemag.com/articles/richie-faulkner-judas-priest-guest-goldmine-magazine-podcast-episode-22|archive-date=28 March 2018|url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dailynews.com/music/2018/04/06/interview-rob-halford-judas-priest-firepower-album-sets-record-straight/?doing_wp_cron=1524076392.7310199737548828125000|author=Elias, Paty |title=Interview with Rob Halford of Judas Priest who talks about new 'Firepower' album and setting the record straight. |date=6 April 2018 |publisher=blogs.dailynews.com |access-date=6 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422083124/http://blogs.dailynews.com/music/2018/04/06/interview-rob-halford-judas-priest-firepower-album-sets-record-straight/?doing_wp_cron=1524076392.7310199737548828125000|archive-date=22 April 2018|url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/why-did-k-k-downing-leave-judas-priest-rob-halford-responds/|title=Why Did K.K.

ROB HALFORD Responds|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=29 April 2021|accessdate=29 April 2021}}</ref> Downing recalled the conflicts that occurred in the winter of 2010, and would then reconsider his departure a few months later, which is not mentioned in his autobiography. After speaking to bassist Ian Hill about the change, he received the setlist for the dubbed farewell tour, only to find out that his announcement to retire from the band was made public the next day, prompting him to send in his angry second letter. Downing felt that he never left Judas Priest and was orchestrated for him to not be there.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/k-k-downing-believes-his-exit-from-judas-priest-was-orchestrated-i-dont-really-feel-as-though-i-left-the-band/|title=K.K.

Downing stated that he never retired from the music industry, detailing about being encouraged to perform on the farewell tour by a friend and being ridiculed by the fans about his announcement. After guitarist Glenn Tipton's dismissal from touring, Downing expected an opening for him to return, but was never notified. He said essentially the band is performing his songs and that if they can call themselves "Priest", he felt the need to be a Priest as well and be able to perform his songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/k-k-downing-when-glenn-tipton-retired-i-fully-expected-that-that-would-be-the-opening-for-me-to-return-to-judas-priest/|title=K.K.

He said that he wasn't ready to perform on the farewell tour due to his issues that occurred during the [[Metal Masters Tour]], saying that the band wasn't tight and felt that they weren't the same band as they were in their prime. He regretted sending in the retirement letter and not believing anything he wrote. He sighted the second letter, telling the band to ignore everything written and explaining the reasons why he left, but the band preferred to tell the content of the first letter instead, in which he told the band to ignore what he wrote as misinformation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/k-k-downing-didnt-believe-a-word-of-what-he-wrote-in-his-first-judas-priest-resignation-letter/|title=K.K.

When speaking about the difference on working with Tipton in Judas Priest to working with guitarist A.J. Mills in his band KK's Priest, Downing said that he felt that he didn't have his fair share in lead work in Judas Priest as he should have.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/k-k-downing-didnt-really-feel-as-though-he-had-his-fair-share-of-lead-guitar-work-in-judas-priest/|title=K.K.

===Future===
Downing's relationship with Judas Priest isn't "overly sweet at the moment. Nothing lasts forever. I started in the late '60s, so certainly guys from that time, we're not going to be around forever. Obviously, we're losing a lot of good friends along the way. It is the way it is." An opportunity existed for him to return to the band, "and that has passed on." He expressed uncertainty if there would ever be another opportunity for him to rejoin, but did not dismiss it in the future.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/k-k-downing-doesnt-rule-out-return-to-judas-priest/|title=K.K.

==Autobiography==
On 18 September 2018, Downing published his autobiography titled ''Heavy Duty: Days and Nights in Judas Priest'' via [[Da Capo Press]]. It was written by Downing himself along with Mark Eglinton. The memoir details everything from "the complex personality conflicts, the business screw-ups, the acrimonious relationship with fellow heavy metal band [[Iron Maiden]], as well as how Judas Priest found itself at the epicenter of a storm of parental outrage that targeted heavy metal in the '80s", according to the book's synopsis. It also tells about Downing's role in Judas Priest, as well as his decision to leave the band in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/k-k-downing-to-release-heavy-duty-days-and-nights-in-judas-priest-memoir/|author=Divita, Joe|title=K.K.

==Homes==
Downing's first house was a "tiny semi in [[Bloxwich]]".

In December 2013, it was announced that Downing would be teaming up with a property development finance provider, and golfer [[Darren Clarke]], to help build luxury residential developments on Downing's Astbury estate.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2014/01/11/rocker-kk-downing-bids-to-bring-top-golf-contests-to-shropshire/ |title=Rocker KK Downing bids to bring top golf contests to Shropshire " Shropshire Star |newspaper=[[Shropshire Star]] |date=11 January 2014 |access-date=2014-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113191910/http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2014/01/11/rocker-kk-downing-bids-to-bring-top-golf-contests-to-shropshire/ |archive-date=13 January 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Dominic Walsh |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/columnists/article3970685.ece |title=City Diary: high priest of golf gets a partner |newspaper=The Times |date=10 January 2014 |access-date=2014-05-18}}</ref>

Downing told the ''[[Shropshire Star]]'': "We have had a fantastic season, things were going really well. We had plans for a hotel that we were doing really well with. Obviously there was a necessity for a funding element.
"The company took out a short-term mezzanine fund in early August to take us through to March. This was essentially to bring in professional architects and a team from London. Everything was in place as far as we were concerned.
"Unfortunately about six weeks into the loan we were served a loan termination notice about technical breaches of the agreement.
"We are at the moment looking to re-finance that loan. We were taken aback that the funder was not more flexible with us as partners.
It was put up for sale for £10 million ($13.5 million). Downing maintained that the development was financially stable and viable as he was set to build a luxury hotel for the Marriott Autograph collection and had hoped to host [[The Open Championship]] on the estate's golf course.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/10million-stately-home-golf-course-11328259|title=£10million stately home and golf course owned by Judas Priest rocker has gone into administration|author=Jones, Tamlyn|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|access-date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013134731/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/10million-stately-home-golf-course-11328259|archive-date=13 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Due to the circumstances surrounding his golf resort investment, Downing placed a share of his royalty rights for 136 Judas Priest songs for sale; the catalogue generates nearly £300,000 ($400,000) per year. Joint administrator Alastair Massey called the songs "a unique investment opportunity" from one of the "driving influences" of Judas Priest's success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kk-downing-judas-priest-songs/|author=Deriso, Nick|title=KK DOWNING IS SELLING HIS SHARE OF JUDAS PRIEST'S CATALOG|publisher=[[Townsquare Media|Ultimate Classic Rock]]|access-date=17 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518042604/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kk-downing-judas-priest-songs/|archive-date=18 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In July 2018, [[Round Hill Music]] acquired the royalty rights to Downing's compositions; the catalogue's asking price was at least £10 million ($13.5 million).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/8466210/round-hill-acquires-share-of-judas-priest-catalog-including|author=Smirke, Richard|title=Round Hill Acquires Share Of Judas Priest Catalog, Including 'Breaking The Law' & 'Living After Midnight'|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=19 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719234014/https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/8466210/round-hill-acquires-share-of-judas-priest-catalog-including|archive-date=19 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://myglobalmind.com/2018/09/05/k-k-downing-of-judas-priest-on-his-new-book-heavy-duty-days-and-nights-in-judas-priest-there-was-something-about-being-in-priest-that-i-couldnt-walk-away-from/|title=K.K.

I made a few rubbish business moves, but I can't complain really because I did okay. Lots of musicians end up with nothing really, but I had an evaluation on the estate worth in excess of £13 million. Quite a few million pounds' worth of music royalties and other assets as well. I'm suing my lawyers for negligence."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8476155/judas-priest-kk-downing-book|title=K.K.
