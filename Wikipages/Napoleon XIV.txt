'''Jerrold "Jerry" Samuels''' (born May 3, 1938) is an American singer, songwriter and record producer.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=889}}</ref> Under the pseudonym '''Napoleon XIV''', he achieved [[one-hit wonder]] status with the [[Top 40|Top 5]] [[hit single|hit]] [[novelty song]] "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]" in 1966.<ref name="Larkin"/> Samuels has occasionally revisited the Napoleon XIV character to record other songs, usually comedy records with an insanity theme.

Under the name Scott David (his son's name), he co-wrote "As If I Didn't Know" with [[Larry Kusik]], a top 10 hit for [[Adam Wade (singer)|Adam Wade]] in 1961. Samuels also wrote "[[The Shelter of Your Arms]]", a top 20 hit for [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] in 1964.

==Biography==
Samuels began his recording career in 1956 when he cut the single "Puppy Love"/"The Chosen Few" for the [[Vik Records]] subsidiary of [[RCA Victor Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hB8EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22jerry+samuels%22+%2B+%22puppy+love%22&pg=PA52 |work=Billboard |page=52 |via=Google Books |date=March 31, 1956 |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |title= The Billboard - Reviews of New Pop Records}}</ref>
In 1966, Samuels concocted "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]" while working at [[Associated Recording Studios]] in New York. The public found out his true identity when [[Bruce Morrow|Cousin Brucie]] of [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] outed him. The record quickly climbed the charts, reaching the Top Ten nationally in just its third week on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 3 and sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> In the [[Cash Box Top 100]] the record even climbed to No. 1 for one week in its second week on the charts.

The success of the single inspired a Warner Bros. album of the same name in 1966 (reissued by [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]] in 1985), most of which continued with the mental illness theme (for example: "Bats In My Belfry" and "Split Level Head" which features different vocal parts in each stereo speaker).<ref name="Larkin"/> A second single of two recordings from that album was relatively unnoticed. His manager was [[Leonard Stogel]].

Currently,{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Samuels works as a singer and agent who books various performers. He works the [[Delaware Valley]] area.
