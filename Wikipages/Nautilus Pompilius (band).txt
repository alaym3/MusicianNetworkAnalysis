'''Nautilus Pompilius''' ({{lang-ru|Наутилус Помпилиус}}), sometimes nicknamed '''Nau''' ({{lang-ru|Нау}}), was an influential [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], and later [[Russia]]n, [[rock band]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHCAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA417&lpg=PA417#v=onepage&q&f=false Nautilus Pompilius] // Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Russian culture, 2013</ref> founded in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] in 1982 by [[Vyacheslav Butusov]] and [[Dmitry Umetsky]]. Butusov disbanded the group in 1997, after multiple successful albums and several different line-ups of the band.

== Name ==
The band was originally named "Ali-Baba and the Forty Thieves" ({{lang-ru|"Али-Баба и сорок разбойников"}}). In 1983, at the suggestion of the band's sound director, Andrei Makarov, the band's name was changed to ''Nautilus''. In 1985, under the initiative of Ilya Kormiltsev, the name was lengthened to Nautilus Pompilius to avoid confusion with other Russian rock bands that were also named Nautilus at the time, such as the Moscow group led by [[Evgeny Margulis]].

The band later elaborated on the name, saying "The band is named after the nudibranch mollusc, which is naturally beautiful and charming." {{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Nautilus pompilius is the scientific name of a species of [[cephalopod]] (mistakenly called a nudibranch by the band) commonly known as the [[Chambered Nautilus]].

== History ==

=== Founding ===
Vyacheslav Butusov and Dmitry Umetsky took the first steps towards forming Nautilus in the late 70's. At first, the band performed at small events, covering songs by foreign performers and famous native performers like [[Mashina Vremeni]] and [[Voskreseniye]]. The band was formed by Butusov and Umetsky while the two were students in the Sverdlovsk Institute of Architecture (now called [[Urals Academy of Architecture]]).
 
In 1982, the group made its first attempts to record its own songs. The band's first album, ''Pereyezd'' (Russian: Переезд),  was released in 1983. It included some songs which had been recorded in 1982, as well as new material. The album was strongly influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

=== Later ===
The band was active in various incarnations from 1983 to 1997. Nautilus was an influential band in the [[post-punk]], [[New wave music|new wave]] wing of [[Russian rock]] music and also a landmark of the "Ural rock" style with their philosophical lyrics. Some of their early hits are popularly associated with the [[Perestroika]] period. 

The band's music was prominently featured in the 1997 movie ''[[Brother (1997 film)|Brother]]'' (Russian: Брат). A version of their popular song, "Bound by One Chain" ("Скованные одной цепью") appeared in the 2008 film [[Stilyagi (film)|Stilyagi]]. The band hired English guitarist [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]] to produce their 1997 album ''Yablokitay'' ({{lang-ru|Яблокитай}}), on which Nelson also plays the guitar. 

Since the group disbanded, Vyacheslav Butusov has launched a successful solo career.

Even though Butusov composed most of the band's songs and wrote some of their lyrics, poet [[Ilya Kormiltsev]] was a key contributor as a songwriter and producer.
