Hosford has lived in [[London]], [[Lewes]], [[Manchester]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Tokyo]].

==Career==
===Early career===
Born and raised in [[Hawke's Bay]], New Zealand, Hosford started his first band "The Four Skins" (named by his father, Ade "because there are four skins on the drums")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lebonbon.fr/interview/apero-avec-connan-mockasin/|title=Apéro avec Connan Mockasin {{!}} le Bonbon|website=Lebonbon.fr|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402174401/https://www.lebonbon.fr/interview/apero-avec-connan-mockasin/|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/5984qq/connan-mockasin-filmed-a-melodrama-in-a-hollywood-hair-salon |title=connan mockasin filmed a melodrama in a hollywood hair salon |publisher=Vice |date=13 October 2018 |access-date=27 November 2021}}</ref> while attending Havelock North Intermediate School in 1995. 

In 2003, after moving to [[Wellington]], Hosford briefly played in a band called "The Hornery Stiffmen" (later to become a track title on "Please Turn Me Into The Snat"),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shop.phantasysound.co.uk/pages/connan-mockasin|title=Connan Mockasin {{!}} Artists|website=Shop.phantasysound.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> consisting of Blake Pryor ([[Bass guitar|bass]]) (who later appeared as an actor in "Bostyn 'n Dobsyn") and Christopher Chalmers ([[Drum kit|drums]]), before forming his principal New Zealand group "Connan And The Mockasins", named after Connan's interest in making his own shoes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11427271|title=Barkers Sundae Sessions: Connan Mockasin|date=2015-04-03|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> Playing alongside Connan were Ross Walker (upright [[Double bass|acoustic bass]]) and Seamus Ebbs ([[Drum kit|drums]]). It was with this band that Connan relocated to [[London]] in May 2006 after releasing their second [[Extended play|EP]] "Uuu It's Teasy".

===''Forever Dolphin Love'' (2010–2012)===
The first release to bear the name "Connan Mockasin" was the 2010 LP, "Please Turn Me Into The Snat", which was re-released as "Forever Dolphin Love" the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2010/06/album-review-connan-mockasin-please-turn-me-into-the-snat/|title=Album Review: Connan Mockasin – Please Turn Me into The Snat|date=22 June 2010|website=Consequenceofsound.net|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15716-forever-dolphin-love/|title=Connan Mockasin: Forever Dolphin Love Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref> This album saw a significant change in style to Connan's previous work, and has been described by critics as "fluid", "meandering and blissful", "seemingly effortless" and "mesmerising".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/connan-mockasin-forever-dolphin-love-49728|title=Connan Mockasin – Forever Dolphin Love|website=Thelineofbestfit.com|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref> In a conversation about why he made the album, Mockasin said "It was never meant to be released...It was just me being silly, really, and Mum forced me to do it."<ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/13/connan-mockasin-interview|title=Connan Mockasin: the contrarian|first=Ben|last=Arnold|date=13 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref> Recording took place in his home in Te Awanga.

It was at this stage Hosford put together an incarnation of the existing Connan Mockasin live band: [[Betchadupa|Matthew Eccles]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]), [[Nicholas Harsant]] ([[Bass guitar|bass]]), [[Late of the Pier|Sam Dust]] ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]) and [[Rory McCarthy (musician)|Rory McCarthy]] ([[Percussion instrument|percussion]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.urbanoutfitters.com/blog/connanmockasin?cm_re=Blog_Content-_-B4-_-connanmockasin|title=Urban Outfitters - Blog - UO Live: Connan Mockasin|website=Blog.urbanoutfitters.com|access-date=2016-03-19}}</ref>

===''Caramel'' (2013)===
[[File:Connan Mockasin (Haldern Pop Festival 2013) IMGP4436 smial wp.jpg|thumbnail|Mockasin at the [[Haldern Pop]] Festival in 2013]]
Mockasin and band toured with [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as her live band after Mockasin composed the song 'Out Of Touch' for her 2011 album [[Stage Whisper]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.because.tv/en/news/charlottegainsbourg-tour.html | title=Charlotte Gainsbourg "Stage Whisper" with Connan Mockasin | work=Because Music | date=21 March 2011 | access-date=5 November 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114145/http://www.because.tv/en/news/charlottegainsbourg-tour.html | archive-date=5 November 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Connan Mockasin toured with [[Radiohead]] in Australia and New Zealand throughout November 2012, playing sold-out shows in Auckland, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.because.tv/en/news/connanmockasin-radiohead.html | title=Connan Mockasin supporting Radiohead! | work=Because Music | date=3 April 2012 | access-date=5 November 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114332/http://www.because.tv/en/news/connanmockasin-radiohead.html | archive-date=5 November 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Mockasin announced the release of his second album, ''[[Caramel (album)|Caramel]]'' in September 2013. It was released the following November. Connan commented, "I wanted to make something simple. Something nice and relaxed. I liked the name, and the album just came up around that. It's what I felt like 'caramel' music would be." The album was recorded in a hotel room in Tokyo: "I know a few people in Japan. We'd have little sleepovers, a bit of fun, a few drinks and stuff. I liked the atmosphere. It was just a hotel room, two beds. It was nice."<ref name="auto"/> Critics have said it is an album which "demands patience",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18748-connan-mockasin-caramel/|title=Connan Mockasin: Caramel Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref> and one which leaves you feeling as though "time is being stretched".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dummymag.com/reviews/album-of-the-week-connan-mockasin-caramel|title=Album of the Week: Connan Mockasin - ‘Caramel’|first=Aimee|last=Cliff|website=Dummymag.com|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref> It featured singles "I'm The Man That Will Find You" and "Do I Make You Feel Shy?".

===''Jassbusters''  and ''Bostyn 'n Dobsyn'' (2018-2021)===
On August 15 2018, new music and tour dates appeared on Connan Mockasin's social media web-pages. "Con Conn Was Impatient" would mark the first release from upcoming album ''Jassbusters''. September 19th saw the release of "Charlotte's Thong" (also taken from ''Jassbusters'') whose namesake is rumoured to be Mockasin-collaborator [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/09/daily-dose-connan-mockasin-charlottes-thong.html|title=Daily Dose: Connan Mockasin, "Charlotte's Thong"|website=Pastemagazine.com|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref> ''Jassbusters'' was recorded in one week at Studio Ferber, Paris in August 2016, and was the first Connan Mockasin album to feature Mockasin's touring band ([[Nicholas Harsant]], [[Matthew Eccles]], Rory McCarthy).

''Jassbusters'' will accompany a five-part film written and directed by Connan called "Bostyn 'n Dobsyn", which took an alleged 20 years to develop, and reached its current form after a 10-day shoot in Los Angeles in July 2016.<ref name="spin.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/08/connan-mockasin-new-album-jassbusters-con-conn-was-impatient-video/|title=Connan Mockasin Announces New Album 'Jassbusters'|date=15 August 2018|website=Spin.com|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref><ref name="crash.fr">{{cite web|url=https://www.crash.fr/a-meeting-with-connan-mockasin/|title=A MEETING WITH CONNAN MOCKASIN - CRASH Magazine|date=19 June 2018|website=Crash.fr|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref> The film tells the story of Mr. Bostyn (Connan Tant Hosford), and his student J. Dobsyn ([[Blake Pryor]]), and features Connan and band playing as a band of music teachers. The first episode "Belly Bubble" was premiered at the Vista Theatre, Los Angeles before a concert by Jassbusters, followed by a Connan Mockasin performance.<ref name="spin.com"/>

In November 2021, Mockasin released a follow-up album, ''Jassbusters Two'', with a press release noting: "''Jassbusters Two'' finds Connan Mockasin once again fronting a fictional band of schoolteachers from the as yet mostly unseen daytime TV miniseries, ''Bostyn ‘n Dobsyn''. Recorded at Gary’s Electric Studio in Brooklyn, Mockasin, along with Jassbusters’ real-life counterparts (Nicholas Harsant on bass, Matthew Eccles on drums, and Rory McCarthy, aka Infinite Bisous, on rhythm guitar), freestyled across long live takes, weaving under, over, and straight through each other’s blurry riffs."
