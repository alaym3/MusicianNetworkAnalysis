In 2011, the band felt a large amount of pressure from their American record label, [[Artery Recordings]]. Initially trying to convince the band to move and base themselves in the United States, Bury Tomorrow's band members felt the label was trying to manipulate them and change them into something they were not by suggesting they should incorporate more [[electronic music|electronic]] elements into their style.<ref name="Rocksound 164"/>{{sfn|Alderslade|2013|p=71}}<ref name="K! 1473"/> While they rejected moving as they had little experience in the country; communication broke down between them and Artery Recordings and through a series of emails the band lost their North American and Japanese record label as well as their American agency.<ref name="Rocksound 164">{{cite magazine| last = Bird | first = Ryan | date = August 2012 | title = They Are Unstoppable |magazine= [[Rock Sound]] | issue = 164 |page=71 | publisher = Freeway Press | location = London | issn = 1465-0185}}</ref>{{sfn|Alderslade|2013|p=71}} The only person that remained in their team was their British agent, and she was quoted as saying: "Nobody wants to touch you. No bands even want to take us on tour."{{sfn|Alderslade|2013|p=71}} The band was so low on money that they could not even afford to go to the studio to record the album they had written in 2011.{{sfn|Alderslade|2013|p=71}} Their agent managed to get them performances at [[Slam Dunk Festival]] and [[Ghostfest]] in Leeds.<ref name="K! 1473"/> At this point Bury Tomorrow's members had such a lack of confidence in the band's future that they believed these would be their final shows.{{sfn|Alderslade|2013|p=71}}

Their performances at these festivals were met with a positive response from fans, which restored a lot of their lost confidence.{{sfn|Alderslade|2013|p=72}} At Ghostfest, Bury Tomorrow met their future band manager who suggested that they shelf the album they had been writing.

The band has referred to older metalcore bands as their primary source of influence, with ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' journalist Merlin Alderslade commenting on their style by saying "the quintet's blend of fierce, [[melodic death metal]]-inspired  {{sic|riffage}} and gloriously anthematic choruses was seen as of the crowning achievements of a new generation of metal bands that had been weaned on a diet of ''[[The End of Heartache]]'', ''[[Waking the Fallen]]'' and ''[[Reroute to Remain]]''."{{sfn|Alderslade|2013|p=71}} Prior to the release of their third album, ''[[Runes (album)|Runes]]'', Bury Tomorrow have said that it is going to be more technical, "old school" and in line with artists like [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]] and [[Killswitch Engage]] than their previous releases.<ref name="Front-183"/>
