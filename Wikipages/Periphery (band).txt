Since their [[Periphery (album)|self-titled debut]], the band has released an additional five albums: ''[[Periphery II: This Time It's Personal]]'', the double album ''[[Juggernaut: Alpha]]'' and ''[[Juggernaut: Omega|Omega]]'', ''[[Periphery III: Select Difficulty]]'' and ''[[Periphery IV: Hail Stan]]''. They've also released two EPs: ''Icarus EP'' and [[Clear (EP)|''Clear'']]. All Periphery material is self-produced by the members of the band.

== History ==
=== Formation and early line-up changes (2005&ndash;2009) ===
Periphery was formed in 2005 by guitarist Misha Mansoor, who slowly gained a reputation on the Internet via a regularly-updated [[Soundclick]] account, the [[Meshuggah]] and [[John Petrucci]] forums, and the sevenstring.org message boards. Before and during Periphery's tenure in the metal scene, Mansoor developed a reputation for doing his own audio production, the majority of which was performed with a home computer and a [[Pod (amp modeler)|Pod XT]]. Mansoor has continued to update his personal project, Bulb, often transferring songs between the two projects. Mansoor also continues to be involved in a number of other musical projects, including Haunted Shores,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarmessenger.com/news/haunted-shores-releases-passenger-announce-partial-lineup-of-vocalists/ |title=Guitar Messenger – Haunted Shores Releases 'Passenger' and 'My The Man', Announce Partial Lineup of Vocalists (updated) |publisher=Guitarmessenger.com }}</ref> Four Seconds Ago,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/foursecondsago |title=Four Seconds Ago|publisher=Myspace.com|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref> and of Man Not of Machine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://got-djent.com/article/man-not-machine-new-track-metal-gear |title=Of Man Not of Machine: new track 'Metal Gear' (updated) |publisher=got-djent.com |date=April 2, 2011 |access-date=October 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403024400/http://got-djent.com/article/man-not-machine-new-track-metal-gear |archive-date=April 3, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Periphery went through a number of lineup changes during its early history. Originally, Misha played drums and guitar in the band, but began scoping out local talent and found local drummer Jason S. Berlin, and then switched permanently to guitar. Berlin was planning to pursue interests in Los Angeles and was replaced upon departure by Travis Orbin. Between 2005 and 2009, Periphery worked with vocalists Jake Veredika,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=96765 |title=Divine Heresy: First Footage With New Touring Singer Available |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=May 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514124224/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=96765 |archive-date=May 14, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Casey Sabol<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarmessenger.com/interviews/misha-mansoor-interview-periphery/ |title=Guitar Messenger – Misha Mansoor Interview (Periphery) |author= Ivan Chopik |publisher=Guitarmessenger.com |date= April 24, 2010 }}</ref> and Chris Barretto,<ref>{{cite web|author=Vince Neilstein |url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/03/01/new-periphery-singer-sounds-like-the-old-periphery-singer-who-sounds-like-the-current-haunted-shores-singer-who-sounds-like/ |title=New Periphery Singer Sounds Like The Old Periphery Singer Who Sounds Like The Current Haunted Shores Singer Who Sounds Like… |publisher=MetalSucks |date= March 1, 2010 }}</ref> gradually moving from a [[Meshuggah]]-influenced sound to a more ambient, melodic sound, with a focus on innovative production.

Periphery has toured extensively since 2008, supporting artists including [[DevilDriver]], [[Dream Theater]], [[Emmure]], [[Veil of Maya (band)|Veil of Maya]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=121293 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120914105352/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=121293 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 14, 2012 |title=Devildriver, Emmure: 'Thrash And Burn Tour' Dates Announced |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= June 3, 2010 }}</ref> [[Animals as Leaders]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=51492 |title=Animals As Leaders To Support Veil of Maya on Tour - in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |date= December 23, 2009 }}</ref> [[God Forbid]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryansrockshow.com/php2/news/1516-kittie-god-forbid-confirm-tour-dates-gwen-stacy-and-periphery-support.html |title=Kittie, God Forbid Confirm Tour Dates, Gwen Stacy and Periphery Support |author= Ryan Minic |publisher=Ryansrockshow.com |date= January 14, 2010}}</ref> [[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/tour-dates/darkest-hour-announce-tour-veil-maya-periphery |title=Darkest Hour Announce Tour with Veil of Maya and Periphery &#124; Tour Dates |publisher=Metal Injection |date= September 9, 2010 }}</ref> [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]],<ref name="r1">{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=138182 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201083522/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=138182 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 1, 2013 |title=Periphery Added to the Dillinger Escape Plan'S Australian Tour |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=April 8, 2010 }}</ref> [[Fear Factory]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=14066 |title=Fear Factory, Winds of Plague, Periphery tour // News // Lambgoat |publisher=Lambgoat.com |date= February 23, 2010 }}</ref> [[Between the Buried and Me]], and [[Fair to Midland]].<ref name="m1">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/tour-dates/periphery-announce-dates-fair-midland-scale-summit |title=Periphery Announce Dates with Fair To Midland, Scale The Summit &#124; Tour Dates |publisher=Metal Injection |date= January 19, 2010}}</ref>

=== Spencer Sotelo, Matt Halpern and self-titled debut (2010&ndash;2011) ===
In 2009, Travis Orbin left the band to join [[Sky Eats Airplane]]. He was then replaced by Matt Halpern, who was scouted by Mansoor whilst playing for a local pop band. In January 2010, Sumerian and Periphery announced on April 20, as the release date of the band's self-titled debut album, to be distributed by [[Sumerian Records]] in the United States; [[Distort Entertainment]] in Canada; [[Roadrunner Records]] in Australia; [[Century Media Records]] in Germany, and the rest of the world. On January 20, 2010, amid speculation that they had changed vocalists again, Periphery uploaded an album sampler with vocals by Spencer Sotelo, a [[San Diego]] native who was later announced to be Periphery's new vocalist,<ref>{{cite web|author=Axl Rosenberg |url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/01/20/yep-periphery-have-another-new-singer/ |title=Yep, Periphery Have Another New Singer |publisher=MetalSucks |date= January 20, 2010 }}</ref> replacing Chris Barretto, who had been fired from the band due to personal differences (Mansoor referring to him as a "diva"), resulting in a minor feud that would not be resolved until late 2013 (see below).

Periphery released their self-titled debut album, ''[[Periphery (album)|Periphery]]'', through Sumerian Records on April 20, 2010. It debuted at No.&nbsp;128 on the Billboard Top 200, as well as No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=139273 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201225612/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=139273 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 1, 2013 |title=''Periphery'': First-Week Sales Revealed |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=April 28, 2010 }}</ref> To support the album: Periphery played multiple tours around the US and Canada; a short tour of Australia along with The Dillinger Escape Plan,<ref name="r1"/> and a headlining tour of the UK and mainland Europe in February 2011. The band's first headlining tour, "League Of Extraordinary Djentlemen Tour", had support from [[Tesseract (band)|TesseracT]] and Monuments in the UK, while their mainland European shows included Monuments and [[The Safety Fire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/page/News?news_id=103743 |title=Periphery Announce UK Tour |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.co.uk |date= November 9, 2010 }}</ref> The band ran into multiple health issues during the tour; Spencer Sotelo had a case of [[bronchitis]] and was regularly unable to perform the entire set. Jake Bowen fell and broke a finger in the first week of the UK tour and was unable to play for the rest of their headlining tour. He recovered and joined the band during the last couple of shows on their tour with [[Fair to Midland]] and [[Scale the Summit]] right before they dropped out of the tour.<ref name="m1"/>

On March 22, Periphery released a cover of [[Metallica]]'s song "[[One (Metallica song)|One]]", which was recorded for the [[Homefront (video game)|Homefront]] video game soundtrack and was released as a free download on the Homefront main website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/av/album-metal-covers-email-address-deal |title=An Album of Metal Covers for My E-mail Address? Deal! |publisher=Metal Injection |date= March 22, 2011 }}</ref>

=== ''Icarus EP'' and addition of Mark Holcomb (2011) ===
On January 19, 2011, the music video for "Jetpacks Was Yes!" was posted on [[NME]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/nme-video/periphery---jetpacks-was-yes-nme-exclusive/754765674001 |title=Periphery - 'Jetpacks Was Yes!' |publisher=Nme.Com |date= January 19, 2011}}</ref> The video features a re-recorded and re-structured version of the song which was released on ''Icarus EP''. Periphery's first single, from their ''Icarus EP'' titled "Frak the Gods", was released on March 24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarmessenger.com/news/periphery-streams-new-track-frak-the-gods/ |title=Periphery Streams New Track 'Frak The Gods' |publisher=Guitarmessenger.com |date= March 24, 2011 }}</ref>

On July 6, 2011, Periphery announced via a MySpace blog post that the band had parted ways with guitarist Alex Bois. However, they did not change touring schedules, hiring Mark Holcomb and Adam "Nolly" Getgood (of British [[progressive metal]] band Red Seas Fire) to play Alex's parts during live shows until they found a permanent replacement.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vince Neilstein |url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/07/06/periphery-lose-guitarist-alex-bois/ |title=Periphery Lose Guitarist Alex Bois |publisher=MetalSucks |date=July 6, 2011 }}</ref>

On September 7, 2011, they were announced as the opening act for [[Dream Theater]] on the European leg of [[A Dramatic Turn of Events Tour]] starting in January 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=162941 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908031902/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=162941 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 8, 2012 |title=Dream Theater To Tour Europe With Periphery |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=September 7, 2011 }}</ref> In October 2011, the band announced that Holcomb was now the band's full-time guitarist,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaxess.com/guitar-blog/guitar-news/periphery-officially-announce-mark-holcomb-as-new-guitarist |title=Periphery Officially Announce Mark Holcomb As New Guitarist |publisher=Allaxess.com |date=October 19, 2011 |access-date=October 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405191307/http://www.allaxess.com/guitar-blog/guitar-news/periphery-officially-announce-mark-holcomb-as-new-guitarist |archive-date=April 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and in November bassist Tom Murphy decided to leave the band. This led to Getgood being assigned the role of bassist for their European tour with Dream Theater.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/breakups/periphery-bassist-is-over-it |title=Periphery Bassist Is Over It |publisher=www.metalinjection.net |date= November 16, 2011 }}</ref> The band also hired Holcomb's brother Jeff as a stand-in bass player for their 2012 US tour with [[Protest The Hero]], Jeff Loomis, [[The Safety Fire]] and [[Today I Caught the Plague]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

On February 21, 2012 the band re-released their debut album with a new single on [[iTunes]] entitled "Passenger". This was a partially re-recorded version of an old Haunted Shores song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://killyourscene.info/periphery-interview/|title=- Periphery|publisher=Killyourscene.info|access-date=February 15, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215152315/http://killyourscene.info/periphery-interview/|archive-date=February 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== ''Periphery II: This Time It's Personal'' (2012–2013) ===
Periphery then entered the studio to work on their next two full-length releases to record reworked "Bulb" demos as well as completely new material written by the full band.<ref name="e1">{{cite web |author= Michael Hughes |title= Sonisphere UK 2011 Interview: Periphery – Jake Bowen |publisher= Espy Rock |date= July 28, 2011 |url= http://espyrock.com/interviews/sonisphere-uk-2011-interview-periphery-jake-bowen }}</ref> The album was to be produced by Mansoor and Getgood and engineered and mixed by [[Taylor Larson]] ([[Sky Eats Airplane]], Of Legends, Life on Repeat).

In July 2011, Mansoor elaborated on the forthcoming albums in Australian magazine ''Mixdown''. He confirmed that there would be two albums recorded, and that one would be a concept album. Mansoor has had an interest in a concept album for quite some time, stating that "[he] wanted to get this concept album out there. It's been an idea for years and years." Mansoor also revealed that the band would release the albums separately, saying "[they]'ll probably do a staggered release, three to six months apart" and that "[he] really want[s] them to be these separate bodies of work, because they will sound different, and be completely different approaches, too."<ref name=mix>{{cite news |author= Peter Hodgson |title= Periphery: A league of extraordinary djentlemen |newspaper= Mixdown |page= 30 |issue= 207 |date= July 2011 |url= http://www.mixdownmag.com.au/flipbook/index.php?issue=207&mag=Mixdown |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425121303/http://www.mixdownmag.com.au/flipbook/index.php?issue=207&mag=Mixdown |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-04-25 }}</ref>

''[[Periphery II: This Time It's Personal]]'' was made available for streaming on YouTube on June 28, 2012. Hours later, the band announced that Getgood had officially joined the band, his role in the band mostly being a bassist but also contributing to guitar parts in the studio (a role which he had already taken on during the recording of Periphery II), effectively making him the "multi-instrumentalist" of the band. Jeff Holcomb continued to perform with Periphery during the 2012 [[Summer Slaughter]] tour until they had to drop out due to a family emergency; this was done so that Getgood could perform his last show with Red Seas Fire at the inaugural UK Tech-Metal Fest.

Since the 2012 Summer Slaughter tour Jeff Holcomb has remained a regular part of the band's crew and still performs as a stand-in bass player when required. As well as this, he makes documentary films about the band's tours and directed the music video for Ragnarok.

=== ''Clear'' EP (2013–2014) ===

Spencer Sotelo hinted in 2 tweets in September 2013 that Periphery were planning to release a new EP, the writing for which was already well under way, to tide their fans over until the release of ''Juggernaut'', the band's much anticipated third full-length album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/upcoming-releases/periphery-frontman-hints-at-new-material-being-imminent|title=Periphery Frontman Hints at New Material Being Imminent|work=Metal Injection|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

In October, it was announced that Misha Mansoor, Mark Holcomb & Jake Bowen were having signature pickups released; the Bare Knuckle Pickups Juggernaut, the Seymour Duncan Alpha/Omega and DiMarzio Titan pickups, respectively. It was also announced that Bowen's Ibanez LACS "Titan" would be made as a signature guitar.

In November 2013, former singer Chris Barretto made a surprise appearance during an encore of "Icarus Lives!" at the Gramercy Theater. As well as ending the long-standing feud between Chris and Periphery, it also marked the end of Periphery's "This Tour is Personal" headlining tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSXZIPKPVrw|title=Chris Barretto with Periphery - Icarus Lives- November 2013|date=November 21, 2013|work=YouTube|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

In December, Periphery announced a new release entitled ''Clear'', set for release on January 28, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Av0kfz8R50|title=Periphery – Clear|date=December 3, 2013|work=YouTube|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Clear (EP)|Clear]]'' is a separate project from ''Juggernaut'' and was built around a unique concept: each track apart from the opener "Overture" was assigned to a different member of the band, who acted as the "creative director" for their respective song, and every track shares a theme from "Overture" to link each track in the release together. The band insisted that it should not be considered an EP as at 30 minutes in length it is longer than most EPs, but should not be classified as an album.
<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Periphery.alpha.jpg|thumb|left|Album art for the upcoming ''Juggernaut: Alpha'']] -->

=== ''Juggernaut'' (2014–2016) ===
"Juggernaut" is a concept which was under development by the band for several years. Misha had initially written a series of demos early in Periphery's history, which were sections of a planned extended composition with the "Juggernaut" title; this extended composition contained Periphery's breakthrough songs "Icarus Lives!" and "Jetpacks Was Yes!" as some of its sections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.co.uk/page/News?news_id=116667|title=Periphery Announce Tracklist For Upcoming Digital Special Edition of Their First Album To Be Released on 6 Feb 2012...|work=Roadrunner Records UK|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref> The idea of an extended piece was eventually scrapped and developed into a concept which would span an entire album.

During the ''[[Periphery II: This Time It's Personal|Periphery II]]'' album cycle it was planned that ''Juggernaut'' would be released 3–6 months after ''Periphery II'' as part of a double album. However, this plan was also dropped due to Periphery's touring commitments, pushing the release to 2015. The band delayed writing and pre-production even more to make time for writing and recording [[Clear (EP)|''Clear'']]. In early July 2014, Periphery began tracking and recording songs for Juggernaut.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

On the Escape From The Studio Tour, lead vocalist Spencer Sotelo stated that ''Juggernaut'' had been finished and would be released sometime in January 2015 through Sumerian Records. On November 5, 2014, Periphery announced a tour in support of the new record, which was released on January 27, 2015. They revealed that it will in fact be a double album, consisting of ''[[Juggernaut: Alpha]]'' and ''[[Juggernaut: Omega]]'', and that support acts for the album release tour in early 2015 will be [[Nothing More]], [[Wovenwar]], and [[Thank You Scientist]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Periphery Announce Two 'Juggernaut' Albums and North American Tour|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/periphery-announce-two-studio-albums-and-tour|website=Guitar World|access-date=November 30, 2014|date=November 5, 2014}}</ref>

===''Periphery III: Select Difficulty'' (2016–2018)===
In early 2016, various Periphery members announced through social media that they were working on what would become their fifth studio album.

Their songs are predominantly in Drop C in 6-string (CGCFAD), Drop G# in 7-string (G#D#G#C#F#A#D#), and standard in 8-string (F#BEADGBE). Their 8-string songs include "Ji", "Extraneous", "A Black Minute", "The Event", "22 Faces", "Four Lights", "Stranger Things" and "Hell Below" (for this song, they drop the low F# string down to C#).

For "Zyglrox", "Muramasa", "Alpha", "The Bad Thing", "Graveless", "Remain Indoors", "Habitual Line-Stepper", "Lune", "Prayer Position", "Chvrch Bvrner", "Garden in the Bones" and "Follow Your Ghost", they tune the low C (drop C) down to A (AGCFAD). "Ragnarok" is in a 7-string variation of the "Totla Mad" tuning, the low G# is tuned down to F# (F#D#G#C#F#A#D#). "Scarlet" is in Open Cadd9 tuning (CGCEGD). "Racecar" uses a tuning where instead of dropping the lowest string on the 7-string, they dropped the 6th string (A#C#G#C#F#A#D#). For the song "Reptile", they drop the 6th string from C (Drop C) to G (GGCFAD).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKQiK6_xf08|title=Misha Mansoor, Alex Bois & Jake Bowen Talk About The Tunings They Use|date=December 30, 2010|work=YouTube|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KicQ8R--G04|title=Mark Holcomb - Periphery / Haunted Shores: GuitarMessenger.com Masterclass 2 of 2|date=February 15, 2011|work=YouTube|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i8IUm08DAk|title=Periphery - Muramasa|date=July 9, 2012|work=YouTube|access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref>

== Other projects ==
Guitarists Mark Holcomb and Misha Mansoor have a side project called Haunted Shores. This project first became active in April 2010, before Holcomb was a member of Periphery, releasing two songs on a split EP with Cyclamen.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2010/04/06/review-cyclamenhaunted-shores-split-ep |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217030216/http://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2010/04/06/review-cyclamenhaunted-shores-split-ep/ |archive-date=February 17, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Through the remainder of 2010 and part of 2011, they periodically recorded and released new songs, sometimes featuring guest vocalists like Elliot Coleman or Mike Semesky. However, in late 2011 Holcomb officially joined Periphery, and the project unofficially went on hiatus. Their song "Passenger," which featured guest vocals by Spencer Sotelo, was released as a Periphery song in February 2012, and another song featuring Sotelo's vocals, "Scarlet" was re-recorded and released on Periphery's second album. No new music was released until 2015, when it was revealed that they were recording a 'debut' EP. ''Viscera'' was released on November 3, 2015, and featured a re-recorded version of one of their earlier songs ("Harrison Fjord") as well as several new songs.<ref>{{cite web|author=/ |url=https://hauntedshores.bandcamp.com |title=代做银行存单_代开收入证明 &#124; 专业办理中心 |website=Hauntedshores.bandcamp.com |access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>
