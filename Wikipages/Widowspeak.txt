'''Widowspeak''' is an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], United States. They are currently signed to [[Captured Tracks]].

==History==
The band formed in Brooklyn in 2010 by [[Tacoma, Washington]] natives Molly Hamilton and her friend Michael Stasiak, who have known each other since they were teenagers.<ref name="burcz"/> The pair met with guitarist Robert Earl Thomas and began practicing together. The band released their debut album ''[[Widowspeak (Widowspeak album)|Widowspeak]]'' in August 2011 to critical acclaim. The single "Harsh Realm" was featured in an episode of the television series ''[[American Horror Story]]''. In 2012, the band recruited bassist Pamela Garavano-Coolbaugh for their subsequent tours.<ref name="burcz"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/48571-widowspeak-announce-new-lp-share-track/ |title=Widowspeak Announce New LP, Share Track &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2015-09-06}}</ref>

After touring extensively for the first album, Stasiak and Garavano-Coolbaugh left the band. At the beginning of 2012, Widowspeak began to work on their second full-length album, ''Almanac''. ''Almanac'' was recorded by producer Kevin McMahon, who has also produced for Swans and Real Estate. The recording sessions took place in a century-old barn in the Hudson River Valley late in the summer of 2012. ''Almanac'' was released January 22, 2013.<ref name="new York Times">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/arts/music/new-albums-by-aaron-neville-and-widowspeak.html/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=New Album by Widowspeak|accessdate=2015-09-06}}</ref> In March 2013, Widowspeak was named one of [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse TV's]] 30 must-see artists at [[SXSW]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fuse.tv/galleries/2013/02/sxsw-2013-must-see-bands-south-by-southwest#7 |title=30 Must-See Acts at SXSW 2013 - Photos - South by Southwest - Festivals - Fuse |publisher=Fuse.tv |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2015-09-06}}</ref>
