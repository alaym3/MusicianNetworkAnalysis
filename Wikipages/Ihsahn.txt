'''Vegard Sverre Tveitan''' (born 10 October 1975), better known as '''Ihsahn''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|n}}), is a Norwegian multi-instrumentalist, vocalist and composer, best known for his work with [[black metal]] band [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]. Tveitan is also a founding member of [[Thou Shalt Suffer]], where he played guitar and keyboard in addition to vocal duties, and [[Peccatum]], a project in collaboration with his wife and fellow musician [[Starofash|Heidi Solberg Tveitan]], also known as [[Starofash]]. Since 2006, Tveitan has primarily devoted himself to solo albums and occasional guest appearances.

Beyond the characteristics typically associated with metal music, Tveitan's musical style also includes [[Classical music|classical]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], and [[Progressive music|progressive]] elements. He is a progenitor of the [[symphonic black metal]] genre. [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]'s final album, ''[[Prometheus: The Discipline of Fire & Demise]]'', composed by Ihsahn, epitomizes the genre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/symphonic-black-metal-ma0000012290|title=Symphonic Black Metal Music Genre Overview|website=AllMusic|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref><ref name="Sellheim 509–517">{{Cite journal|last=Sellheim|first=Nikolas|date=September 2016|title=Black and Viking metal: how two extreme music genres depict, construct and transfigure the (sub-)Arctic|journal=Polar Record|volume=52|issue=5|pages=509–517|doi=10.1017/S0032247416000280|s2cid=131719609|issn=0032-2474}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Tveitan was born in [[Notodden]], Norway, where he grew up on a large rural farm. He began playing piano at age six and guitar at age 10.<ref name="themetalchannel.net">{{Cite web|url=https://www.themetalchannel.net/interviews/ihsahn-talks-new-album-eremita-music-downloading-black-metal/|title=IHSAHN Talks New Album (Eremita), Music Downloading and Black Metal|date=15 June 2012|website=The Metal Channel|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref>

=== Early years: Xerasia, Embryonic, and Thou Shalt Suffer ===
At the age of 13, Tveitan met Tomas Haugen (also known as [[Samoth]]), who would become his long time collaborator and the co-founder of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor.]] While at a music seminar, Tveitan gained Haugen's attention with his [[Iron Maiden]] patches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.line6.com/artists/299 |title=Line 6 Artists |publisher=Line6.com |access-date=21 May 2015}}</ref>

In 1990 Tveitan joined Haugen's band [[Xerasia]], a [[death metal]] band in which he played guitar and keyboards. They eventually changed their name to Embryonic sometime that year. In November, the band released a self-financed four-track demo titled ''The Land of the Lost Souls''. In 1991 they changed their name again to [[Thou Shalt Suffer]]. The project was partially funded by a government grant and the group made several releases in 1990 and 1991.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=100 Greatest Metal Guitarists, The.|last=McIver, Joel.|date=2008|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|others=McIver, Joel.|isbn=9781906002831|location=Winona|oclc=1024277987}}</ref> Shortly after, Haugen left the band to focus on other projects. Tveitan later used the name Thou Shalt Suffer to release an album of electronic music that he composed entitled Somnium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Thou-Shalt-Suffer-Somnium/master/530168|title=Thou Shalt Suffer - Somnium|website=Discogs|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref>

=== Formation of Emperor and Peccatum ===
Later in 1991 Haugen and Tveitan formed [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]. Emperor had a much more refined [[black metal]] sound which showcased Tveitan's developing keyboard skills, a distinct feature that would appear in many of his later releases. The band at this time received a lot of support and encouragement from black metal pioneer [[Euronymous]], and after several demos, the ''Emperor'' EP was released in 1993 to much acclaim.

During this time, bandmates Bård Eithun (also known as [[Bård Faust|Faust]]) and Haugen were imprisoned; Eithun for murder and Haugen for arson.<ref name=":6" /> Tveitan retreated to a property owned by his family to compose much of what would later become ''[[Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk]],'' which was recorded after Haugen's parole.

In 1995 the cult album ''Blood Must be Shed'', by [[Zyklon-B (band)|Zyklon-B]] was released featuring members of Emperor and [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]]. Tveitan played synth on the album. In 1998 Tveitan and his wife [[Starofash|Heidi Solberg Tveitan]]—who at the time used the stage name Ihriel—formed the experimental band [[Peccatum]]. Tveitan offered his iconic synth sound as well as clean and black vocals to the project. Peccatum would eventually becoming his main project until its termination on 4 March 2006.

In 1999 Emperor released ''[[IX Equilibrium]]'', Tveitan's third studio album with the group. Two years later, in 2001, Peccatum released their second studio album, ''[[Amor Fati (Peccatum album)|Amor Fati]]''. In the same year, Emperor released their fourth and final studio album, ''[[Prometheus: The Discipline of Fire & Demise]]''. 'Prometheus' was entirely composed by Tveitan and featured more complex orchestration than previous works; though significantly less synthesizers than before. It was at this time that Emperor mutually decided to dissolve, leaving Tveitan and his bandmates with more time to focus on their various side projects.

2004 saw the release of Peccatum's third and final studio album, ''[[Lost in Reverie]]'', with an EP titled ''[[The Moribund People]]'' following the year after. On 30 September 2005, Emperor made a surprise return at ''Scream'' magazine's 15-year anniversary party at [[Rockefeller Music Hall]] in [[Oslo]]. The show was kept top secret, only known by a handful of people. The band played three songs. This was to announce the reuniting of the band for a few shows around Europe and America in 2006, namely at [[Wacken Open Air|Wacken]] and [[Inferno Festival]].

=== Solo albums ===

==== 2006–2010: ''The Adversary'', ''angL'', and ''After'' ====
[[File:Ihsahn live hole in the sky festival 27.8.2010 bergen norway.jpg|thumb|left|Ihsahn performing at [[Hole in the Sky]] 2010]]
In April 2006, Tveitan released his first solo album, ''[[The Adversary (Ihsahn album)|The Adversary]]''. He recorded and produced the album by himself, with the exception of drums which were contributed by [[Asgeir Mickelson]], and guest vocals on the track "Homecoming" by [[Kristoffer Rygg]] of [[Ulver]]. The album showcases his [[progressive metal|progressive]] influences as well as [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[black metal]] and [[European classical music|classical music]]. ''The Adversary'' was recorded at Symphonique Studios in Norway and was released on his label [[Mnemosyne Productions]], which he founded in 2003 with [[Starofash]]. A video was made for the opening track, "Invocation".

He released his second studio album, titled ''[[angL]]'', the following year, featuring Lars K. Norberg on bass, Asgeir Mickelson on drums, and guest vocals from [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] (of [[Opeth]]) on the track "Unhealer".

In March 2009, Tveitan performed some of his solo material live for the first time, in a one-off performance opening for Opeth in Norway. He has since made many festival appearances, playing a mix of solo material and Emperor covers. Fellow Norwegians [[Leprous (band)|Leprous]] have served as his backing band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=70951|title=Einar Solberg Of Leprous Talks New Album ''Bilateral'', Working With Ihsahn, And More|last=Arthur|first=Ty|website=metalunderground.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130619220023/http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=70951|archive-date=19 June 2013|access-date=16 June 2013|quote=Einar Solberg: StarOfAsh (Heidi) is my sister, so I would definitely say that we are rather close, hehe. The reason why Ihsahn choose us as his backing band was because we're already a rehearsed band which he knew he could trust. It was a win-win situation for both him and us. He can just meet up on rehearsals to an already rehearsed band that actually manage to play his music, while we get to play with one of the greatest artists in the metal genre.}}</ref> ''Grimen'', the only album by side project 'Hardingrock' was released the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mnemosyne-productions.tumblr.com/about|title=Releases|website=Mnemosyne Records|access-date=23 December 2018}}</ref>

Tveitan released his third solo album, ''[[After (Ihsahn album)|After]]'', in January 2010. Lars K. Nordberg and Asgeir Mickelson once again contributed bass and drums, respectively, with [[Jørgen Munkeby]] (of [[Shining (Norwegian band)|Shining]]) playing saxophone on several tracks as well. Later that year, in October, a Mnemosyne web update confirmed that Ihsahn had already begun writing for a fourth solo album, and was also focusing on upgrading his studio at home.<ref name=":1">[http://www.mnemosyne.no/productions/2010/10/mnemosyne-update/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918235911/http://www.mnemosyne.no/productions/2010/10/mnemosyne-update/|date=18 September 2011}}</ref>

==== 2011–2013: ''Bilateral'', ''Eremita'', and ''Das Seelenbrechen'' ====
2011 was a busy year for Tveitan. Aside from making his solo debut in the US at the annual [[ProgPower USA]] metal festival in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, he also performed as a guest on two records, co-produced the album ''[[Bilateral (album)|Bilateral]]'' with his wife, and continued to work on his fourth solo album. Collaborators once again included Jørgen Munkeby<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SHININGofficial/status/139430321547526144|title=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref> and [[Devin Townsend]], who in a November 2011 interview mentioned that he was "singing a song for Ihsahn's new thing", but added that he could not elaborate any more at that point in time.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=http://mindequalsblown.net/2011/11/interview-devin-townsend/|title=Interview: Devin Townsend|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Mind Equals Blown|access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, Tveitan released his fourth studio solo album, ''[[Eremita]]''.

''[[Das Seelenbrechen]]'' was released on 21 October 2013. It was recorded in Juke Joint Studio and Tveitan's own [[Mnemosyne Productions|Mnemosyne Studio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/das-seelenbrechen-mw0002563628|title=Das Seelenbrechen - Ihsahn {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref>

==== 2016–2018: ''Arktis'' and ''Àmr'' ====
In April 2016, Tveitan released his sixth studio album, ''[[Arktis]],'' on [[Candlelight Records]]. The album was mixed and mastered by [[Jens Bogren]].<ref name="Ihsahn - Arktis">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Ihsahn-Arktis/release/9159364|title=Ihsahn - Arktis.|website=Discogs|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> The album cover features a photograph of [[Fridtjof Nansen]], whose 1896 mission to the North Pole fits with the lyrical atmosphere of the album. They also share their birthday of 10 October.<ref name="Sellheim 509–517"/>

In 2018, Tveitan released ''[[Àmr]]'', his seventh studio album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Ihsahn-%C3%80mr/release/11968069|title=Ihsahn - Àmr|website=Discogs|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> The title of the album is an old Norse word for "loathsome" or "black" and reflects the introspective nature of the songs. Tveitan added that the word ''Àmr'', could also mean "rust red" and that the concept of a "room without walls" was a prevalent metaphor when working on the album.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Tveitan|first=Vegard Sverre|interviewer=Emre Karacaoglu|title=Ihsahn talks Amr, black metal, Kanye West and more (Istanbul 2018)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWiQAH56t0Q|work=Paslanmaz Kalem|publisher=Paslanmaz Kalem|location=Istanbul, Turkey|date=3 October 2018}}</ref> In comparison to previous albums, ''[[Àmr]]'' also features a greater use of electronic sounds, including [[analog synthesizer]]s, that add to the intimate feeling of the music.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Tveitan|first=Vegard Sverre|interviewer=KaaosTV|title=Ihsahn Interview @ Tuska Open Air 1.7.2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7NFR9xhL6s|work=KaaosTV|publisher=KaaosTV|location=Helsinki, Finland|date=7 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Awards and publications ===
In 2002, Tveitan was awarded the Notodden kommunes kulturpris (Notodden Municipality's Culture prize).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thorgersen & Thomas von Wachenfeld|first=Ketil & Thomas|date=2017|title=The Becomings of Satanist Musicianship|url=https://nmh.brage.unit.no/nmh-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2490536/The_becomings_of_satanist_musicianship_Thorgersen%26Wachenfeldt.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Nordic Research in Music Education|volume=18|issue=179–198|pages=183}}</ref> He won the prize because he is considered the best-known inhabitant of Notodden, a great musician, a music teacher, and he arranges a lot of concerts for unknown bands. The fact that his band sold more than 500,000 copies was also a reason for getting the prize.

Tveitan has instructional videos on playing guitar that have appeared in online publications such as ''[[Guitar World]]''.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/search|title=Search results for ihsahn {{!}} Search {{!}} Guitarworld|website=[[Guitar World]]|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref>

Tveitan's third solo album, ''[[After (Ihsahn album)|After]]'', was nominated for a Norwegian Grammy, a '[[Spellemannprisen]]'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antimusic.com/news/12/April/05Ihsahn_Sets_New_Album_Release.shtml|title=Ihsahn Sets New Album Release ::Ihsahn News ::antiMusic.com|website=antimusic.com|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref>

Tveitan lent his voice in 2007 to an animated character from the [[Adult Swim]] cartoon [[Metalocalypse]], Eric von Wiechlinghammer, in the episode "Dethfashion".

== Musical style and influences ==
In an interview in 2012, Tveitan cited [[Iron Maiden]], [[King Diamond]], [[Judas Priest]], and [[Pink Floyd]] as influential artists when he was young. He highlighted the conceptual and narrative aspects that these groups constructed their albums around as being particularly influential. His solo albums also strive to maintain a cohesive thread throughout.<ref name="themetalchannel.net"/> Tveitan has described planning the atmosphere and conceptual underpinnings of ''[[Arktis]]'' and ''[[Àmr]]'' before beginning the compositional process, and has rejected the idea that albums are mere collections of songs.<ref name=":0">{{cite interview|last=Tveitan|first=Vegard Sverre|interviewer=METALSHOP|title=IHSAHN (Emperor) - Interview Prague 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STyFyPz6tsg|work=METALSHOP|publisher=METALSHOP TV|location=Prague|date=10 November 2018}}</ref>

===Beliefs===
Ihsahn described himself a [[Satanism|Satanist]] in the 1990s. As he explained in 1994, he considered Satanism to be hard to define, as there are different ways of Satanism, and to be more of a category the individual would have to set for themselves. He considered most other adolescents to be "soulless" people, too involved in materialistic things. He said the imprisonment of the other Emperor members had both positive and negative effects; it meant a difficult period for the band, but the imprisonment also gave them publicity and therefore more possibilities to spread their ideas. Ihsahn additionally has said he has seen no reason to be physically destructive and has had no personal connection to the church burning cases that rocked Norway.<ref>''Det svarte alvor'', 1994.</ref> In a 1994 interview, Ihsahn described a [[social Darwinist]] influence on his Satanism, calling himself [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] and saying it is "not for a weak person", while also expressing respect towards European [[paganism]], meditation and stewardship of the environment. He has additionally condemned acts of criminality and other forms of [[religious intolerance]] such as the aforementioned arson cases.<ref name=on-satanism>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k5P_X5aHps |title=Ihsahn Interview about Satanism |publisher=YouTube|date=29 April 2007|access-date=11 June 2015}}</ref>
