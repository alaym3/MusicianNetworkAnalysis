Although their debut album, ''[[Bigbang Vol.1]]'' (2006), was released to lukewarm reception, greater success followed with a string of hit singles: "[[Lies (Big Bang song)|Lies]]" ([[Hangul|Korean]]: {{lang|ko|거짓말}}), which topped Korean music charts for a record-breaking six consecutive weeks and won [[Mnet Asian Music Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] at the [[2007 Mnet Km Music Festival]] and the 2008 [[Seoul Music Awards]]; "[[Last Farewell (Big Bang song)|Last Farewell]]" (Korean: {{lang|ko|마지막 인사}}); "[[Haru Haru]]" (Korean: {{lang|ko|하루하루}}); and "[[Sunset Glow#Big Bang version|Sunset Glow]]" (Korean: {{lang|ko|붉은노을}}). After winning [[Mnet Asian Music Award for Artist of the Year|Artist of the Year]] at the [[2008 Mnet Asian Music Awards|2008 Mnet Korean Music Festival]] and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards, the group released four Japanese studio albums—''[[Big Bang (2009 album)|Big Bang]]'' (2009), ''[[Big Bang 2 (album)|Big Bang 2]]'' (2011), ''[[Alive (Big Bang album)|Alive]]'' (2012), and ''[[Made Series]]'' (2016)—all of which were certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ). 

After a two-year hiatus in South Korea, the quintet returned with innovative and critically acclaimed records. Their fourth [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Tonight (Big Bang EP)|Tonight]]'' (2011), won them the inaugural [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Worldwide Act|Best Worldwide Act Award]] at the [[2011 MTV Europe Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/11/07/mtv-ema-awards-britney-spears-lady-gaga-justin-bieber-bruno-mars_n_1079256.html|title=MTV EMA Awards: Britney Spears Loses Out To Bigbang, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars, Eminem All Winners|last=Frost|first=Caroline|date=July 11, 2011|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=November 3, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302185942/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/11/07/mtv-ema-awards-britney-spears-lady-gaga-justin-bieber-bruno-mars_n_1079256.html|archive-date=March 2, 2013}}</ref> Their fifth EP, ''[[Alive (Big Bang EP)|Alive]]'' (2012), became the first Korean album to chart on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].
