==History==
===2005–2008: Career beginning and ''Vol. 1''===
The origins of the group go back to 2001 when Bogotá native Simón Mejía (previously a member of 1990s Colombian alternative rock band Charconautas) was part of a loose collective of musicians and visual artists under the name A.M. 770. Their music was influenced by Colombian groups such as [[Sidestepper]] and Bloque de Busqueda who in the late 1990s had started combining traditional Colombian musical rhythms such as [[salsa music|salsa]] and [[cumbia]] with modern electronic beats and dance music. A.M. 770's first musical production was the track "Ritmika" (based on a sample of a song by [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] salsa band Los Blanco) on the album ''Colombeat'', a 2002 compilation showcasing this new musical style which was put together by Colombia's foremost [[alternative rock]] band [[Aterciopelados]] for their new label Entrecasa.

By 2005 A.M. 770 had effectively become Mejía's solo project and he began to focus more on the musical side of his work, changing the name of the group to Bomba Estéreo. The first results of his new project was the seven-track mini-album ''Vol. 1'' (2006), essentially a solo album but featuring contributions from other artists such as fellow A.M. 770 member Diego Cadavid. Having recorded ''Vol. 1'', Mejía attended the [[Latin Alternative Music Conference]] in [[New York City]] and was able to secure an international distribution deal with [[California]]-based [[Nacional Records]] for future releases, with Colombian releases on the Bogotá independent label [[Polen Records]].

One of the vocalists Mejía had used on ''Vol. 1'' was [[Santa Marta]]-born<ref>{{cite news |title=Cuatro colombianos hablan de sus mejores vivencias navideñas |newspaper=El Tiempo |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-10905056 |date=December 7, 2011 |access-date=February 26, 2013|language=es}}</ref> singer and rapper Liliana "Li" Saumet, on the track "Huepaje". Saumet had briefly been the singer for the [[Dub music|dub reggae]] band Mister Gomes en Bombay before meeting Mejía at a concert.<ref name="MTVIggy20100827">{{cite web |title=Q&A with Li Saumet & Simón Mejia of Bomba Estéreo: 'We Fell in Love...

===2008–2011: ''Estalla''===
By the time the second album ''Estalla'' was released in 2008, Bomba Estéreo had developed into a full band, with Saumet on vocals, Cadavid on percussion, Julián Salazar on guitar, and former Sidestepper collaborator Enrique "Kike" Egurrola on drums, alongside Mejía on bass and keyboard programming. ''Estalla'' was released the following year in the [[United States|US]] under the new title ''Blow Up'', with the single "Fuego" helping to attract new fans outside Colombia and resulting in the group being voted "Best New Band in the World" for 2010 by viewers of [[MTV]] Iggy, the television channel's outlet for alternative world music artists.<ref>{{cite web |title=MTV Iggy Presents Bomba Estéreo |publisher=MTV Iggy |url=http://www.mtviggy.com/artists/bomba-estereo/ |access-date=February 26, 2013}}</ref><ref name="El Espectador20120904">{{cite news |title=La "Elegancia Tropical" de Bomba Estéreo |newspaper=[[El Espectador]] |location=Bogotá, Colombia |url=http://www.elespectador.com/entretenimiento/agenda/musica/articulo-372467-elegancia-tropical-de-bomba-estereo |date=September 4, 2012 |access-date=February 26, 2013|language=es}}</ref>

In 2010 the band were one of a dozen artists commissioned by [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] to cover songs from previous decades, as part of "Levi's Pioneer Sessions" marketing campaign. The group chose to record [[Technotronic]]'s "[[Pump Up the Jam]]", cited by Mejía as his favourite party record.<ref name="SoundsandColours2" /> The song was later released under the new title "Ponte Bomb" as the lead track on an EP of the same name, which also featured various remixes of the tracks "Fuego" and "La Boquilla" from ''Estalla''/''Blow Up''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bomba Estereo Covers "Pump Up the Jam" for Levi's Pioneer Sessions |publisher=MTV Iggy |url=http://www.mtviggy.com/blog-posts/bomba-estereo-covers-pump-up-the-jam-for-levis-pioneer-sessions/ |date=June 21, 2010 |access-date=March 3, 2013}}</ref>

The song "Fuego" can be heard in the background of the 2010 episode "Circle Us" on the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] television series ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', during a scene outside of a club, and later appeared on the series' soundtrack album.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130411090908/http://www.milanrecords.com/releases/releases.php?release_name=DEXTER_SEASON_5_MUSIC_FROM_THE_SHOWTIME_SERIES ''Dexter'' Series 5 soundtrack album, Milan Records website] Retrieved March 3, 2013.</ref> "Fuego" has also been used as the [[theme music|theme song]] of the [[Argentine people|Argentine]] television drama series ''El Puntero'' which aired in 2011, and features on the soundtrack of [[EA Sports]] [[video game]], ''[[FIFA 10]]''.<ref name="ElPais20110907">{{cite news |first=Ricardo |last= Castro |title=La cumbia se ha vuelto más 'cool' |newspaper=[[El Pais (Cali)|El Pais]] |location=[[Cali]], Colombia |url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2011/09/07/actualidad/1315346406_850215.html |date=September 7, 2011 |access-date=February 26, 2013|language=es}}</ref> The Dixone Remix of the song "La Boquilla" (from the band's 2011 EP ''Ponte Bomb'') was featured on the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Limitless (film)|Limitless]]'' that same year.
