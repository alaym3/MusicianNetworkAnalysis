Their debut album, ''[[Yo!

Public Enemy has gone through lineup changes over the years, with Chuck D and Flavor Flav the only constant members. Co-founder [[Professor Griff]] left in 1989 but rejoined in 1998, before parting ways again some years later. [[DJ Lord]] also joined Public Enemy in 1998 as the replacement of the group's original DJ [[Terminator X]].

Public Enemy's first four albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were all certified either [[RIAA certification|gold or platinum]] and were, according to music critic [[Robert Hilburn]] in 1998, "the most acclaimed body of work ever by a hip hop act".<ref name="Hilburn">{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Hilburn|date=July 5, 1998|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/05/entertainment/ca-788|title=Is Anyone Out There Really Listening?|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 11, 2013}}</ref> Critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called them "the most influential and radical band of their time".<ref name="allm">{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Public Enemy - Biography & History|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-enemy-mn0000856785/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref> They were inducted into [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/12/11/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-rush-public-enemy|title=Public Enemy, Rush, Heart, Donna Summer to be inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|work=EW.com|access-date=July 16, 2018|language=en}}</ref> They were honored with the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]].

==History==
===1985–1987: Formation and early years===
Public Enemy was formed in 1985 by Carlton Ridenhour ([[Chuck D]]) and William Drayton ([[Flavor Flav]]), who met at [[Long Island]]'s [[Adelphi University]] in the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} Developing his talents as an [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] with Flav while delivering furniture for his father's business, Chuck D and Spectrum City, as the group was called, released the record "Check Out the Radio", backed by "Lies", a social commentary—both of which would influence RUSH Productions' [[Run–D.M.C.]] and [[Beastie Boys]].<ref>Chang 2005, pp. 239, 241-242.</ref> Chuck D put out a tape to promote [[WBAU]] (the radio station where he was working at the time) and to fend off a local MC who wanted to [[freestyle battle|battle]] him. He called the tape ''Public Enemy #1'' because he felt like he was being persecuted by people in the local [[Subculture|scene]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} This was the first reference to the notion of a [[public enemy]] in any of Chuck D's songs. The single was created by Chuck D with a contribution by Flavor Flav, though this was before the group ''Public Enemy'' was officially assembled.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} Around 1986, Bill Stephney, the former Program Director at WBAU, was approached by Ali Hafezi and offered a position with the label.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} Stephney accepted, and his first assignment was to help fledgling producer [[Rick Rubin]] sign Chuck D, whose song "Public Enemy Number One" Rubin had heard from [[Doctor Dré|Andre "Doctor Dré" Brown]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

According to the book ''The History of Rap Music'' by [[Cookie Lommel]], "Stephney thought it was time to mesh the hard-hitting style of Run DMC with politics that addressed black youth. Chuck recruited Spectrum City, which included Hank Shocklee, his brother Keith Shocklee, and Eric "Vietnam" Sadler, collectively known as [[the Bomb Squad]], to be his production team and added another Spectrum City partner, [[Professor Griff]], to become the group's Minister of Information. With the addition of Flavor Flav and another local mobile DJ named [[Terminator X (DJ)|Terminator X]], the group Public Enemy was born".{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} According to Chuck, The S1W, which stands for Security of the First World, "represents that the black man can be just as intelligent as he is strong. It stands for the fact that we're not third-world people, we're first-world people; we're the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|original]] people".<ref>Chuck D. and Yusuf Jah, ''[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]'', p. 82.</ref> Hank Shocklee came up with the name Public Enemy based on "underdog love and their developing politics" and the idea from Def Jam staffer Bill Stephney following the [[Howard Beach racial incident]], [[Bernhard Goetz]], and the [[death of Michael Stewart]]: "The Black man is definitely the public enemy."<ref>Chang 2005, p. 247.</ref>

Public Enemy started out as opening act for the Beastie Boys during the latter's ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' popularity,{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} and in 1987 released their debut album ''[[Yo! Bum Rush The Show|Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The group's debut album, ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'', was released in 1987 to critical acclaim.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} In October 1987, music critic [[Simon Reynolds]] dubbed Public Enemy "a superlative ''rock'' band".<ref>Reynolds, Simon. "Public Enemy", ''Melody Maker'', October 17, 1987.</ref> They released their second album, ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'', in 1988, which performed better in the charts than their previous release, and included the hit single "[[Don't Believe the Hype]]" in addition to "[[Bring The Noise|Bring the Noise]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} It was the first hip hop album to be voted album of the year in ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s influential [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=Joseph|date=December 11, 2012|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/12/decking-the-hall-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fames-new-members/slide/public-enemy/|title=Decking the Hall: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's New Members – Public Enemy|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=New York|access-date=June 11, 2013}}</ref>

In 1989, the group returned to the studio to record their third album, ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]'', which continued their politically charged themes. The album was supposed to be released in late 1989,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK1uLUXpAzoC&pg=PA100 |title=SPIN - Google Books |date= September 1989|access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> but was pushed back to April 1990.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} It was the most successful of any of their albums and, in 2005, was selected for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} It included the singles "[[Welcome to the Terrordome]]", written after the band was criticized by Jews for Professor Griff's anti-semitic comments, "[[911 Is a Joke]]", which criticized emergency response units for taking longer to arrive at emergencies in the black community than those in the white community, and "[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/vh1-crowns-public-enemys-fight-the-power-as-best-hip-hop-song/353728/ |title=Canadian Music - HuffPost Canada |website=music.aol.ca |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> "Fight the Power" is regarded as one of the most popular and influential songs in hip hop history.<ref>[[Spike Lee|Lee, Spike]].

[[File:Chuck D. Slakthuset i Malmö 1991.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Chuck D. performing in [[Malmö]] in 1991]]The group's fourth album, ''[[Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black]]'', continued this trend, with songs like "Can't Truss It", which addressed the history of slavery and how the black community can fight back against oppression; "I Don't Wanna be Called Yo Nigga", a track that takes issue with the use of the word ''nigga'' outside of its original derogatory context.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} The album also included the controversial song and video "[[By the Time I Get to Arizona]]", which chronicled the black community's frustration that some US states did not recognize [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s birthday as a national holiday. The video featured members of Public Enemy taking out their frustrations on politicians in the states not recognizing the holiday.<ref>{{cite web| title = Public Enemy Look Back at 20 Years of 'By the Time I Get to Arizona'| work = Spin Magazine| publisher = SpinMedia| url =http://www.spin.com/2011/11/public-enemy-look-back-20-years-time-i-get-arizona/| date = November 10, 2011}}</ref>

He has a year to get his act together and get himself straight or he's out".<ref name="YahooCeaseDesist"/> A lawyer for Chuck D added: "Chuck could perform as Public Enemy if he ever wanted to; he is the sole owner of the Public Enemy trademark.

On March 1, 2020, prior to the group's performance at the Sanders rally, Chuck D, DJ Lord, Jahi, James Bomb and Pop Diesel issued a joint statement announcing that Flavor Flav had been fired from the group, stating: "Public Enemy and Public Enemy Radio will be moving forward without Flavor Flav.

Public Enemy made contributions to the hip-hop world with sonic experimentation as well as political and cultural consciousness, which infused itself into skilled and poetic [[rhymes]]. Critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote that "PE brought in elements of [[free jazz]], hard [[funk]], even [[musique concrète]], via [its] producing team the Bomb Squad, creating a dense, ferocious sound unlike anything that came before."<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-back-mw0000196315 |title=It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back - Public Enemy &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 19, 2014|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/fight-the-presets/Jun-06/20956 |title=Electric & Acoustic Guitar Gear, Lessons, News, Blogs, Video, Tabs & Chords |website=GuitarPlayer.com |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> 
Public Enemy held a strong, pro-black, political stance. Before PE, politically motivated hip-hop was defined by a few tracks by [[Ice-T]], [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]], [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Boogie Down Productions]]. Other politically motivated opinions were shared by prototypical artists [[Gil Scott-Heron]] and [[the Last Poets]]. PE was a revolutionary hip-hop act whose entire image rested on a specified political stance. With the successes of Public Enemy, many hip-hop artists began to celebrate [[Afrocentricity|Afrocentric]] themes, such as [[Kool Moe Dee]], [[Gang Starr]], [[X Clan]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[the Jungle Brothers]], and [[A Tribe Called Quest]].

[[File:PE at Vegoose 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Public Enemy at Vegoose in 2007. From left: [[DJ Lord]], [[Chuck D]], and [[Flavor Flav]].]]Public Enemy was one of the first hip-hop groups to do well internationally. PE changed the Internet's music distribution capability by being one of the first groups to release [[MP3]]-only albums,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/archive/topics/infoart/public-enemy/index.html|title=Transcriptions Topics: Artists of Information: Public Enemy and MP3|date=May 9, 2003|access-date=October 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030509235039/http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/archive/topics/infoart/public-enemy/index.html|archive-date=May 9, 2003}}</ref> a format virtually unknown at the time.

Public Enemy helped to create and define "[[rap metal]]" by collaborating with [[Living Colour]] in 1988 ("[[Funny Vibe]]"), with [[Sonic Youth]] on the 1990 song "[[Kool Thing]]", and with New York [[thrash metal]] outfit [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] in 1991. The single "[[Bring the Noise]]" was a mix of semi-militant [[black power]] lyrics, grinding guitars, and sporadic humor. The two bands, cemented by a mutual respect and the personal friendship between Chuck D and Anthrax's [[Scott Ian]], introduced a hitherto alien genre to rock fans, and the two seemingly disparate groups toured together. Flavor Flav's pronouncement on stage that "They said this tour would never happen" (as heard on Anthrax's ''[[Live: The Island Years]]'' CD) has become a legendary comment in both rock and hip-hop circles. Metal guitarist [[Vernon Reid]] (of [[Living Colour]]) contributed to Public Enemy's recordings, and PE sampled [[Slayer]]'s "Angel of Death" half-time riff on "She Watch Channel Zero?!"

Members of the Bomb Squad produced or remixed works for other acts, like [[Bell Biv DeVoe]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Blue Magic (band)|Blue Magic]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[L.L. Cool J]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Jasmine Guy]], [[Jody Watley]], [[Eric B & Rakim]], [[Third Bass]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[EPMD]], and [[Chaka Khan]]. According to Chuck D, "We had tight dealings with [[MCA Records]] and were talking about taking three guys that were left over from [[New Edition]] and coming up with an album for them. The three happened to be Ricky Bell, [[Michael Bivins]], and [[Ronnie DeVoe]], later to become [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. [[Ralph Tresvant]] had been slated to do a solo album for years, [[Bobby Brown]] had left New Edition and experienced some solo success beginning in 1988, and [[Johnny Gill]] had just been recruited to come in, but [he] had come off a solo career and could always go back to that. At MCA, Hiram Hicks, who was their manager, and Louil Silas, who was running the show, were like, 'Yo, these kids were left out in the cold. Can y'all come up with something for them?' It was a task that Hank, Keith, Eric, and I took on to try to put some kind of hip-hop-flavored R&B shit down for them. Subsequently, what happened in the four weeks of December [1989] was that the Bomb Squad knocked out a large piece of the production and arrangement on [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]'s three-million selling album ''Poison''. In January [1990], they knocked out ''Fear of a Black Planet'' in four weeks, and PE knocked out [[Ice Cube]]'s album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' in four to five weeks in February."<ref>''Fight The Power'', pp. 236–237</ref> They have also produced local talent such as [[Son of Bazerk]], [[Young Black Teenagers]], Kings of Pressure, and True Mathematics—and gave producer [[Kip Collins]] his start in the business.

Poet and [[hip-hop]] artist [[Saul Williams]] uses a sample from Public Enemy's "Welcome to the Terrordome" in his song "Tr[n]igger" on the ''Niggy Tardust'' album.  He also used a line from the song in his poem, ''amethyst rocks''.

The [[Manic Street Preachers]] track "Repeat (Stars And Stripes)" is a remix of the band's own anti-monarchy tirade by Public Enemy production team [[The Bomb Squad]] of whom [[James Dean Bradfield]] and [[Richey Edwards]] were big fans. The song samples "Countdown to Armageddon" from ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]''. The band had previously sampled Public Enemy on their 1991 single [[Motown Junk]].

The revolutionary influence of the band is seen throughout hip-hop and is recognized in society and politics. The band "rewrote the rules of hip-hop", changing the image, sound and message forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/public-enemy-mn0000856785/biography|title=Public Enemy - Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8463262/public-enemy-it-takes-a-nation-of-millions-to-hold-us-back|title=Public Enemy Talks 'It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back' on Its 30th Anniversary|website=Billboard|access-date=December 12, 2018|date=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Pro-black lyrics brought political and social themes to hardcore hip hop, with stirring ideas of racial equality, and retribution against police brutality, aimed at disenfranchised blacks, but appealing to all the poor and underrepresented.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/ballad-boombox-what-public-enemy-tells-us-about-hip-hop-race-and-society-180962095/|title=The Ballad of the Boombox: What Public Enemy Tells Us About Hip-Hop, Race and Society|first=Lorraine|last=Boissoneault|website=Smithsonian|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dallasweekly.com/arts_and_entertainment/article_2f281b60-4b8f-11e2-8185-0019bb30f31a.html|title=The Undying Influence of Public Enemy|author=Jihad Hassan Muhammad|newspaper=[[The Dallas Weekly]]|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref> Before Public Enemy, hip hop music was seen as "throwaway entertainment", with trite sexist and homophobic lyrics.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8945572/Public-Enemy-Prophets-of-Rage-how-the-hip-hop-group-rescued-rap.html|title=Public Enemy: Prophets of Rage - how the hip hop group rescued rap|first=Andrew|last=Pettie|date=December 9, 2011|access-date=December 12, 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> Public Enemy brought social relevance and strength to hip hop.

==Controversy==
===Martin Luther King Day===
The 1991 song "[[By the Time I Get to Arizona]]" from ''[[Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black]]'' referenced the controversy a year earlier when Arizona cancelled a [[Martin Luther King Day|state holiday]] for [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and the NFL switched [[Super Bowl XXVII#Arizona's Martin Luther King Day controversy|Super Bowl XXVII from Arizona to California]], costing the state an estimated loss of over $100&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-11-08/sports/9004040444_1_super-bowl-xxvii-phoenix-mayor-paul-johnson-dick-berthelsen|title=Vote Costs Phoenix Super Bowl|work=chicagotribune.com|date=November 8, 1990|author= Don Pierson}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/arizona-super-bowl_n_4848871|work=huffingtonpost|title= This Wouldn't Be The First Time Bigots In Arizona Lost The State A Super Bowl|author=Amanda Terkel|date=February 24, 2014}}</ref> A video of "By the Time I Get to Arizona", which was shown only once on MTV, depicted Chuck D killing Arizona officials with machine guns and a car bomb.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2011/11/public-enemy-look-back-20-years-time-i-get-arizona/|work=Spin|title=Public Enemy Look Back at 20 Years of 'By the Time I Get to Arizona'|author=Evan Serpick |date= November 10, 2011}}</ref>

===Anti-Semitism===
In 1989, in an interview with Public Enemy for the ''[[Washington Times]]'', the interviewing journalist, [[David Mills (writer)|David Mills]], lifted some quotations from a UK magazine in which the band were asked their opinion on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. Professor Griff commented that "Jews are responsible for the majority of the wickedness in the world" (p.&nbsp;177), a quote from ''[[The International Jew]]''.  Shortly after, Chuck D expressed an apology on his behalf.<ref name="Pareles1989">{{cite news|author=Pareles, Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/11/arts/public-enemy-rap-group-reorganizes-after-anti-semitic-comments.html|title=Public Enemy Rap Group Reorganizes After Anti-Semitic Comments|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 11, 1989|access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> At a June 21, 1989, press conference, Chuck D announced Griff's dismissal from the group,<ref name="Pareles1989"/> and a June 28 statement by [[Russell Simmons]], president of [[Def Jam Recordings]] and Rush Artists Management, stated that Chuck D. had disbanded Public Enemy "for an indefinite period of time".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pareles|first1=John|title=Rap Group Disbands Under Fire|work=The New York Times|date=June 29, 1989|page=C19}}</ref> By August 10, however, Chuck D denied that he had disbanded the group, and stated that Griff had been re-hired as "Supreme Allied Chief of Community Relations" (in contrast to his previous position with the group as Minister of Information).<ref name="Pareles1989"/> Griff later denied holding anti-Semitic views and apologized for the remarks.<ref name="Hilburn3">{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=April 10, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-10/entertainment/ca-938_1_public-enemy|title=POP MUSIC REVIEW: Public Enemy Keeps Up Attack|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles|access-date=October 17, 2011}}</ref> Several people who had worked with Public Enemy expressed concern about Chuck D's leadership abilities and role as a social spokesman.<ref name="Hilburn2">{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Hilburn|date=February 4, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-04/entertainment/ca-470_1_public-enemy|title=Rap—The Power and the Controversy: Success has validated pop's most volatile form, but its future impact could be shaped by the continuing Public Enemy uproar|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles Times|access-date=October 17, 2011}}</ref>

In his 2009 book, entitled ''Analytixz'',<ref>Professor Griff. Analytixz: 20 Years of Conversations and Enter-views with Public Enemy's Minister of Information. Atlanta: RATHSI Publishing, 2009, p. 12.</ref> Griff criticized his 1989 statement: "to say the Jews are responsible for the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe I would have to know about the majority of wickedness that went on around the globe, which is impossible ... I'm not the best knower. Then, not only knowing that, I would have to know who is at the crux of all of the problems in the world and then blame Jewish people, which is not correct." Griff also said that not only were his words taken out of context, but that the recording has never been released to the public for an unbiased listen.

The controversy and apologies on behalf of Griff spurred Chuck D to reference the negative press they were receiving. In 1990, Public Enemy issued the single "Welcome to the Terrordome", which contains the lyrics: "Crucifixion ain't no fiction / So-called chosen frozen / Apologies made to whoever pleases / Still they got me like Jesus". These lyrics have been cited by some in the media as anti-Semitic, making supposed references to [[Chosen people|the concept of the "chosen people"]] with the lyric "so-called chosen" and [[Jewish deicide]] with the last line.<ref>Christgau, Robert. [http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/pe-90.php Jesus, Jews, and the Jackass Theory: Public Enemy]</ref>

In 1999 the group released an album entitled ''[[There's a Poison Goin' On]]''. The title of the last song on the album is called "Swindler's Lust".  The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) claimed that the title of the song was a word play on the title of the Steven Spielberg movie ''[[Schindler's List]]'' about the genocide of Jews in World War II.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/1999/07/13/profits-of-rage/|title=Profits of Rage|website=Villagevoice.com|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref> Similarly in 2000 a Public Enemy spin off group under the name [[Confrontation Camp]], a name according to the ADL, that is a pun on the term [[concentration camp]], released an album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/515476/jewish-group-decries-public-enemys-swindlers-lust/|title=Jewish Group Decries Public Enemy's 'Swindler's Lust'|last=Archive-Chris-Nelson|website=MTV News|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref> The group consisted of Kyle Jason, Chuck D (under the name Mistachuck) and Professor Griff.

===Homophobia===
''Fear of a Black Planet'''s "Meet the G That Killed Me" described propagation of [[HIV]].  Upon its 1990 release, ''[[New York Times]]'' writer Peter Watrous criticized the song's lyrics as containing "stupidly crude" [[homophobia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/22/arts/recordings-public-enemy-makes-waves-and-compelling-music.html |title=Public Enemy Makes Waves - and Compelling Music|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 22, 1990|access-date=September 9, 2020}}</ref>  [[Zoe Williams]] defended Public Enemy against charges of homophobia, citing the same passage as Watrous:

{{Quote|text=If you look at the seminal black artists at the start of hip-hop, Public Enemy and [[N.W.A|Niggaz Wit Attitudes]], you won't actually find much homophobia. The only recorded homophobic lyric in Public Enemy's canon was: 'Man to man/ I don't know if they can/ From what I know/ The parts don't fit' (a lyric from "Meet the G that Killed Me" on ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]''").|sign=Williams, Zoe|source=[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,945463,00.html "Hiphopophobia"], ''The Guardian'', 29 April 2003}}
