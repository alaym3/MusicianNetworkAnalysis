In 1988, he sang "Celebration of a Nation", with Keren Minshull (later a member of band [[Euphoria (Australian band)|Euphoria]]), the theme song for the [[Australian Bicentenary]].<ref name="McFarlane"/> Price later opined "That song made me realise I wanted a recording career of my own. I knew I needed a deal but it was also clear to me that before I did that, I had to write songs I was happy with."<ref name="Leedham">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126961373 |title=The new Price is right | last = Leedham | first = Nicole |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=67 |issue=21,060 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=10 December 1992 |access-date=18 September 2016 |page=21 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> He also provided vocals on "You're not Alone" (April 1988) by the Australian Olympians – an ensemble of various local artists – as a theme song for the national [[1988 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] campaign.

===1991-1992: ''Heaven Knows''===
{{Main|Heaven Knows (Rick Price album)}}
In 1991, Price signed a deal with [[Sony Music Australia|Columbia Records]] and he travelled to [[Los Angeles]] to work with producer, [[Chris Lord-Alge]] ([[Elton John]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Roxette]]).<ref name="McFarlane"/> He issued his debut solo single, "[[Not a Day Goes By (Rick Price song)|Not a Day Goes By]]", in February 1992. It was co-written by Price with Pamela Reswick and Steve Werfel.<ref name="ASCAP Not">{{cite web | url = https://mobile.ascap.com/aceclient/AceWeb/#ace/search/title/Not%20a%20Day%20Goes%20By/performer/rick%20price | title = ACE Repertory – Title: 'Not a Day Goes Past' Performer: Rick Price | publisher = [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) | access-date = 18 September 2016 }}</ref> The track was placed on high rotation on radio with the associated music video presented on national TV.

In June 1992, his second single, "[[Heaven Knows (Rick Price song)|Heaven Knows]]", was released.<ref name="AusCharts"/> Price co-wrote that track with Heather Field.<ref name="ASCAP Heaven">{{cite web | url = https://mobile.ascap.com/aceclient/AceWeb/#ace/search/title/Heaven%20Knows/performer/rick%20price | title = ACE Repertory – Title: 'Heaven Knows' Performer: Rick Price | publisher = American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) | access-date = 18 September 2016 }}</ref> It reached No.&nbsp;6.<ref name="AusCharts"/> The song helped launch his international career. In May of that year, he joined the ''Wizard of Oz'' showcase in Los Angeles, where he performed alongside Tina Arena and other Australian artists. In July, Price released his debut album, ''Heaven Knows'', entered the ARIA Albums Chart at No.&nbsp;3 and stayed in the Top&nbsp;40 chart for nine&nbsp;weeks – it returned to the Top&nbsp;40 in May of the following year.<ref name="AusCharts"/>

Australian musicologist [[Ian McFarlane]] described the album as "a well-crafted blend of radio-friendly Adult Oriented Rock (AOR), pop and soul material" where Price had used "hot US session players who had collectively worked with everyone from [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] to [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Barbra Streisand]]."<ref name="McFarlane"/> It had also been produced by Lord-Alge.<ref name="Holmgren"/> Price explained to Nicole Leedham of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'', "I could have made the album earlier but I didn't want to go ahead and sign the wrong deal, that can really destroy an artist's career. I also wanted to make sure that I was absolutely happy with every single track on the record."<ref name="Leedham"/> To promote the album, he formed the Rick Price Band with P. J. Becker on backing vocals, Mike Caen on guitar, Mitch Farmer<!-- Not the footballer --> on drums, Shauna Jensen on backing vocals, Peter Northcote on guitar and Victor Rounds on bass guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

In August, ''Heaven Knows'' was released in Europe and Asia, it reached the top&nbsp;100 on the [[GfK Entertainment Charts|German Albums Chart]] in the following February.<ref name="GerCharts Heaven">{{cite web | url = https://www.offiziellecharts.de/album-details-31449 | title =  Rick Price &#91;AU&#93; ''Heaven Knows'' | publisher = [[GfK Entertainment Charts|Offizielle Deutsche Charts]] | language = de | access-date = 18 September 2016 }}</ref> In September Price embarked on his first solo tour of Australia.<ref name="Leedham"/> He followed with a promotional trip to Europe including the United Kingdom. In October, he returned to Europe for further TV appearances and then a three-week promotional trip to [[Southeast Asia]]. By the end of the year, his group's line-up was P.J. Becker, Chris Becker on bass guitar, Phil Gildea on guitar, Robert Parde on keyboards and David Porter on drums.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/>

In November 1992, Price returned to Australia where he, and his co-writer Field, won the Song of the Year category for "Heaven Knows" at the [[APRA Awards (Australia)#Song of the Year|APRA Music Awards]].<ref name="APRA 92">{{cite web | url = http://apraamcos.com.au/awards/1990-1999/1992-music-awards/ | title = 1992 APRA Music Award Winners | publisher = [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) &#124; [[Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society]] (AMCOS) | year = 1992 | access-date = 18 September 2016 }}</ref> In December 1992 Price was invited to Germany to perform on a variety show. He then made a 36-hour stopover in [[Metro Manila|Manila]] where he made six TV appearances, two radio interviews and a handful of press.

"Heaven Knows" held the top spot in Malaysia for four consecutive weeks while "Not a Day Goes By" sat just behind it in the Top 5. In the Philippines, "Heaven Knows" sat at number 1 for all of November and December. During this time, the album sold over 250,000 units alone in Southeast Asia. Price went on to say, "It was an exhausting experience, but it was stimulating at the same time. It was all new to me, going to places I'd never been and doing stuff I'd never done, so I certainly didn't get tired of it."

===1993-1994: Touring and recognition===
In January and February 1993, Price once again toured Australia to sold-out venues. In April, he was nominated for 3 [[ARIA Awards]] and on the night performed a tribute to [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]] with "[[Tenterfield Saddler]]". Later in May, he was asked to perform the song on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' who were in Australia for 2 weeks. The performance was aired to 5 million people. Later that month, ''Heaven Knows'' was re-released and included the bonus CD ''Rarities''. Rick spent 2 weeks travelling the country and promoting the re-release performing in acoustic mode.

In July 1993, ''Heaven Knows'' was released in America and Canada. Back home, Price continued his touring, this time in the Northern Territory and northern Queensland area, which he had not previously performed in. The tour was extremely successful, with all shows being theatres and all sold out.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

In October 1993, Rick performed more concerts in Southeast Asia, which incorporated 7 shows in 9 days. They were all sell-outs. The [[Sentosa]] Music Festival in [[Singapore]] saw Rick perform in front of 15,000 people. Before returning to Australia, Rick visited Korea for short promotional and concert tour.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Price once again joined the ''Wizard of Oz'' showcases in Japan, where the album was launched. Whilst in Japan, Rick won Song of the Year for "[[Walk Away Renee]]" and Album of the Year for ''Heaven Knows'' at the Australian Music Awards. On his return from Japan, Rick was awarded the 1993 Australian Export Award for recognition of his international success. During the month, a new single "[[Where Is the Love (Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway song)#Rick Price and Margaret Urlich version|Where Is the Love]]", a duet with New Zealand musician [[Margaret Urlich]], was released.

In December 1993, Price was invited to the Singapore Music Awards as a special guest. He picked up Song of the Year for "Heaven Knows", then came back home to Australia for more touring before being invited to perform on the numerous [[Carols by Candlelight]] shows around the country and performing "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]". The year was topped off when Price was presented with an Advance Australia Foundation award (in recognition of making an outstanding contribution to the growth and enhancement of Australia and its people).{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

During 1994, Price spent the majority of time writing material for his anticipated follow-up album. From September to December, Price recorded his second album in Melbourne with a host of Australia's leading musicians.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

===1995-1996: ''Tamborine Mountain''===
{{Main|Tamborine Mountain (album)}}
In April 1995, the single "[[River of Love (Rick Price song)|River of Love]]" was released, the first from Price's album ''Tamborine Mountain'', which was later released in July. Price said "It was quite difficult, because I knew it was going to be a different album to ''Heaven Knows''. I made that album as pop as I could make it, I wanted to be certain of airplay and all those kind of things. After the first album was released, I went out and played a lot of acoustic gigs. My audience tripled and people really liked it, which surprised me because I thought it would be a bit too internal, a bit too self-conscious. But it worked, which gave me a lot of encouragement and the confidence to write more like that, just simple little stories. And that's the kind of music I've always been drawn to - people like [[James Taylor]] and [[Carole King]], great songwriters who have the ability to say something really simple".{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

The album was produced by Price and American Ben Wisch, who Price was drawn to as a result of his production of [[Marc Cohn]]'s "[[Walking in Memphis]]". Special guests on the album include Tommy Emmanuel on guitar and Tina Arena on backing vocals, and the duet "Trust Me This Is Love".{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

After the success of the first single, "River of Love", a second single "Bridge Building Man" was released. The song was written for his father and grandfather. The album title itself refers to a small town near [[Beaudesert, Queensland|Beaudesert]] where Price grew up.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

In November and December 1995, following the album release, Price then toured with Australia's legendary guitarist Tommy Emmanuel. The tour, Rick Price & Tommy Emmanuel - Together & Alone, was a sell-out. It received rave reviews from critics and the public alike.

In conjunction with the tour, a third single, "To Be with You" was released in Australia. Price performed at several Carols by Candlelight shows around the country and continued to tour during early 1996. "You're Never Alone", a song Price wrote for his son, was released in Australia while he travelled the country on further promotional tours throughout the year.

===1997-2003: ''Another Place'' and ''A Million Miles''===
{{Main|Another Place (Rick Price album)}}
In January and February 1997, Price played several shows alongside another accomplished Australian singer/songwriter, Jack Jones. The shows were a huge success with the pair performing their best hits together and alone, proving yet again their abilities as live performers.

For the majority of the year, Price spent his time in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] writing material for his next album.

Some of the collaborators Price has worked with included Steve Werfel and Pam Reswick on "Not a Day Goes By" (who has written songs such as "[[Chains (Tina Arena song)|Chains]]" by Tina Arena), [[Jon Lind]] (who has written songs such as "[[Simple Life (John Farnham song)|Simple Life]]" by [[John Farnham]], and "[[Crazy for You (Madonna song)|Crazy for You]]" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]), and [[Randy Goodrum]], a well-respected writer from Nashville. He has also written with Australia's Heather Field, who co-wrote "Heaven Knows" and "River of Love", and once again has worked with Phil Buckle, who co-wrote "What's Wrong With That Girl" from Rick's ''Heaven Knows'' album.

In November and December 1997, Price played a couple of showcases to the public with some of the new material he had been working on. During the later months of 1997 and early 1998, Price recorded his new album in Los Angeles. The album ''Another Place'' was released in Australia in July 1999, spanning singles including "Where in the World" and "Good As Gone". In 2003, parting with Sony, Price released another solo album, ''A Million Miles'', on his own label Clarice. Described as a garage album and going back to his musical roots, he plays every instrument heard on the album.

===2004-2010: ''2UP'', ''Revisited'' and John Denver tour===
Starting from around 2004 Price spent much of his time writing with and recording and producing for other artists such as [[Melinda Schneider]], Tamara Stewart, [[Lisa Chappell]] and [[David Franj]]. In 2004, ''The Best of Rick Price'' CD and DVD was released, containing all of Price's bigger hits.

In 2007 Price recorded an album with [[Mitch Grainger]] called ''2UP'', featuring acoustic-style covers of such artists as [[Chris Isaac]], and was featured in the soundtrack to the film ''[[December Boys]]''.  
 
In 2008, ''Revisited'', an album of his greatest hits recorded in an "intimate acoustic style", was released. He toured Tasmania with the band Invisible Boy at the year's conclusion.

In 2009, after having relocated to Nashville, Price toured the US with Australian guitar virtuoso [[Tommy Emmanuel]] before returning to Australia and touring in a legacy show to singer-songwriter [[John Denver]], with "The John Denver Story".
