==Career==

=== 1976–1978 ===

Although the U.K. Subs were part of the original [[punk rock|punk]] movement in England, the band originally started playing as part of the pub rock scene under the name The Marauders. In 1976, after seeing a couple of punk rock shows at [[The Roxy (Covent Garden)|The Roxy]], the band decided to become a punk rock band, changing their name at first to the Subversives but later modifying it to the U.K. Subs.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fortnam |first1=Ian |title=U.K. Subs frontman Charlie Harper looks back on four decades at punk's frontline |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/a-street-punk-named-charlie-harper |website=Louder |access-date=18 March 2021}}</ref><ref name="cure"/> The band consisted of founder [[Charlie Harper (singer)|Charlie Harper]], guitarist [[Nicky Garratt]], bassist Paul Slack, and a drummer who went under the name Rory Lyons.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0907/S00088.htm |title=UK Subs Return To New Zealand & Australia |work=[[Scoop (news website)|scoop.co.nz]] |date=8 July 1009 |access-date=10 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709203135/http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0907/S00088.htm |archive-date=9 July 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> By the time the band recorded their first single, Pete Davies had replaced Lyons and was the band's regular drummer.<ref>Parker, Alan, liner notes of ''Original Punks, Original Hits'', Demon Music Group Ltd, MCDLX023 (2006)</ref>

Their style combined the energy of punk and the [[rock and roll]] edge of the then-thriving [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] scene. The band's first six [[chart-topper|hit]] singles, including "Stranglehold", "Warhead", "Teenage", and "Tomorrow's Girls", all managed to enter the Top 40 of the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1203}}</ref> Their first four albums would also make the U.K. charts. However, they never had another single or album make the charts after 1981.

The first two songs released by the band were on the April 1978, ''Farewell to the Roxy'' album.<ref>Parker, Alan, liner notes of ''Original Punks, Original Hits'', Demon Music Group Ltd, MCDLX023 (2006)</ref> The two songs, "I Live in a Car" and "Telephone Numbers," were recorded live at a December 31, 1977 show at The Roxy. The U.K. Subs were the first band on the bill at the show that night with Rory Lyons on drums.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fortnam |first1=Ian |title=U.K. Subs frontman Charlie Harper looks back on four decades at punk's frontline |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/a-street-punk-named-charlie-harper |website=Louder |access-date=18 March 2021}}</ref> The recording of this show was later released as the album ''Live Kicks'' in 1980.

In 1978, the band released their first single, "CID," on City Records, a UK-based underground label.<ref>Parker, Alan, liner notes of ''Original Punks, Original Hits'', Demon Music Group Ltd, MCDLX023 (2006)</ref> The band played two [[John Peel]] [[jam session|session]]s in 1978, along with another a third in June 1979, for [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref name="labels" /> These sessions were subsequently released together on a single album, ''Peel Sessions'', in 2003. Also, in 1978, the band played some opening [[concert|gigs]] for [[The Police]]. In 1979, [[Julien Temple]] wrote and directed a short film ''Punk Can Take It'', a parody of wartime documentaries, that consisted mainly of U.K.Subs playing live on stage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Punk Can Take It (1979)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242761/|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=3 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915123709/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242761/|archive-date=15 September 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The film was released theatrically.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPW_YxYpWwc |title=YouTube |via=YouTube |access-date=26 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529024456/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPW_YxYpWwc |archive-date=29 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== 1979–1981 ===

In May 1979, the band signed to GEM Records, a punk rock off-shoot of RCA records.<ref name="labels"/> Their first single for GEM, "Stranglehold," was released in June 1979. It was followed by "Tomorrow's Girls" which was released in August 1979.<ref>Parker, Alan, liner notes of ''Original Punks, Original Hits'', Demon Music Group Ltd, MCDLX023 (2006)</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Another Kind of Blues]],'' was released in October 1979 with their second album, ''[[Brand New Age]]'' following in April 1980. Several EPs were also released in this period and their singles "Teenage" and "Warhead" both made the U.K. charts.<ref name="Larkin"/> Their third album, a live album also released in 1980, was their biggest selling album ever.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album, ''Crash Course,'' was recorded at the Rainbow Theatre in London on 30 May 1980 during the Brand New Age tour. 

In June of 1980, Davies and Slack left the band and were replaced with bassist Alvin Gibbs and drummer Steve Roberts.<ref>Gibbs Alvin "Diminished Responsibility" Memoirs 2020 </ref> At this point some of the songs took on a more [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]-influenced edge.<ref name="Larkin"/> In February 1981, the band released their fourth album, ''Diminished Responsibility'' which was the final U.K. Subs album to chart in the U.K. In April 1981, they released the non-album single "Keep on Running (Til You Burn)," their sixth single for GEM, and the last single by the U.K. Subs to chart in the U.K.<ref>Parker, Alan, liner notes of ''Original Punks, Original Hits'', Demon Music Group Ltd, MCDLX023 (2006)</ref> It was also their last release on GEM Records as the label folded soon after.

=== 1982–1983 ===

The band recorded their next album at the rural Jacobs Studio in Farnham, Surrey in the south of England. ''Endangered Species'' was released March 19, 1982 on the band's new label, NEMS, which also folded shortly after the release of the album. Harper and Garratt both consider this album to be the U.K. Sub's best album.<ref>{{cite web |title=1997 UK, 1982, NEL6021 |url=http://www.uksubstimeandmatter.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=482&Itemid=120 |website=U.K. Subs Time & Matter |access-date=7 April 2021}}</ref> Following the recording of the album, Steve Roberts was fired at the end of 1981 and the Subs used both Mal Aisling and John Towe as replacements. The band toured the U.S. in support of the album, hoping to get signed to a U.S. label. It was their second tour of the U.S.; the first occurring in 1979.<ref>Rabid, Jack, liner notes of ''Endangered Species'', Cleopatra Records, CLO 0361 (2016)</ref> In July 1982, they became the first Western band to perform in Poland since the imposition of martial law, and the suppression of the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ensminger|first=David|title=Left of the Dial: Conversations with Punk Icons|publisher=PM Press|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLcE5jSSC_EC&q=punk+poland&pg=PT97|isbn=9781604866414|access-date=26 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228201505/http://books.google.com/books?id=TLcE5jSSC_EC&pg=PT97&dq=U.K.+Subs+punk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MuWTUZXcIvDyyAGQpoHQDQ&ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=punk%20poland&f=false|archive-date=28 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Their concert was held in [[Gdańsk]], and they were supported by [[Brygada Kryzys]].<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd| location= London| page= 368| id= CN 5585}}</ref>

In 1983, the band released the three-song Shake Up the City EP on Abstract Records, also recorded at Jacobs studios. Drummer Kim Wylie played on the EP and for the subsequent tours of the U.K., Europe, and the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |title=7" Singles Shake Up The City |url=http://www.uksubstimeandmatter.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=482&Itemid=120 |website=U.K. Subs Time & Matter |access-date=7 April 2021}}</ref> They again played several concerts in Poland in 1983 with new wave polish band [[Republika (band)|Republika]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://republika.art.pl/alex_1983.html|title=Republika – "Gwiazdy, komety & czad".

===Album Titles and Recent Releases===

Successive U.K. Subs album titles start with consecutive letters of the alphabet, although the band released several live albums and compilations that were not part of the 26 alphabetical titles. Their 20 studio albums are all part of this 26 album sequence which also includes four live albums, ''Peel Sessions'' which compiled their three late 90's sessions with John Peel, and the compilation, ''Sub Mission: The Best of the U.K. Subs 1982–1998,'' which also contained a bonus disc with a live recording from a show in Bristol in 1991. In May 2016, the band released an album starting with the letter "Z", ''Ziezo,'' which completed their alphabetical series of album titles. ''Ziezo'' was recorded in November 2015 at Perry Vale Studios in South London. At the time, the band announced that it would be their last long playing record, although they intend to continue to release EPs and singles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fortnam |first1=Ian |title=U.K. Subs frontman Charlie Harper looks back on four decades at punk's frontline |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/a-street-punk-named-charlie-harper |website=Louder |access-date=18 March 2021}}</ref> The band funded the final album through the Crowdfunding site Pledge Music starting on 1 November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=UK Subs Facebook Video (2015)|url=https://www.facebook.com/UKSubs/videos/940566786017092/|publisher=Facebook|access-date=24 October 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}</ref>

The Subs released a double single in 2017 and an EP in 2018 in addition to two albums of covers which were released in 2018 and 2019. In January 2021, Alvin Gibbs announced on behalf of the U.K. Subs that the band had begun recording a new album due to the large amount of new material they have written as both a band and individually. He stated that the album will be released on Cleopatra Records and will be entitled ''Reverse Engineering.'' He also said that the new album "will categorically be the last ever UK Subs album."<ref>{{cite web |title=28/01: FINAL 'ENCORE' SUBS STUDIO ALBUM BEING RECORDED |url=https://www.uksubstimeandmatter.net/ |website=U.K. Subs Time & Matter |access-date=10 April 2021}}</ref>

=== 1984–present ===

In 1991, U.K. Subs also had [[Lars Frederiksen]] (now of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]) on guitar for a 30 date UK tour. Decades after the disbanding of other late-1970s punk groups such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]], U.K. Subs continue to perform.

The U.K. Subs song "Down on the Farm" was [[cover version|covered]] by [[Guns N' Roses]] on their 1993 covers album ''[["The Spaghetti Incident?"]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> U.K. Subs joined the bill for the 2006 Fiend Fest. The band have toured with [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]], [[The Adicts]], [[Osaka Popstar]], [[Agent Orange]], and [[Ramones|The Ramones]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The U.K. Subs song "Warhead" is played in the movie, ''[[This Is England]]''. U.K. Subs are one of the regular bands to play the Rebellion Festival nearly every year since its origins as The Holidays in the Sun Festival in 1996.

In 2007, drummer Jamie Oliver was a contestant on the UK quiz show [[Nothing But the Truth (UK game show)|Nothing But the Truth]]. Vocalist Charlie Harper was among the panel of witnesses. Oliver reached the £5000 mark, but lost it all in a bid to double his winnings.

In recent years, the band's work has been critical of British politician [[Nick Clegg]], with the 2013 song "Coalition Government Blues" describing the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]' leader as "liking his perks". The band's 2015 album ''Yellow Leader'' was widely suspected of referring to Clegg, with yellow being the official colour of his political party.

To celebrate 40 years since its release, [[Demon Records]] issued a special edition copy of ''Another Kind Of Blues'' in a box set of two 10" coloured vinyl on 13 April 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/UK-Subs-Another-Kind-Of-Blues/release/13491524|title=U.K. Subs* - Another Kind Of Blues|website=Discogs.com|access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> This was soon followed by the next album in succession, ''Brand New Age'' on 12 July 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/UK-Subs-Brand-New-Age/release/13926677|title=U.K. Subs* - Brand New Age|website=Discogs.com|access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> ''Crash Course'' and ''Diminished Responsibility'' have also been reissued and [[Cleopatra Records]] has released an expanded version of ''Endangered Species''.  In September 2021, to celebrate 40 years since the band's concert at Gossips, the official live cassette of the show was released on CD and Download as Danger: The Chaos Tape via Cherry Red.

On October 17, 2021 Alvin Gibbs announced on [[Facebook]] that "Charlie Harper, Steve Straughan and I have decided Jamie Oliver will no longer continue as drummer for the UK Subs" over his "his post seemingly celebrating the tragic and abhorrent death of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of parliament|MP]], [[David Amess]]".<ref>https://www.facebook.com/groups/uksubsfanclub/posts/10166025065805038/</ref>. [[Anti-Pasti]] drummer, Kevin Nixon, agreed to temporarily take over the role vacated by Oliver, enabling the band to meet live commitments in France in October, 2021.
