==Career==
VHS Collection's three members have known each other since childhood.  Conor Cook and James Bohannon attended the same middle school in New York City, while James and Nils Vanderlip attended the same high school.<ref name="Orfield2017">{{cite news |last1=Orfield |first1=Elana |title=Electro-rock trio VHS Collection talk bunking up together on tour |url=http://www.fouroverfour.jukely.com/artist/vhs-collection-interview/ |accessdate=15 October 2019 |work=Four Over Four |date=8 August 2017}}</ref>

In 2015, VHS Collection began performing live at friends' parties and around NYC's Lower East Side rock clubs, eventually selling out multiple headline shows at the NYC's [[Mercury Lounge]].  The band did not have any music out at this time, but had developed a sound at that fuses modern and retro sonics, made use of synthesizers and guitars, and blended electronic and alt-rock aesthetics.<ref name="Gokhman2019">{{cite news |last1=Gokhman |first1=Roman |title=Noise Pop Review: VHS Collection shows an '80s highlight reel at the Independent |url=http://www.riffmagazine.com/reviews/vhs-collection-20190302/ |accessdate=15 October 2019 |work=RIFF Magazine |date=3 March 2019}}</ref>
