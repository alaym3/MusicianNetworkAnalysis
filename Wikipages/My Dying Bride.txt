'''My Dying Bride''' are an English [[doom metal]] band formed in [[Bradford]]. Since their inception in 1990, they have released 13  studio albums, three EPs, one demo, one box set, four compilation albums, one live album, and one live CD/DVD release.

Along with [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]] and [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], My Dying Bride were a forerunner of the [[death doom metal]] and [[gothic metal]] genres during the early 1990s. These bands comprise "The Peaceville Three" as all were signed to [[Peaceville Records]] at the time.

==History==
===Early years (1990–1992)===
My Dying Bride was formed in [[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]], England, in June 1990,<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=311}}</ref> after guitarist [[Andrew Craighan]] and drummer Rick Miah co-formed the band after they had split from Abiosis, joining vocalist [[Aaron Stainthorpe]] and guitarist Calvin Robertshaw while ending Abiosis. After six months of rehearsing, the band recorded and released their demo, ''[[Towards the Sinister]]'', which was produced by Tim Walker of Voltage Records. Its title was taken from a line in the song "[[Symphonaire Infernus et Spera Empyrium]]". The band then released their first single, "[[God Is Alone]]", on a small French label called Listenable.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> After the single had sold out almost immediately, they were picked up by [[Peaceville Records]], and they could release their first EP, ''Symphonaire Infernus et Spera Empyrium'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> which also featured their latest recruit, bassist [[Adrian Jackson (musician)|Adrian Jackson]]. The EP was soon followed by their first album, ''[[As the Flower Withers]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

===''Turn Loose the Swans'' (1992–1994)===
''As the Flower Withers'' was followed by a big tour in the UK and the mainland Europe, and in 1992 they recorded their next EP, ''[[The Thrash of Naked Limbs]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Another tour was planned, but cancelled when their current drummer had a bad fall while shooting the accompanying video. In 1993, [[Martin Powell]] joined as My Dying Bride's keyboardist and violinist, and they started the recording of their second studio album, ''[[Turn Loose the Swans]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> With the joining of Martin Powell, the usage of violin increased even more since their ''As the Flower Withers'' album. The album was released in 1994 followed by a tour and another EP, ''[[I Am the Bloody Earth]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

===''The Angel and the Dark River'' (1995)===
1995 saw the release of My Dying Bride's next album, ''[[The Angel and the Dark River]]''. The album was followed with a successful tour with some of their first festival gigs, and soon after the fans saw the release of their first compilation album, ''[[Trinity (My Dying Bride album)|Trinity]]'', a collection of songs from their first three EPs. In the end of 1995, My Dying Bride traveled on a three-month tour with [[Iron Maiden]].

===''Like Gods of the Sun'' (1996–1997)===
''[[Like Gods of the Sun]]'' continued in the direction of ''The Angel and the Dark River'', in that it did not contain any growling vocals by Aaron Stainthorpe.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> This was the fourth album of My Dying Bride, featuring songs like "A Kiss to Remember", "For You" and "For My Fallen Angel". "For My Fallen Angel" is strictly an orchestral composition with sections of violin and synth.  It is also the last MDB album to feature a violin, until ''[[For Lies I Sire]]''.

===''34.788%...Complete'' and hiatus (1998–2001)===
The somewhat experimental ''[[34.788%...Complete]]'' was next, followed by ''[[The Light at the End of the World (My Dying Bride album)|The Light at the End of the World]]''. My Dying Bride entered a hiatus after this, releasing two retrospective albums ''[[Meisterwerk 1]]'' and ''[[Meisterwerk 2]]''. The ''Meisterwerk'' albums are compilations that contain previously released and rare material from My Dying Bride.  At the end of the hiatus, Calvin Robertshaw left the band to become their tour manager and was replaced by [[Hamish Glencross]].

===''The Dreadful Hours'' (2001–2004)===
Originally released in 2001, ''[[The Dreadful Hours]]'' featured new material with the seventh release.  The album was again engineered by Mags and co-produced by guitarist [[Andrew Craighan]].  Between 2003 and 2004, the band's label, [[Peaceville]], re-released their entire back-catalogue in [[digipak]] format, with bonus tracks consisting of demos, remixes, and live performances added to each release (except "The Light at the End of the World").

===''Songs of Darkness Words of Light'' (2004–2005)===
2004's follow-up was ''[[Songs of Darkness Words of Light]]''.

The band's next release came in May 2005, when they released the fancifully titled ''[[Anti-Diluvian Chronicles]]'', a fully-fledged ''best of'' box set featuring three discs and thirty tracks.

===''A Line of Deathless Kings'' (2006–2007)===
The band spent the winter of 2005/2006 writing material for new studio album ''[[A Line of Deathless Kings]]''. The album was released on 9 October 2006. It was preceded by the EP ''[[Deeper Down]]'' on 18 September. Shortly before the release of ''A Line of Deathless Kings'', Shaun Taylor-Steels announced his permanent departure from the band due to persistent problems with his ankle.

In early 2007, Jackson announced his departure and session-drummer [[John Bennett (drummer)|John Bennett]] from [[The Prophecy (band)|The Prophecy]] could no longer stay, citing a lack of time due to work commitments. Replacements were found in Lena Abé on bass and [[Dan Mullins]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=67524 |title=My Dying Bride Parts Ways With Bassist, Drummer; Replacements Announced |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2015-07-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606175123/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=67524 |archive-date=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In November 2008, My Dying Bride began work on their tenth studio album, entitled ''[[For Lies I Sire]]'', which was released on 23 March 2009. Due to [[Sarah Stanton (keyboardist)|Sarah Stanton]]'s pregnancy, she had been replaced on keyboards by Katie Stone, she performed violin on ''For Lies I Sire''. Soon after the album's release, she was replaced by [[Shaun MacGowan]].

On 26 October 2009, My Dying Bride released an EP/DVD titled ''[[Bring Me Victory]]''. Except for the title track and its video, it also includes a doom metal cover of the traditional song ''[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair]]'', a cover of "Failure" by [[Swans (band)|Swans]] and a live version of ''Vast Choirs'' (originally from [[As the Flower Withers]]), performed at [[Graspop]] 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BlabberMouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=125993 |title=My Dying Bride : More New EP Details Revealed; Video Still Available |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2015-07-11 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of My Dying Bride's existence, the album ''[[Evinta]]'' was released on 30 May 2011. ''Evinta'' featured some previous My Dying Bride material re-worked as neo-classical and ambient songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=59278 |title=My Dying Bride Announces 20th Anniversary Album ''Evinta'' |publisher=Metalunderground.com |access-date=2015-07-11}}</ref> Soon after, the band announced the release of the EP ''[[The Barghest o' Whitby]]'', which was released 7 November 2011, and consists of a single, 27-minute track.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.peaceville.com/mydyingbride/thebarghestowhitby/|title= My Dying Bride's 'The Barghest O' Whitby|publisher= [[Peaceville Records]]|access-date= 16 October 2011|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111016165510/http://www.peaceville.com/mydyingbride/thebarghestowhitby/|archive-date= 16 October 2011|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=71474|title= My Dying Bride Announces New EP "The Barghest O' Whitby"|publisher= metalunderground.com|date= 6 September 2011|access-date= 16 October 2011}}</ref>

On 13 May 2013, the band released a four-track EP, ''[[The Manuscript (EP)|The Manuscript]]''.

===''Feel the Misery'' and move to Nuclear Blast (2015–2019)===
[[File:Hammer of Doom X Würzburg My Dying Bride 5.jpg|upright|thumb|Calvin Robertshaw, 2015]]
On 18 September 2015, ''[[Feel the Misery]]'' was released, with eight tracks. In March 2017, the band signed with [[Nuclear Blast Records]].

In 2017, after cancelling four festival appearances, Aaron Stainthorpe explained that the band was working on a new album, and had therefore not disbanded.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/my-dying-bride-frontman-shoots-down-split-rumors/|title=MY DYING BRIDE Frontman Shoots Down Split Rumors|date=2017-10-26|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}</ref> In a My Dying Bride Facebook post on 18 September 2018, Aaron Stainthorpe explained that the band cancelled those shows due to the cancer of his 5-year-old daughter, who is presently in remission.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/my-dying-bride-singer-opens-up-about-5-year-old-daughters-cancer-diagnosis|title=MY DYING BRIDE Singer Opens Up About 5-Year-Old Daughter's Cancer Diagnosis|access-date=18 September 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

On 4 December 2018, the band announced that Shaun Steels had been replaced by [[Jeff Singer]] due to "unresolvable drumming issues" and that the drum tracks for the new album had been completed by Singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/my-dying-bride-parts-ways-with-drummer-shaun-steels-announces-replacement/|title=MY DYING BRIDE Parts Ways With Drummer SHAUN STEELS, Announces Replacement|date=4 December 2018|access-date=4 December 2018|website=blabbermouth.net}}</ref>

My Dying Bride's 13th album, ''[[The Ghost of Orion]]'', was released on 6 March 2020. It was released five years after their previous effort, ''[[Feel the Misery]]'', which is the band's longest gap between studio albums to date.
