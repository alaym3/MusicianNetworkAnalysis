==Background==
Kemirgent and Sürmen recorded the band's first six songs as a duo, and released them as the ''Son Feci EP''. Later, Efe Güner (bass guitar) and Erkin Sağsen (guitar) joined the band, and they played their first concert in Ankara. In the same period, they got to the last ten in the second “Be the Band” competition, sponsored by Babajim Istanbul Studios, as well as reaching the finals in the Roxy Music Awards.

In 2012, Ozan Özgül replaced Efe Güner as their bass guitarist, and the band released four new singles. In 2015, they released an album called ''Vesaire'', and performed live many cities in support of the album. In 2016 they released another single called "Sıkıntı Var" (English: ''"There is a problem"'').
In June 2016, the band took a break from live performances because the lead vocalist and guitarist Arda Kemirgent went into [[military service]]. During this time they released two more new singles named "Zaman Yok" (Eng: "No time") and "Reklamlar" (Eng: "Advertisements").
