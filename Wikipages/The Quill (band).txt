'''The Quill''' are a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[stoner rock]]/[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band.

==Biography==
The Quill was formed in the early 1990s by singer Magnus Ekwall, guitarist Christian Carlsson, drummer George Atlagic, [[organist]] Anders Haglund and bassist Peter Holm. The Quill played the Swedish barcircuit the following years. Peter Holm left the band at the end of 1993 and was replaced by [[Roger Nilsson]]. After writing material for half a year they entered Berno studio in [[Malmö]] and recorded their self-titled debut ''[[The Quill (album)|The Quill]]'' in three weeks.<ref name="bio">{{cite web

After signing a recorddeal with [[Megarock Records]] their debut was released in [[Europe]] in March 1995. A video for the track "Jet of water" was recorded. The album got an overwhelming reception by the critics and was later voted number 70 in Sweden's biggest newspaper "[[Aftonbladet]]" poll, Top 100 albums of the year. Other reviews that can be mentioned: 4 out of 5 in Raw, 81 out of 100 in ''[[Burrn!]]'' magazine.<ref name="bio" />

After a short promotion tour in Sweden with [[Abstrakt Algebra]], The Quill played the [[Sweden Rock Festival|Karlshamn Rockfestival]]. A tour in [[Germany]] was booked but was later cancelled due to some trouble with the record company. Instead The Quill played some more festivals in Sweden. After playing all over Sweden for almost a year the band started working on the next album. In May 1997 Anders Haglund decided to leave the band, the others feeling no need of a new organ player decided to continue as a four piece band. In August 1997 the band again entered Berno Studio in Malmö and started working on the second album ''Silver Haze''. A month later the band had recorded 13 new songs.<ref name="bio" />

Since the release of the album was delayed and The Quill had written some new songs that they wanted on the album, so they re-entered Berno Studios in the summer of 1998 and recorded the tracks "Grand Canyon, "Under a vow" and "Mercury". At the same session they also recorded the song "A Sinner's Fame" originally made by the band [[Trouble (band)|Trouble]], and the song "Fairies Wear Boots" originally recorded by Black Sabbath. During the autumn of 1998 they did a smaller tour of Sweden.<ref name="bio" />

The beginning of 1999 finally saw the release of the second album entitled ''Silver Haze''. The summer also saw the release of a 10" EP called ''[[Evermore (The Quill album)|Evermore]]'' on [[Froghouse records]] as well as a praised performance at Sweden Rock Festival. During the summer the band entered Berno Studios twice recording their versions of "Where Eagles Dare" by [[Iron Maiden]], "Frozen Over" by [[Captain Beyond]] and "Mount Everest" by [[November (band)|November]].<ref name="bio" />

In 2000 The Quill re-released their first album on both CD and vinyl. It was released by Meteorcity in the US and People Like U in Europe. Shortly thereafter the band announced that they reached an agreement with German label SPV/Steamhammer and Japanese label JVC/Victor. Once again the band entered Berno Studios and recorded their third album, which came to be titled ''Voodoo Caravan'' when released in 2002. By many fans seen as the quintessential The Quill album it also feature a guest appearance by [[Spiritual Beggars]]/[[Arch Enemy]] guitarist [[Michael Amott]]. More live shows followed with an appearance at [[Wacken Open Air]] as the highlight of the year.

Wasting no time, the band quickly started working on the next album. This time the band decided to change studio and producer and ended up in Halmstad in the southwest of Sweden. Working with producer Rickard Bengtsson in Slaughterhouse Studios, the band opted for a more contemporary sound compared to previous releases. To further develop their sound, the band tapped [[In Flames]] producer Daniel Bergstrand when it came time to mix the album. Released in 2003 ''[[Hooray! It's a Deathtrip]]'' and showcased a harder and more focused selection of songs. To promote the album The Quill teamed up with Norwegian band [[Gluecifer]] and headliners [[Monster Magnet]] for an extensive European tour playing 40 shows over the course of seven weeks.

In 2005 bass-player [[Roger Nilsson]] left the band, citing exhaustion from too much touring. He was replaced by Robert Triches and the band decided to leave Sweden for the recording of fifth album ''[[In Triumph]]''. Working with producer Tommy Newton of [[Helloween]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] fame, the album was recorded in Area 51 Studios in Celle just outside Hannover, Germany. To promote the release of the album in 2006, a video was recorded for the track "Broken Man". More touring followed when the band headlined a short European tour as well as a bunch of European festivals culminating in another performance at [[Sweden Rock Festival]].

Following the end of the In Triumph period vocalist Magnus Ekwall decided to leave the band in 2007; no comments were made regarding his departure.

During 2008 and the bigger part of 2009 the band activity was at an all-time low. Drummer Jolle Atlagic joined Finnish glam-legends [[Hanoi Rocks]] during their last year of touring, culminating with a series of farewell-shows at Tavastia in Helsinki. Late 2009 the three remaining members (Atlagic, Carlsson, Triches) decided to try finding a new singer and make another album. Magnus Arnar was contacted and he joined the band mid-2010. The band's sixth album, [[Full Circle (The Quill album)|''Full Circle'']], was recorded in Grand Studios in Gävle, Sweden, during the winter 2010–11, and a new record deal was cut with German hard rock label Metalville. ''Full Circle'' was released on 24 June in Europe and 24 July in North America. Following the release the band undertook their most ambitious touring in many years, with shows taking place all over Europe and, for the first time in the band's history, the US.

April 2012 saw the comeback of bass-player [[Roger Nilsson]], who rejoined the band at the tail end of the Full Circle tour. The later part of the year was devoted to the writing and recording of the next album. Recorded in 491 Studios in Oskarshamn and Sound Society Studios in Gävle, the band set out to make an album showcasing their broad spectrum of influences. In May 2013 the seventh album titled ''Tiger Blood'' was released, again on the Metalville label. Rave reviews followed, one journalist stating: "Jam packed with catchy riffs, thumping bass lines and vocals reminiscent of Chris Cornell and [[Sammy Hagar]], this album will please even the finickiest rocker."<ref>[http://rockonphilly.com/2013/07/album-review-the-quill-tiger-blood/] {{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref>

In August 2017, the band released a new studio album called "Born From Fire", which saw the return of original vocalist Magnus Ekwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therockonline.nl/nieuwe-releases/the-quill-born-from-fire/|title=THE QUILL - Born from Fire|website=Therockonline.nl|date=29 July 2017|accessdate=17 November 2020}}</ref>

|quote = Musically, The Quill is often mentioned as a stoner rock band, but this is slightly misleading -- they do have some similarities with that genre, but they aren't a Kyuss /Fu Manchu clone like many in that crowd. Former vocalist Magnus Ekwall was a dead ringer for Chris Cornell (Soundgarden, Audioslave), and mid-period Soundgarden is possibly the closest musical reference point as well, with perhaps a few Monster Magnet-isms thrown in as well |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607150857/http://bnrmetal.com/groups/quil.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-07}}</ref><ref name="am">{{cite web

|quote = First, it is easy to spot Black Sabbath and Deep Purple. Give a listen to "Sell No Soul" for a quick example of those. They also chart into Led Zeppelin territory. Check out "(Wade Across) The Mighty River" and think Led Zeppelin III. All their influences are not so old-school, though. Indeed, tracks like "Until Earth Is Bitter Gone" showcase a Soundgarden sort of texture and "Overlord" screams Corrosion of Conformity. The group is being billed as "stoner rock," and it does exhibit healthy doses of that variant of the jam band sound, but that is certainly not the whole picture.}}</ref> but they can also be regarded as a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band.<ref name="ma">{{cite web
