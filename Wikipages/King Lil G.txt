'''Alex Gonzalez ''', better known as '''King Lil G''', is an American rapper of Mexican descent from [[South Los Angeles]], Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/king-lil-g-descendant-of-zapata-is-leading-his-own-hip-hop-revolution-6499282 | title=King Lil G, Descendant of Zapata, Is Leading His Own Hip-Hop Revolution | work=LA Weekly | date=January 20, 2016 | access-date=February 6, 2016 | author=Weiss, Jeff}}</ref> He is best known for his 2014 single "Hopeless Boy". He released albums King Enemy, Ak47 Boyz, 90's Kid and Paint The City Blue.

Alex decided to build his career independently despite receiving offers from all major labels. He maintains control over his career so that his focus on art and social awareness doesn't get watered down by the need to maximize profit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/12/king-lil-g-interview|title=Red Bull Music Academy Daily|website=daily.redbullmusicacademy.com}}</ref>

Gonzalez claims that after rap he would like to direct his own films. He already directs his own music videos which are very popular and have over 500 million views on youtube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3vtlXJpvXeRn6ls7Yrs8yw|title=9LILG|website=YouTube}}</ref>

He was influenced musically by the G-funk flavor of 90s West Coast rap about women, weed and palm trees, especially that of California hip-hop staples Tupac, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Eazy-E among others, as well as Mexican folk ballads called corridos music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.circletalentagency.com/artist/king-lil-g|title=King Lil G – Circle Talent Agency|website=Circle Talent Agency}}</ref>
