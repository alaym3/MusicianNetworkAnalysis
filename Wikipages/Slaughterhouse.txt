A '''slaughterhouse''', also called '''abattoir''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-abattoir.ogg|'|æ|b|@|t|w|ɑr}}), is a facility where animals are [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]], most often (though not always) to provide food for humans. Slaughterhouses supply meat, which then becomes the responsibility of a [[Meat packing industry|packaging facility]].

Slaughterhouses that produce meat that is not intended for human consumption are sometimes referred to as [[Knacker|''knacker's yards'']] or ''knackeries''. This is where animals are slaughtered that are not fit for human consumption or that can no longer work on a farm, such as retired [[working animal|work horses]].

Slaughtering animals on a large scale poses significant issues in terms of logistics, [[animal welfare]], and the environment, and the process must meet [[public health]] requirements. Due to public aversion in different cultures, determining where to build slaughterhouses is also a matter of some consideration.

Frequently, [[animal rights]] groups raise concerns about the methods of transport to and from slaughterhouses, preparation prior to slaughter, animal herding, and the killing itself.<ref>

==History==
[[Image:Lovis Corinth 006.jpg|thumb|In the slaughterhouse, [[Lovis Corinth]], 1893.]]
Until modern times, the slaughter of animals generally took place in a haphazard and unregulated manner in diverse places. Early maps of London show numerous [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]] in the periphery of the city, where slaughter occurred in the open air or under cover such as [[wet markets]]. A term for such open-air slaughterhouses was ''shambles'', and there are streets named "[[The Shambles]]" in some English and Irish towns (e.g., [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], [[York]], [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]]) which got their name from having been the site on which butchers killed and prepared animals for consumption. [[Fishamble Street]], Dublin was formerly a ''fish-shambles''.

===Reform movement===
The slaughterhouse emerged as a coherent institution in the 19th century.<ref name="humanecologyreview">{{cite journal|publisher=Human Ecology Review|url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her171/Fitzgerald.pdf|title=A Social History of the Slaughterhouse}}</ref> A combination of health and social concerns, exacerbated by the rapid [[urbanisation]] experienced during the [[Industrial Revolution]], led [[social reform]]ers to call for the isolation, sequester and regulation of animal slaughter. As well as the concerns raised regarding hygiene and disease, there were also criticisms of the practice on the grounds that the effect that killing had, both on the butchers and the observers, "educate[d] the men in the practice of violence and cruelty, so that they seem to have no restraint on the use of it."<ref name="HER">{{cite journal |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Amy |title=A Social History of the Slaughterhouse: From Inception to Contemporary Implications |journal=Human Ecology Review |date=2010 |volume=17 |issue=1 |page=60 |jstor=24707515 }}</ref> An additional motivation for eliminating private slaughter was to impose a careful system of regulation for the "morally dangerous" task of putting animals to death.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[Image:Smithfield Last day of Old Smithfield ILN 1855.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]] in 1855, before it was reconstructed.]]
As a result of this tension, meat markets within the city were closed and abattoirs built outside city limits. An early framework for the establishment of public slaughterhouses was put in place in Paris in 1810, under the reign of the [[Emperor Napoleon]]. Five areas were set aside on the outskirts of the city and the feudal privileges of the [[guild]]s were curtailed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hdZ2BXP2GEC|title=Meat, Modernity, and the Rise of the Slaughterhouse|author=Paula Young Lee|year=2008|publisher=UPNE|page=26|isbn=978-1584656982}}</ref>

As the meat requirements of the growing number of residents in London steadily expanded,
the meat markets both within the city and beyond attracted increasing levels of public disapproval. Meat had been traded at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]] as early as the 10th century. By 1726, it was regarded as "without question, the greatest in the world", by [[Daniel Defoe]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Defoe|first=Daniel|author-link=Daniel Defoe|title=A Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain|year=1726|page=342|isbn=978-0-300-04980-0|url=https://archive.org/details/natureofpolitics0000mast/page/342|url-access=registration}}</ref> By the middle of the 19th century, in the course of a single year 220,000 head of cattle and 1,500,000 sheep would be "violently forced into an area of five acres, in the very heart of London, through its narrowest and most crowded thoroughfares".<ref name="fm" />

[[Image:Fish market smithfield.jpg|thumb|Part of the original construction of the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]] in 1868.]]
By the early 19th century, pamphlets were being circulated arguing in favor of the removal of the livestock market and its relocation outside of the city due to the extremely low hygienic conditions<ref name="dodd">{{cite book|last=Dodd|first=George|author-link=George Dodd (19th century writer)|title=The Food of London: A Sketch of the Chief Varieties, Sources of Supply, Probable Quantities, Modes of Arrival, Processes of Manufacture, Suspected Adulteration, and Machinery of Distribution, of the Food for a Community of Two Millions and a Half|year=1856|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans|page=[https://archive.org/details/foodlondonasket00doddgoog/page/n244 228]|url=https://archive.org/details/foodlondonasket00doddgoog}}</ref> as well as the brutal treatment of the cattle.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kean|first=Hilda| author-link = Hilda Kean |title=Animal rights: political and social change in Britain since 1800|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1998|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eP9PAAAAIAAJ|page=59|chapter='Wild' domestic animals and the Smithfield Market|isbn=978-1-86189-014-6}}</ref> In 1843, the ''Farmer's Magazine'' published a petition signed by bankers, salesmen, aldermen, butchers and local residents against the expansion of the livestock market.<ref name="fm">{{cite book|title=The Farmer's Magazine|publisher=Rogerson and Tuxford, 1849|location=London|year=1849|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eP9PAAAAIAAJ|page=142}}</ref>

An [[Act of Parliament]] was eventually passed in 1852. Under its provisions, a new cattle-market was constructed in Copenhagen Fields, [[Islington]]. The new [[Metropolitan Cattle Market]] was also opened in 1855, and West Smithfield was left as waste ground for about a decade, until the construction of the new market began in the 1860s under the authority of the 1860 Metropolitan Meat and Poultry Market Act.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thornbury | first = Walter  | author-link = George Walter Thornbury  | chapter=The Metropolitan Meat-Market| title = Old and New London: Volume 2| pages = 491–96|year=1878|chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45117|access-date= 2008-02-01}}</ref> The market was designed by [[architect]] Sir [[Horace Jones (architect)|Horace Jones]] and was completed in 1868.

A [[cut and cover]] railway tunnel was constructed beneath the market to create a triangular junction with the railway between [[Blackfriars railway station|Blackfriars]] and [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]].<ref>[http://www.londonrailways.net/snowhill.htm ''Snowhill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605193008/http://www.londonrailways.net/snowhill.htm |date=2013-06-05 }} (London Railways) accessed 13 April 2009</ref> This allowed animals to be transported into the slaughterhouse by train and the subsequent transfer of animal carcasses to the Cold Store building, or direct to the meat market via lifts.

At the same time, the first large and centralized slaughterhouse in Paris was constructed in 1867 under the orders of [[Napoleon III]] at the [[Parc de la Villette]] and heavily influenced the subsequent development of the institution throughout Europe.

===Regulation and expansion===
[[File:Richardson's_abattoir.jpg|thumb|right|Blueprint for a mechanized public abattoir, designed by slaughterhouse reformer [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]].]]
These slaughterhouses were regulated by law to ensure good standards of hygiene, the prevention of the spread of disease and the minimization of needless animal cruelty. The slaughterhouse had to be equipped with a specialized water supply system to effectively clean the operating area of blood and offal. Veterinary scientists, notably [[George Fleming (veterinarian)|George Fleming]] and John Gamgee, campaigned for stringent levels of inspection to ensure that [[epizootics]] such as [[rinderpest]] (a devastating outbreak of the disease covered all of Britain in 1865) would not be able to spread. By 1874, three meat inspectors were appointed for the London area, and the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required local authorities to provide central slaughterhouses (they were only given powers to close unsanitary slaughterhouses in 1890).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The vital city: public analysis, dairies and slaughterhouses in nineteenth-century|author=Chris Otter|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2006|url=http://www.geog.canterbury.ac.nz/powerpoints/Otter%20%282006%29.pdf}}</ref> Yet the appointment of slaughterhouse inspectors and the establishment of centralised abattoirs took place much earlier in the British colonies, such as the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria. In Victoria, for example, the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/maa1850n17240.pdf ''Melbourne Abattoirs Act 1850'' (NSW)] "confined the slaughtering of animals to prescribed public abattoirs, while at the same time prohibiting the killing of sheep, lamb, pigs or goats at any other place within the city limits".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Trabsky|first1=Marc|title=Institutionalising the Public Abattoir in Nineteenth Century Colonial Society|journal=Australian Feminist Law Journal|year=2014|volume=40|issue=2|page=180|doi=10.1080/13200968.2014.981357|s2cid=142813253}}</ref>

Attempts were also made throughout the British Empire to reform the practice of slaughter itself, as the methods used came under increasing criticism for causing undue pain to the animals. The eminent physician, [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]], spent many years in developing more humane methods of slaughter. He brought into use no fewer than fourteen possible anesthetics for use in the slaughterhouse and even experimented with the use of electric current at the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]].<ref>{{DNBSupp|wstitle=Richardson, Benjamin Ward|first=D'Arcy|last= Power}}</ref> As early as 1853, he designed a lethal chamber that would gas animals to death relatively painlessly, and he founded the Model Abattoir Society in 1882 to investigate and campaign for humane methods of slaughter.

The invention of [[refrigeration]] and the expansion of transportation networks by [[steamship|sea]] and [[rail transport|rail]] allowed for the safe exportation of meat around the world.  Additionally, meat-packing millionaire [[Philip Danforth Armour]]'s invention of the "disassembly line" greatly increased the productivity and profit margin of the [[meat packing industry]]: "according to some, animal slaughtering became the first [[mass-production]] industry in the United States."  This expansion has been accompanied by increased concern about the physical and mental conditions of the workers along with controversy over the ethical and environmental implications of slaughtering animals for meat.<ref name="humanecologyreview"/>

==Design==
In the latter part of the 20th century, the layout and design of most U.S. slaughterhouses was influenced by the work of [[Temple Grandin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.grandin.com/humane/best.practices.handle.stun.html|title=Best practices for Cattle and Pig handling and stunning|website=www.grandin.com}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=May 2021}} She suggested that reducing the stress of animals being led to slaughter may help slaughterhouse operators improve efficiency and profit.<ref>Grandin, T. and Deesing, M.

Some people believe the animals can smell or hear death, however, and these may be area that need improvement, such as the use of scent masking agents or acoustical barriers.  As well, some animals in some situations may grow to learn that after their fellows are corralled in that area, their fellows never return.  An improvement could be made by detouring off some of the animals so that they return to the pack (after the odors and sounds are masked so they will return untraumatized).    A circular crowd pen and a curved chute reduced the time spent moving cattle by up to 50% (Vowles and Hollier, 1982 [Vowles, W. J., and T. J. Hollier. 1982. The influence of yard design on the movement of animals. Proc. Aust. Soc. Anim. Prod. 14:597]).</ref> so that each animal is prevented from seeing what lies ahead and just concentrates on the hind quarters of the animal in front of it. This design – along with the design elements of solid sides, solid crowd gate, and reduced noise at the end point – work together to encourage animals forward in the chute and to not reverse direction.<ref name = "Grandin-be-pr-ani_mov">{{cite web | last = Grandin | first = Temple | title = Improving the Movement of Cattle, Pigs, and Sheep during handling on farms, ranches, and slaughter plants

Solid sides which prevent the cattle from seeing people and other distractions outside the fence should be installed on the chutes (races) and the crowd pen which leads up to the single file chute. The use of solid sides is especially important in slaughter plants, truck loading ramps, and other places where there is much activity outside the fence. Solid sides are essential in slaughter plants to block the animal's view of people and equipment.

A curved chute (race) with solid sides at a ranch facility. It works better than a straight chute because cattle think they are going back to where they came from. The outer fence is solid to prevent the cattle from seeing distractions outside the fence... The facility must be located in a pasture that has no nearby equipment, moving vehicles or extra people, or put inside a building that has solid side walls. In many facilities, adding solid fences will improve animal movement...

Solid sides in these areas help prevent cattle from becoming agitated when they see activity outside the fence – such as people. Cattle tend to be calmer in a chute with solid sides.

Cattle move more easily through the curved race system because they can not see people and other distractions ahead.</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=May 2021}}

{{as of|2011}}, Grandin claimed to have designed over 54% of the slaughterhouses in the United States as well as many others around the world.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Mobile design===
Beginning in 2008 the Local Infrastructure for Local Agriculture, a non-profit committed to revitalizing opportunities for "small farmers and strengthening the connection between local supply and demand",<ref name="Muhlke">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/magazine/23food-t-000.html|title=A Movable Beast|first=Christine|last=Muhlke|date=20 May 2010|access-date=8 January 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> constructed a mobile slaughterhouse facility in efforts for small farmers to process meat quickly and cost effectively. Named the Modular Harvest System, or M.H.S., it received [[USDA]] approval in 2010. The M.H.S. consists of three separate trailers: One for slaughtering, one for consumable body parts, and one for other body parts. Preparation of individual cuts is done at a butchery or other meat preparation facility.<ref name="Muhlke"/>

==International variations==
[[File:Atria slaughterhouse in Nurmo Seinajoki.JPG|thumb|A slaughterhouse of [[Atria Oyj]] in [[Seinäjoki]], [[Finland]]]]
The standards and regulations governing slaughterhouses vary considerably around the world. In many countries the slaughter of animals is regulated by custom and tradition rather than by law. In the non-Western world, including the [[Arab world]], the [[Indian sub-continent]], etc., both forms of meat are available: one which is produced in modern [[mechanization|mechanized]] slaughterhouses, and the other from local [[butcher]] shops.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}}

In some communities animal slaughter and permitted species may be controlled by [[religious law]]s, most notably ''[[halal]]'' for [[Muslim]]s and [[Kosher|''kashrut'']] for [[Jew]]ish communities. This can cause conflicts with national regulations when a slaughterhouse adhering to the rules of religious preparation is located in some [[Western countries]]. In Jewish law, captive bolts and other methods of pre-slaughter paralysis are generally not permissible, due to it being forbidden for an animal to be stunned prior to slaughter. Various halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed fail-safe system of head-only [[stunning]] where the shock is non-fatal, and where it is possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock. The use of [[electronarcosis]] and other methods of dulling the sensing has been approved by the Egyptian Fatwa Committee. This allows these entities to continue their religious techniques while keeping accordance to the national regulations.<ref name="egyptianfatwacommittee">{{cite web |publisher=Egyptian Fatwaa Committee |url=http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/fatwa-stunning.php |title=The Opinions of the Ulema on the Permissibility of Stunning Animals |date=December 18, 1978 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202233118/http://www.organic-halal-meat.com/article/fatwa-stunning.php |archive-date=December 2, 2012 }}</ref>

In some societies, traditional cultural and religious aversion to slaughter led to prejudice against the people involved. In [[Japan]], where the ban on slaughter of livestock for food{{Specify|date=April 2010}} was lifted in the late 19th century, the newly found slaughter industry drew workers primarily from villages of ''[[burakumin]]'', who traditionally worked in occupations relating to death (such as executioners and undertakers). In some parts of [[Honshu|western Japan]], prejudice faced by current and former residents of such areas (''burakumin'' "hamlet people") is still a sensitive issue. Because of this, even the Japanese word for "slaughter" (屠殺 ''tosatsu'') is deemed [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] by some [[Advocacy group|pressure group]]s as its inclusion of the [[kanji]] for "kill" (殺) supposedly portrays those who practice it in a negative manner.

Some countries have laws that exclude specific animal species or grades of animal from being slaughtered for human consumption, especially those that are [[Taboo food and drink|taboo food]]. The former [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] suggested in 2004 introducing legislation banning the slaughter of cows throughout [[India]], as [[Hinduism]] holds [[Cattle in religion|cows as sacred]] and considers their slaughter unthinkable and offensive. This was often opposed on grounds of religious freedom. The slaughter of cows and the importation of beef into the nation of [[Nepal]] are strictly forbidden.

===Freezing works===
Refrigeration technology allowed meat from the slaughterhouse to be preserved for longer periods. This led to the concept as the slaughterhouse as a freezing works. Prior to this, canning was an option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techhistory.co.nz/19thcentury/Meat.htm|title=The 19th Century Heritage: the meat industry|website=www.techhistory.co.nz|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref> Freezing works are common in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. In countries where meat is exported for a substantial profit the freezing works were built near docks, or near transport infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/98181|title=7.

Mobile poultry processing units (MPPUs) follow the same principles, but typically require only one trailer and, in much of the United States, may legally operate under USDA exemptions not available to red meat processors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sare.org/Learning-Center/SARE-Project-Products/Northeast-SARE-Project-Products/Building-an-On-Farm-Poultry-Processing-Facility|title=Building an On-Farm Poultry Processing Facility|website=www.sare.org|access-date=6 June 2020}}</ref> Several MPPUs have been in operation since before 2010, under various models of operation and ownership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nichemeatprocessing.org/mobile-poultry-processing-units-reports-from-the-field/|title=Mobile Poultry Processing Units: Reports From the Field|website=www.www.nichemeatprocessing.org|access-date=6 June 2020}}</ref>

Most countries have laws in regard to the treatment of animals in slaughterhouses. In the [[United States]], there is the [[Humane Slaughter Act]] of 1958, a law requiring that all swine, sheep, cattle, and horses be stunned unconscious with application of a stunning device by a trained person before being hoisted up on the line. There is some debate over the enforcement of this act. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as [[kashrut|kosher]] [[shechita]]{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and [[Dhabihah|dhabiha halal]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Most strict interpretations of kashrut require that the animal be fully sensible when its [[carotid artery]] is cut.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' presented a fictionalized account of unsanitary conditions in slaughterhouses and the meatpacking industry during the 1800s. This led directly to an investigation commissioned directly by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and to the passage of the [[Meat Inspection Act]] and the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906, which established the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. A much larger body of regulation deals with the public health and worker safety regulation and inspection.

Starting in the 1980s, [[Cargill]], [[Conagra Brands]], [[Tyson Foods]] and other large food companies moved most slaughterhouse operations to rural areas of the [[Southern United States]] which were more hostile to unionization efforts.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nibert |first=David |editor1=Steven Best|editor2=Richard Kahn|editor3=Anthony J.

In 1997, Gail Eisnitz, chief investigator for the Humane Farming Association (HFA),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hfa.org/|title=HFA – The Humane Farming Association|website=www.hfa.org |access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref> released a book ''Slaughterhouse''. Within, she unveils the interviews of slaughterhouse workers in the U.S. who say that, because of the speed with which they are required to work, animals are routinely skinned while apparently alive and still blinking, kicking and shrieking. Eisnitz argues that this is not only cruel to the animals but also dangerous for the human workers, as cows weighing several thousands of pounds thrashing around in pain are likely to kick out and debilitate anyone working near them.<ref>Eisnitz, Gail A. ''Slaughterhouse''. Prometheus Books, 1997, cited in Torres, Bob. ''Making a Killing''. AK Press, 2007, p. 46.</ref>

This would imply that certain slaughterhouses throughout the country are not following the guidelines and regulations spelled out by the ''[[Humane Slaughter Act]]'', requiring all animals to be put down and thus insusceptible to pain by some form, typically electronarcosis, before undergoing any form of violent action.

According to the HFA, Eiznitz interviewed slaughterhouse workers representing over two million hours of experience, who, without exception, told her that they have beaten, strangled, boiled and dismembered animals alive or have failed to report those who do. The workers described the effects the violence has had on their personal lives, with several admitting to being physically abusive or taking to alcohol and other drugs.<ref name="HFA">[https://hfa.org/hot_topic/slaughterhouse.html "HFA Exposé Uncovers Federal Crimes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519182758/http://www.hfa.org/hot_topic/slaughterhouse.html |date=2009-05-19 }}, Humane Farming Association. Retrieved March 8, 2008.</ref>

The HFA alleges that workers are required to kill up to 1,100 hogs an hour and end up taking their frustration out on the animals.<ref name="HFA"/> Eisnitz interviewed one worker, who had worked in ten slaughterhouses, about pig production. He told her:

{{quote|sign=|source=|"Hogs get stressed out pretty easy. If you prod them too much, they have heart attacks. If you get a hog in the chute that's had the shit prodded out of him and has a heart attack or refuses to move, you take a [[meat hook]] and hook it into his [[anus|bunghole]]. You try to do this by clipping the [[hipbone]]. Then you drag him backwards. You're dragging these hogs alive, and a lot of times the meat hook rips out of the bunghole. I've seen [[ham]]s – [[thigh]]s – completely ripped open. I've also seen [[intestines]] come out. If the hog collapses near the front of the chute, you shove the meat hook into his [[cheek]] and drag him forward."<ref>Eisnitz, p. 82, cites in Torres, Bob. ''Making a Killing''. AK Press, 2007, p. 47.</ref>}}

[[Animal rights movement|Animal rights activists]], [[Anti-speciesism|anti-speciesists]], [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] and [[Veganism|vegans]] are prominent critics of slaughterhouses and have created events such as the [[march to close all slaughterhouses]] to voice concerns about the conditions in slaughterhouses and ask for their abolition. Some have argued that humane animal slaughter is impossible.<ref>
