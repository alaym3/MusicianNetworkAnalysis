'''Lord of the Lost''' is a German [[gothic metal]] band from [[Hamburg]]. The band was formed by singer and frontman Chris Harms.

== History ==
Lord of the Lost was founded in mid-2007 by Chris Harms as a solo project. While working on the initial songs and publishing them on MySpace, Harms received a lot of positive reception and realized that he would require a full band to play them live. He recruited other musicians from his friends in the Hamburg music scene to form the band and begin working on the first album.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Marjon Smaling(videographer) |date=9 April 2010 | title=Rockpics.nl presents an interview with Lord of the Lost | access-date=6 September 2017 | medium=video |location=Osnabrück}}</ref> Harms originally called the project ''Lord'', but changed the name of the band to Lord of the Lost to avoid possible name disputes with [[Lordi]] and [[The Lords (German band)|The Lords]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stahl|first1=Pamela|title=Interview mit Chris Harms (Lord of the Lost)|url=http://www.mindbreed.de/interviews/lord-of-the-lost/|website=Mindbreed Onlinemagazin|access-date=7 September 2017|date=21 February 2010| language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|date=October 2009|magazine=[[Sonic Seducer]]|title=Lord of the Lost - Unsterblich durch Musik|page=22|language=de}}</ref> Before Lord of the Lost, Harms was a singer and guitarist of the rock band Philiae (1999–2004), a guitarist and second singer with the [[glam metal]] band The Pleasures (2004–2007), as well as a musician on various projects like Big Boy or Unterart.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=March 2010|magazine=[[Sonic Seducer]]|title=Fürchte nicht die Angst|page=26|language=de}}</ref>

The debut single ''Dry the Rain'' was released in 2009 and the debut album ''Fears'' was released in 2010 with the independent label [[Out of Line]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reuter|first1=Swen|title=Rezension: LORD OF THE LOST - FEARS|url=http://powermetal.de/review/review-Lord_Of_The_Lost/Fears,15877.html|website=Powermetal.de|access-date=7 September 2017|date=19 February 2010|language=de}}</ref> While recording the second album ''Antagony'' Lord of the Lost went on an extended tour through 2010 which included international shows and festivals such as the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]], the [[Wacken Open Air]] and the [[M'era Luna Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lord of the Lost Setlist at Kohlrabizirkus, Leipzig, Germany|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/lord-of-the-lost/2010/kohlrabizirkus-leipzig-germany-63d1b263.html|website=setlist.fm|access-date=7 September 2017|date=22 May 2010}}</ref>

In summer 2012, Lord of the Lost released their third album ''Die Tomorrow''. Just before the release, the band began working on their fourth album ''From the Flame into the Fire''. In October 2012, Lord of the Lost opened for [[Letzte Instanz]] on their ''Ewig''-Tour. Lord of the Lost started touring again in the spring of 2013 co-headlining on the ''Darkness Kills'' tour with Unzucht, and in September kicked off the ''We Are the Lost'' tour together with Lost Area. In October 2013, Lord of the Lost appeared as part of the ''Gothic Meets Klassik'' at the Leipzig Gewandhaus with the Zielona Gòra Symphony Orchestra.

In February 2014, drummer Christian Schellhorn left the band and was replaced by Tobias Mertens. In March 2014, the band played their first US tour, which was financed by crowdfunding. Within two months fans and sponsors raised US$12,775, surpassing the original goal of US$10,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Help Bring Lord Of The Lost To The USA!|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-bring-lord-of-the-lost-to-the-usa#/|website=Indiegogo|access-date=6 September 2017}}</ref>

In March 2015, Lord of the Lost released the pure acoustic album ''Swan Songs'', which reached number 34 on the [[GfK Entertainment Charts]]. The live performances for the album took place on the [[Out of Line]] Weekender in Berlin in the same month.<ref>{{cite web|title=Out of Line Weekender 2015 Setlists|url=https://www.setlist.fm/festival/2015/out-of-line-weekender-2015-2bd6c01e.html|website=setlist.fm|access-date=7 September 2017|date=29 March 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, Lord of the Lost released the EP ''Full Metal Whore''. The tour for the album used the motto "Make Love Make War" and was supported by the bands Darkhaus, Eyes Shut Tight, Vlad in Tears, and [[Erdling]]. In December 2015, they released ''A Night to Remember – Live Acoustic in Hamburg'', the DVD and live CD from the acoustic tour during the previous spring.<ref>{{cite web|title=LORD OF THE LOST: A NIGHT TO REMEMBER - LIMITED DVD+2CD|url=http://www.outofline.de/content/newsletter/newsletter091115.htm|website=outofline.de|access-date=7 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231212304/http://www.outofline.de/content/newsletter/newsletter091115.htm|archive-date=31 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''Empyrean'' was published at the end of July 2016 and is the second concept album from the band.

The band followed ''Empyrean'' with their open air concert premiere as ''The Lord of the Lost Ensemble'', an acoustic-classical band supported by classical musicians and the former drummer Christian "Disco" Schellhorn.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mecklenburg|first1=Claudia|title=Castle Rock Festival 2016 – Schloss Broich Mülheim an Ruhr – Vorbericht|url=http://vitanigra.com/castle-rock-festival-2016-schloss-broich-muelheim-an-ruhr-vorbericht/#more-24081|website=vita nigra|access-date=7 September 2017|language=de|date=14 April 2016}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Although it has not always been received as highly innovative, the debut album ''Fears'' received an overall positive critique by the music press. The music Magazine [[Sonic Seducer]] praised not only the "pleasant deep promising vocals" but also the "dark, melodramatic moments" and described the album as "dark mélange of music styles which give the album a fresh and great variety".<ref>{{Cite journal|date=March 2010|title=Lord of the Lost - Fürchte nicht die Angst|journal=Sonic Seducer|pages=27}}</ref> In [[Zillo]] the debut has been described as "not really original or ground-breaking" but it has been praised for its "hard and unconditional songs".<ref>{{Cite journal|date=April 2010|journal=Zillo|pages=67}}</ref> [[Orkus]], however, wrote that they have waited a long time for an album "so interesting and rich in variety".<ref>{{Cite journal|date=March 2010|journal=Orkus|volume=Nr. 3|pages=40}}</ref> [[Metal.de]] described the album as "absolutely okay" but suggested to listen to some songs before buying the album because it might be "too hard for some, and too soft for others".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metal.de/reviews/lord-of-the-lost-fears-14050/|title=Lord Of The Lost - Fears Review|website=[[metal.de]]|access-date=3 July 2019}}</ref>
