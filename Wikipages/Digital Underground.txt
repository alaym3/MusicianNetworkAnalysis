'''Digital Underground''' was an American [[alternative hip hop]] group from [[Oakland, California]]. Their personnel changed and rotated with each album and tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000430/Digital-Underground.html |title=Digital Underground Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |access-date=2010-08-11}}</ref>

Digital Underground's leader and mainstay was Greg "[[Shock G]]" Jacobs (also known as Humpty Hump); Shock G formed the group in 1987 with [[Chopmaster J|Jimi "Chopmaster J" Dright]] of [[Berkeley, California]], and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] hip-hop radio deejay Kenneth "Kenny-K" Waters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampahiphop.com/kenny.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608155756/http://www.tampahiphop.com/kenny.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-06-08 |title=Kenny K - Tampa Hip-Hop dot Com v2.0 |publisher=Tampahiphop.com |access-date=2010-08-11 }}</ref>

Heavily influenced by the various [[funk]] bands of the 1970s, Digital Underground sampled such music frequently, which became a defining element of West Coast rap. As "Rackadelic", Jacobs designed album covers and cartoon-laced liner notes, in [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] album designs. Digital Underground is also notable for launching the career of member [[Tupac Shakur]], as well as spinning off side projects and solo acts including [[Raw Fusion]], [[Saafir]], and singer [[Mystic (singer)|Mystic]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/digital_underground/bio.jhtml |title=Digital Underground &#124; View the Music Artists Biography Online |publisher=VH1.com |date=1963-08-25 |access-date=2010-08-11}}</ref>

Following the release of their "[[Doowutchyalike]]" single and video in the summer of 1989, the band gained popularity with their song "[[The Humpty Dance]]" in 1990. Digital Underground toured nearly every year until 2008; this consisted of live shows in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and the U.S. While the group's origins lay mostly in Oakland and Berkeley, California, various characters and voices from around the U.S and U.K. appeared on the band's albums.  Shock G and Money-B were the only individuals to appear on every album. Other recurring key contributors were David "DJ Fuze" Elliot, and deejay/producer Jeremy "J-Beats" Jackson, who both assisted Jacobs in developing the sound.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

After approximately 20 years of touring, Shock G announced that the group would officially disband in 2008. Shortly after that announcement was made, the group also confirmed that their May 2008 album ''[[..Cuz a D.U. Party Don't Stop!]]'' would be their last studio effort.<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/we-dont-die-we-multiply-heartbeat-props/ Pop Matters; We Don't Die, We Multiply]</ref>

==History==

===Formation===
Jacobs spent most of his youth in [[Tampa, Florida]] and [[New York City]]. Founded in 1987, the group's image was originally more militant, and was intended to be a tribute to social activists [[The Black Panthers]]. However, when groups like [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] and [[N.W.A]] rose to prominence, Jacobs chose to take the image in a more whimsical and upbeat direction.

===''Sex Packets''===
''[[Sex Packets]]'', the group's debut album, was released in the spring of 1990 following the success of its two lead off singles. First came "[[Doowutchyalike]]," a moderate club hit, followed by the more successful song "[[The Humpty Dance]]", a humorous dance number that reached #11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], #7 on the [[R&B]] charts, and #1 on the Billboard Rap Singles chart. It was rapped by Shock G's [[alter ego]] Humpty Hump, and featured a drum track with over 50 confirmed usages in other songs. ''Sex Packets'' features [[P-Funk]] samples, jazz-influenced interludes, and a combination of samples and live instrumentation, earning it positive reviews and [[RIAA certification|platinum]] sales.

===''This Is an EP Release''===
''[[This Is an EP Release]]'' is the RIAA Gold certified second Digital Underground release, from which two songs, "Tie the Knot" and "[[Same Song (Digital Underground song)|Same Song]]" were featured in the film ''[[Nothing But Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing But Trouble]]'' starring [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Demi Moore]], and [[John Candy]]. "Tie The Knot," features jazzy piano tracks and a comedic interpretation of "[[Bridal Chorus]]". "Same Song" has an organ solo and improvised organ bits throughout the song, making it one of hip hop's first singles to successfully integrate live instrumentation with [[music samples]]. [[Tupac Shakur]] made his debut on the latter song and portrayed an African king in the video. Tupac also can be heard joking around on the remixed version of "The Way We Swing" as a background vocalist, adding humorous ad-libs between the verses. Tupac first began to appear on stage with the group as one of its dancers and "hype men".

===''Sons of the P''===
The group's second full album featured two singles, "No Nose Job" and "Kiss You Back", the latter of which featured multi-layered choruses and background vocals sung by Boni Boyer, who briefly worked with Digital Underground shortly after her stint with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s Sign of the Times/Love Sexy band.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.discomusic.com/people-more/1552_0_11_0_C/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20031028204648/http://www.discomusic.com/people-more/1552_0_11_0_C/|url-status= dead|archive-date= October 28, 2003|title= Boni Boyer (Bonita Louisa Boyer)|author= Bernard Lopez|publisher= DiscoMusic.com|date= December 4, 1996}}</ref> Despite the fact that a choir of singers were portrayed in the video, the actual studio singing was exclusively Boni on all tracks, excluding the male voices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Boni+Boyer |title=Boni Boyer - Bio, CDs and Vinyl at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2010-08-11}}</ref> It has been mistakenly reported that "Kiss You Back" was co-written and co-performed by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/digital-underground |title=Digital Underground: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=2010-08-11}}</ref> but his name appears in the writers credit due to a sample of "(Not Just) Knee Deep" by Funkadelic being used. He did, however, actively participate in the writing and recording of the title track "Sons of the P", which he also contributed vocals to, and which marked one of the earliest studio guest appearances by Clinton on a Hip Hop release,<ref>{{cite web|last=Huff |first=Quentin B. |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/we-dont-die-we-multiply-heartbeat-props |title=We Don't Die, We Multiply: Heartbeat Props < PopMatters |publisher=Popmatters.com |access-date=2010-08-11}}</ref> which is preceded only by [[Kurtis Blow]]'s "Magilla Gorilla" released in 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tunegenie.com/bio/MN0000116388/kurtis-blow/ |title=Artist Info: Kurtis Blow |publisher=Tunegenie.com |date=1959-08-09 |access-date=2010-08-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630093646/http://www.tunegenie.com/bio/MN0000116388/kurtis-blow/ |archive-date=2012-06-30 }}</ref> Both the album and the "Kiss You Back" single were each certified Gold by the RIAA.

===''The Body-Hat Syndrome''===
With the leading single "The Return of the Crazy One," and its accompanying X-rated video, which was reworked for public consumption, gaining positive feedback, the rest of ''[[The Body-Hat Syndrome]]'' unfurled to less than outstanding crossover commercial acclaim. The album's second single, an anti-racism cultural awareness politico called "Wussup Wit the Luv," featured a solo from [[Funkadelic]] guitarist [[Michael Hampton]], as well as a verse and video appearance from Tupac Shakur. This would be the last time Tupac appeared on any Digital Underground release, while lead rappers [[Saafir]] and Clee were added to the band's line-up. This album also features "The Humpty Dance Awards", the group's humorous shout-out to the artists who sampled the Humpty Dance prior to 1993.

===''Future Rhythm''===
''[[Future Rhythm]]'', the group's fourth full album, would be their first independent release, including two songs that were featured in the Wayans brothers' film ''[[Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood]]'': "Food Fight", featuring [[Del tha Funkee Homosapien]], and "We Got More" with [[Luniz]]. The album also contains an early performance from rapper Sly Boogy, while he was still a member of the Black Spooks, who appeared on the song "Fool Get a Clue."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Black+Spooks |title=Black Spooks - Bio, CDs and Vinyl at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2010-08-11}}</ref>

===''Who Got the Gravy?''===
In 1998, eight years after the group's first album, Digital Underground released ''[[Who Got the Gravy?]]'', which reached #91 on the Top 200 R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Digital Underground being a West Coast act, the album intentionally featured several East Coast rappers at a time when the East vs. West rivalry was active, in an attempt to both ignore and ridicule it. The guests included New York City natives [[Big Pun]], [[Biz Markie]] and [[KRS-One]], and introduced Whuteva and Stylez, while also introducing west coast bay area newcomers Esinchill and female emcee [[Mystic (singer)|Mystic]].

===''..Cuz A D.U. Party Don't Stop!''===
Digital Underground's final studio album, ''[[..Cuz a D.U. Party Don't Stop!]]'', was released on May 20, 2008, although a substantial portion of it was recorded at a live show from 2005. Shortly before its release, the group embarked on an indefinite hiatus. Money-B has stated that Shock G expressed interest in writing a book and exploring music that the latter would deem unfit for the Digital Underground name.<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/music/article/interview-with-digital-undergrounds-money-b/ Interview with Digital Underground's Money-B] blogcritics.org. 2009-07-31. Retrieved on 2010-11-08.</ref>

On May 18, 2010, The Greenlight EP was released, which features some previously unreleased Digital Underground tracks.<ref>[http://mvremix.com/urban_blogs/2010/04/23/digital-underground-the-greenlight-ep-features-previously-unreleased-tracks-and-releases-may-18th/ Digital Underground â€“ The Greenlight EP features previously unreleased tracks, and releases May 18th] mvremix.com. 2010-04-23.
