'''Holy Fuck''' is a Canadian [[electronica]] band from [[Toronto]]. They were a part of [[Dependent Music]], a music label and artist collective that began in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]] in 2004 until its closing.

The band uses live instrumentation and miscellaneous instruments and non-instruments (including a 35&nbsp;mm [[film synchronizer]], toy keyboards and toy phaser guns) to achieve electronic-sounding effects without the use of laptops or programmed backing tracks.<ref>Currin, Grayson.

The memo justified the cancellation on the grounds that its recipients included, among other notables, "a rock band that uses an [[Profanity|expletive]] as part of its name", apparently referring to Holy Fuck.<ref>[http://www.friends.ca/News/Friends_News/archives/articles08270805.asp PM defends Tory track record on arts] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120801044259/http://www.friends.ca/News/Friends_News/archives/articles08270805.asp |date=2012-08-01 }}, [[David Akin]] and Juliet O'Neill, ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', August 27, 2008.
