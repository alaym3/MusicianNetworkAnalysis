Regan was hailed as a leader of the new 'Brit' folk movement, ''[[The Guardian]]'' saying "Folk has a new Pied Piper."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/aug/04/popandrock.folk | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Betty | last=Clarke | title=CD: Fionn Regan, The End of History | date=4 August 2006}}</ref>

Wicklow, Ireland to record what would become ''[[The Shadow of an Empire]]'' without any record label involvement or intrusion. Jeff Barrett of [[Heavenly Records]] was one of the first to hear the completed album and quickly signed him up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/8102344.html?new_layout=1|title=100 Acres of Sycamore|work=Hot Press|author=Tyaransen, Olaf|date=29 July 2011|access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref> Regan released the album to critical acclaim on 8 February 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/articles/616/613/2009/8/28/626167_392085110890Fionnonh.html |title=Fionn on his way to the Electric Picnic |work=The Irish News Online |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117110218/http://www.irishnews.com/articles/616/613/2009/8/28/626167_392085110890Fionnonh.html |archive-date=17 January 2016 }}</ref> achieving several four-star reviews from several publications, including '' Mojo'', ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', ''[[Hot Press]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''The Guardian'' and ''[[The Independent]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fionnregan.com/#1730523/PRESS|title=FIONN REGAN|website=Fionnregan.com|access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>

On 17 August 2012, ''Hot Press'' announced that Regan had completed his fourth studio album, ''[[The Bunkhouse Vol. 1: Anchor Black Tattoo]]''. The album was released on 7 September and Regan described the album by saying: "you can call it folk but I feel in a lot of ways it's like an Irish punk album, in that it's pure, it's stripped down." The album's themes range from the Irish Sea ("Mizen to Malin") to "the hallucinatory" ("St. Anthony's Fire").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/Fionn-Regan/news/Fionn-Regans-fourth-album-on-the-way/9102901.html|title=Fionn Regan's fourth album on the way|work=[[Hot Press]]|date=17 August 2012|access-date=18 August 2012}}</ref>

In April 2017, Regan released his fifth studio album The Meetings of the Waters via independent label Abbey Records under his imprint 'Tsuneni Ai'. The album maintains Regan's traditional folk influences but explores a theme of electronica "His first album for five years is still a folk record at heart, but one swathed in electronic orchestrations".<ref>{{Cite web|date=13 April 2017|title=Fionn Regan: The Meeting of the Waters review – experimental, ambient folk|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/13/fionn-regan-the-meeting-of-the-waters-review-experimental-ambient-folk|access-date=6 November 2020|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Perceived by many to be the "Regan's best work since his award winning debut", the album received numerous four-star reviews including: [[The Guardian]], [[The Irish Times|Irish Times]], Thank Folk for That and was nominated for the [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] Music Choice Award in 2018. To support the lead single, also titled The Meetings of the Waters, Regan released a music video starring actor [[Cillian Murphy]].
