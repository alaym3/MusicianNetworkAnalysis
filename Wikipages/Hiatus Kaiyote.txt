==History==
===2011–2013: Formation and ''Tawk Tomahawk''===
In 2010, Nai Palm (born Naomi Saalfield) performed a solo show in Melbourne that was witnessed by Paul Bender. After the show, Bender approached Palm and suggested a collaboration. After working as a duo for a short time, they recruited Perrin Moss and Simon Mavin in 2011 and formed Hiatus Kaiyote.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/backstage/backstage-articles/hiatus-kaiyote.html|title= Nooks & Crannies: Hiatus Kaiyote |website=Sydney Opera House |last=Tan |first=Teresa |date=12 December 2016 |access-date=27 July 2020}}</ref> Mavin was then a member of [[The Bamboos (funk band)|The Bamboos]] but left that band to focus on Hiatus Kaiyote. 

Hiatus Kaiyote played their first gig at the 2011 Bohemian Masquerade Ball among [[Sword swallowing|sword swallowers]], fire twirlers, and gypsy death core bands.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.pbsfm.org.au/news/8th-bohemian-masquerade-ball|title= The 8th Bohemian Masquerade Ball |website=PBS FM |date=11 March 2011 |access-date=27 July 2020}}</ref> In February 2012, the band opened for [[Taylor McFerrin]] in Melbourne. McFerrin was so impressed with them that he introduced their music to influential broadcaster and record label owner DJ [[Gilles Peterson]].<ref name="2013awards">{{Cite web |url= https://crackmagazine.net/article/news/gilles-petersons-worldwide-awards-2013/|title= Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Awards 2013 |website=Crack Magazine |date=22 January 2013 |access-date=27 July 2020}}</ref>

The band released their debut album ''Tawk Tomahawk'' independently in April 2012. It was noticed by numerous musicians including [[Animal Collective]] and [[Dirty Projectors]],<ref name="acclaimmag.com">{{cite web|title = Interview: Hiatus Kaiyote – ACCLAIM|url = http://www.acclaimmag.com/music/interview-hiatus-kaiyote/|access-date = 15 September 2015}}</ref> and the band later received public endorsements from [[Erykah Badu]], [[Questlove]], and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], who urged their social media followers to explore the band's music.<ref>{{cite web|title = Hiatus Kaiyote get a tweet of approval from Prince|url = http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/37004/Hiatus-Kaiyote-get-a-tweet-of-approval-from-Prince|access-date = 15 September 2015}}</ref> In early 2013, Gilles Peterson named them the Breakthrough Artists of the Year at his Worldwide Music Awards in London,<ref name="2013awards" /> and shortly thereafter they were introduced to [[Salaam Remi]] who had just started working as an A&R executive at [[Sony Music]]. Sony gave Remi the opportunity to start his own label, Flying Buddha, and his first signing was Hiatus Kaiyote. The band licensed ''Tawk Tomahawk'' to the label, adding an updated version of the song "Nakamarra" featuring [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]]. Following this release, the band toured internationally, and in 2014 were nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance]] for "Nakamarra."<ref name="Michael Dwyer">{{cite web|author=Michael Dwyer |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/independent-melbourne-band-hiatus-kaiyote-gets-grammy-nod-20131209-2z1hh.html |title=Independent Melbourne band Hiatus Kaiyote gets Grammy nod |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref> They were the first Australian act to be nominated for a Grammy in an R&B category.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/independent-melbourne-band-hiatus-kaiyote-gets-grammy-nod-20131209-2z1hh.html#:~:text=The%20Best%20R%26B%20Performance%20nomination,nominated%20for%20a%20Grammy%20award.|title= Grammy nod|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|last=Dwyer |first=Michael  |date=9 December 2013 |access-date=27 July 2020}}</ref> 

===2014–2016: ''Choose Your Weapon''===
{{Quote box
 |quote = Every song we make is a little world and contains a multitude of influences. Although some may refer to our songs as R&B in one moment, and electronica or proggy-tropicalia in another, we don't think about sounds in terms of genres, but look at them more from a cinematic way. We’re always trying to get to that moment where people are overwhelmed in joy, in confusion, in sadness, or in the magnitude of emotion or disbelief – as well as sometimes feeling all of these simultaneously. We like to call this "wondercore", and that's what we’re always aiming for as a group.

In 2014, the band began working on their second album, ''[[Choose Your Weapon]]'', which was released on 1 May 2015. The review aggregator [[Metacritic]] gave the album a normalized rating of 88 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".<ref name="metacritic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/choose-your-weapon/hiatus-kaiyote |title=Reviews for Choose Your Weapon by Hiatus Kaiyote|publisher=Metacritic |access-date=11 May 2015}}</ref> On 9 May 2015, ''Choose Your Weapon'' debuted at number 22 on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian albums chart]].<ref name="ARIA Australian Top 50 Albums">{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/chart/albums/78294|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Albums|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=11 May 2015|access-date=9 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032019/http://www.ariacharts.com.au/chart/albums/78294|archive-date=17 November 2015}}</ref> Nai Palm described the album as an "extension" of their debut, and stated that she and the band had no intention to make a one-genre body of work. Many of the songs on the album started with Saalfield's original ideas and were later fleshed out by the band collectively. During the recording the band wanted to pay tribute to the [[mixtape]] format, so they incorporated interludes.<ref>{{cite web|author=DanMichael |url=http://revive-music.com/2015/04/27/interview-nai-palm-discusses-choose-your-weapon/ |title=Interview: Nai Palm Discusses ''Choose Your Weapon''|publisher=Revive-music.com |date=27 April 2015 |access-date=19 June 2015}}</ref>
