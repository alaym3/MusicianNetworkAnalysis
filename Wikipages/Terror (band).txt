'''Terror''' is an American [[beatdown hardcore]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], formed in 2002. They have released seven studio albums and a number of other recordings.

==History==
Their debut album ''[[One with the Underdogs]]'' sold over 40,000 copies. They have toured throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and South America.<ref>[http://www.trustkill.com/artists/read-band-bio.php?id=10 Band bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230184622/http://www.trustkill.com/artists/read-band-bio.php?id=10 |date=December 30, 2008 }} Trustkill website</ref> Their sophomore album, ''[[Always the Hard Way]]'' reached No.&nbsp;10 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers and No.&nbsp;19 on the Top Independent Records chart.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=766621&model.vnuAlbumId=783875 Billboard Chart Info] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''</ref>

Before Terror, vocalist [[Scott Vogel]] sang for Slugfest, Despair, and for [[Buffalo, New York]]-based [[metalcore]] act [[Buried Alive (band)|Buried Alive]] in the mid-1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Julien|first=Alexandre|date=September 8, 2011|title=Structure Records Interview|url=http://www.abridgedpause.com/structurerecords|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423101746/http://www.abridgedpause.com/structurerecords|archive-date=February 23, 2017|access-date=September 12, 2020|website=Abridged Pause Blog|language=en-US}}</ref> Drummer Nick Jett and ex-guitarist Todd Jones were members of the well-known hardcore band Carry On (who had releases on Bridge Nine and Teamwork Records). Richmond, Virginia's David Wood is well known as the vocalist of his hometown hardcore band Down to Nothing. Carl Schwartz, formerly of [[Sworn Vengeance (band)|Sworn Vengeance]], recorded much of ''Always the Hard Way'' after quitting the band to front [[First Blood (band)|First Blood]] full-time.

Vogel is widely known in the scene not just for his efforts to keep hardcore "pure" and "fun", but for his love of stagedives, and for his tendency for on-stage banter, known colloquially as "Vogelisms". Examples include ''"We need to elevate the maximum stagedive potential"'', ''"Take this shit to the next level"'', and ''"Maximum output! Activate the pit!"''.  Terror also participated in the first two years of the [[Sounds of the Underground]] tour.

''[[Live by the Code]]'', originally due out in 2012, was pushed back to April 2013, released by [[Victory Records]] on CD and by Reaper Records on vinyl. It was the band's first time charting on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at No. 121, selling 3,177 copies in its first week.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} It was also No. 1 on the [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers chart]] and No. 28 on [[Independent Albums]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} A total of six music videos for tracks off of ''Live by the Code'' have been released: "Live by the Code", "The Most High", "I'm Only Stronger", "Hard Lessons", "Shot of Reality", and "Cold Truth".<ref name=lbtc>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoryrecords.com/news/1667/terror-live-by-the-code-music-video|title=Terror Live By The Code Music Video|website=Victoryrecords.com|access-date=September 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name=tmh>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/terror-the-most-high-exclusive-video-premiere/|title=Terror, 'The Most High' – Exclusive Video Premiere|website=Loudwire.com|access-date=September 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name=ios>{{Cite web|url=https://metalinjection.net/video/terror-im-only-stronger-video|title=TERROR I'm Only Stronger video|website=Metalinjection.net|access-date=September 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name=hl>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoryrecords.com/news/1836/terror-premiere-quothard-lessonsquot-|title=Terror Premiere "Hard Lessons"|website=Victoryrecords.com|access-date=September 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name=sor>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/aptv_video/terror_shot_of_reality_video_premiere/|title=Terror - "Shot Of Reality" video premiere|first=Matt|last=Crane|website=Altpress.com|date=July 8, 2014|access-date=September 27, 2020}}</ref><ref name=ct>{{Cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/terror-premiere-new-music-video-cold-truth.html|title=Terror Premiere New Music Video - "Cold Truth"|website=Revolvermag.com|access-date=September 27, 2020}}</ref>
