'''Charles Otto Puth Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|p|uː|θ}}; born December 2, 1991) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. His initial exposure came through the viral success of his song videos uploaded to [[YouTube]].

After initially signing with [[eleveneleven]] after performing on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', Puth began contributing to songs and albums for other artists, as well as creating lite solo material and covers of popular songs. With primary intent on a solo career, [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Artist Partner Group]] eventually sought the artist and released his debut single, "[[Marvin Gaye (song)|Marvin Gaye]]" (featuring [[Meghan Trainor]]), in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-charlie-puth-ott-0624-20160620-story.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-08-11 |archive-date=2019-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190811144503/https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-charlie-puth-ott-0624-20160620-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> His next single and first feature, "[[See You Again]]", which he co-wrote, co-produced, and performed with Atlantic label-mate [[Wiz Khalifa]] for the ''[[Furious 7]]'' soundtrack as a tribute to actor [[Paul Walker]].

==Personal life==
Growing up, Puth was bullied at school. He stated, "They would team up against me so bad and they would kick me in a place that wouldn't feel fantastic and I would need to throw up and they would then say I was pretending to throw up."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/charlie-puth-interview-being-bullied-for-pitch-perfect-talent-and-selena-gomezs-advice-on-dealing-a6841501.html|title=How Charlie Puth dealt with school bullies and the negative side of fame|date=2016-01-29|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-GB|archive-date=2021-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213034709/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/charlie-puth-interview-being-bullied-pitch-perfect-talent-and-selena-gomez-s-advice-dealing-negativity-a6841501.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

He has also disclosed on ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'' that he suffered a nervous breakdown. He stated: "[The nervous breakdown happened from] just being overworked and I'm in my head a lot and that, in combination with jet-lag and you know the self realization that I am getting more famous and my privacy goes out the window pretty much every day, it's just not what I'm used to and I don't think I'm ever going to be used to it and my therapy is to just put melody to it and sing it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://onairwithryan.iheart.com/featured/ryan-seacrest/content/2018-05-10-charlie-puth-reveals-most-personal-song-yet-came-from-a-nervous-breakdown/|title=Charlie Puth Suffered a Nervous Breakdown {{!}} Ryan Seacrest {{!}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest|work=Ryan Seacrest|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213034702/https://onairwithryan.iheart.com/featured/ryan-seacrest/content/2018-05-10-charlie-puth-reveals-most-personal-song-yet-came-from-a-nervous-breakdown/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Puth has said that [[Justin Bieber]]'s "viral leap into superstardom as a result of YouTube" influenced him to achieve the same.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B8jWTHKl2RY/|title=Charlie Puth on Instagram: "I don't usually do this but here we go. #Changes by Justin Bieber is out now.
