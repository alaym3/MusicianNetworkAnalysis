=== Democratic sexual harassment scandals ===
Members of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], both prominent and local, have been accused of participating in the war on women. In a column for ''[[USA Today]]'', [[Glenn Reynolds]] wrote in July 2013 that "most of the action in the war on women seems to be coming from the Democratic front," referring to the allegations of sexual harassment against [[San Diego]] mayor [[Bob Filner#Allegations of sexual harassment|Bob Filner]], the [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandal]], and the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal]].<ref>''USA Today'': [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/07/29/women-harassment-filner-weiner-sydney-leathers-column/2594213/ The latest in the war on women]. July 29, 2013.</ref> The [[Republican National Senatorial Committee]] has also used these scandals in press releases, tying Democratic Senators in [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]] to the allegations.<ref>NRSC Press Release: [http://www.iowagop.org/war-on-women-bruce-braley-silent-as-fellow-democrats-mistreat-women/ Republican Party of Iowa].</ref><ref>''NH Journal'': [http://nhjournal.com/2013/07/23/nrsc-dings-shaheen-over-war-on-women/ NRSC dings Shaheen over 'war on women'.] July 23, 2013.</ref>

The messaging from Republicans was described as unlikely to be effective by Garance Franke-Ruta in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' because "[the War on Women] was an argument about Republican policies on women ... rather than about reprehensible individual behavior." Noting that many of the targets are not on upcoming ballots, Franke-Ruta continued by saying the Republican Party "is going to need its own pro-active framework for thinking about what is happening in America and why women have been drawn to Democrats in numbers that matter in key elections."<ref name="Atlantic" />

Molly Redden wrote an article for ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' entitled "The War on Women is Over -- and Women Lost".
