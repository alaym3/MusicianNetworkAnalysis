==Career==
===Songwriting and producing===
Finneas has said his experience playing characters helped with writing music for his sister [[Billie Eilish]], as he writes from her perspective and for her vocal range.<ref name="Tatiana"/> He stated: "Being able to hear an artist and emulate them has been a huge part of being successful as a producer and co-writer".<ref name="Tatiana"/> When he writes for his sister, he wants to "write a song that I think she'll relate to and enjoy singing and empathise with the lyrics and make her own", and when he writes with her he tries to "help her tell whatever story she's trying to tell, bounce ideas off of her, listen to her ideas."<ref name="Atwood">{{cite magazine|url=http://atwoodmagazine.com/finneas-2018-interview/|title=Wholehearted Obsession: A Conversation with FINNEAS|magazine=[[Atwood Magazine]]|date=April 27, 2018|access-date=February 18, 2019|first=Nicole|last=Almeida|archive-date=April 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200414111828/https://atwoodmagazine.com/finneas-2018-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref> {{blockquote|Similarly to other artists, if you're writing and you know that someone else's voice is going to be the voice telling the story, it should be a language that fits them. ... Everybody has a different vocabulary, a different way of putting sentences together, and the easiest way to tell if a song wasn't written by someone is if it doesn't fit their vernacular, so I try to match whatever I'm helping them make to whoever they seem to be. A lot of that also ... is asking an artist how they feel about it. If you come up with a line, even if an artist really likes it and is like 'That's a really cool line,' it's like 'Yeah, but can you wear it? Is it a thing you’d feel comfortable with singing every time?'<ref name="Atwood"/>|author=|title=|source=}}
