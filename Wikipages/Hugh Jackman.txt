After obtaining his BA, Jackman completed the one-year course "The Journey" at the [[Actors Centre Australia|Actors' Centre]] in Sydney.<ref name="bravo"/> About studying acting full-time, he stated, "It wasn't until I was 22 that I ever thought about my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always had an interest in theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that.

Jackman has said he "always loved acting but when I started at drama school I was like the dunce of the class. It just wasn't coming right to me. Everyone was cooler, everyone seemed more likely to succeed, everyone seemed more natural at it and in retrospect, I think that is good. I think it is good to come from behind as an actor. I think it is good to go into an audition thinking, 'Man I've got to be at my best to get this gig.'"<ref name="shavemagazine">{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/interview-Hugh-Jackman/2 |title=Interview: Hugh Jackman |work=[[Shave (magazine)|Shave Magazine]] |first=Ziyah |last=Karmali |access-date=8 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311185759/http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/interview-Hugh-Jackman/2 |archive-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
===1995–1999: Early career in theatre===
On the night of his final Academy graduation performance, Jackman received a phone call offering him a role on ''[[Correlli]]'': "I was technically unemployed for thirteen seconds." ''Correlli'', devised by Australian actress [[Denise Roberts]], was a 10-part drama series on ABC, Jackman's first major professional job, and where he met his future wife [[Deborra-Lee Furness]]. "Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it," he said,<ref name="Biography Today 2010, p. 87"/> as the show lasted only one season. After ''Correlli'' Jackman went on the stage in Melbourne. In 1996, Jackman played [[Gaston (Beauty and the Beast)|Gaston]] in the local Walt Disney production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and Joe Gillis in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.<ref name="bravo"/> During his stage musical career in Melbourne, he starred in the 1998 [[Midsumma]] festival cabaret production ''[[Summa Cabaret]]''. He also hosted Melbourne's [[Carols by Candlelight]] and Sydney's [[The Domain, Sydney|Carols in the Domain]]. Jackman's early film works include ''[[Erskineville Kings]]'' and ''[[Paperback Hero (1999 film)|Paperback Hero]]'' (1999), and his television work includes ''[[Law of the Land]]'', ''[[Halifax f.p.]]'', ''[[Blue Heelers]]'', and ''[[The Man from Snowy River (TV series)|Banjo Paterson's The Man from Snowy River]]''.

Jackman became known outside Australia in 1998, when he played the leading role of Curly in the [[Royal National Theatre]]'s acclaimed stage production of ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].<ref name="bravo"/> The performance earned him an [[Olivier Award]] nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Jackman said, "I totally felt like it can't get any better than this. On some level that production will be one of the highlights of my career."<ref>Biography Today (2010), p. 89</ref> He also starred in the [[Oklahoma! (1999 film)|1999 film version of the same stage musical]], which has been screened in many countries.

===2000–2004: Breakthrough with ''X-Men''===
Jackman had his breakthrough role playing [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in [[Bryan Singer]]'s ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000)—a superhero film based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men|team of the same name]].<ref name="career">{{cite news|last1=Sacks|first1=Ethan|title=Hugh Jackman: Wolverine will 'exist way longer than me'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/hugh-jackman-wolverine-exist-longer-article-1.1409140|access-date=27 March 2017|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=26 July 2013|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328105204/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/hugh-jackman-wolverine-exist-longer-article-1.1409140|archive-date=28 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Co-starring [[Patrick Stewart]], [[James Marsden]], [[Famke Janssen]] and [[Ian McKellen]], the film tells the story of a group of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], whose [[superpower (ability)|superhuman powers]] make them distrusted by normal humans.

Wolverine was tough for Jackman to portray because he had few lines, but much emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched [[Clint Eastwood]] in the [[Dirty Harry (film series)|''Dirty Harry'' movies]] and [[Mel Gibson]] in ''[[Mad Max 2]]''. "There were guys who had relatively little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it."<ref>Biography Today (2010), pp. 90-91</ref> Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of [[Mike Tyson]] fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty."<ref>Biography Today (2010), p. 91</ref> Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. He said, "Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned."<ref name="Biography Today"/>
