'''Flor''' (stylized as '''flor''') (previously '''Sunderland''') is an American indie band formed in [[Hood River, Oregon]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/flor-mn0003577781/biography|title=Flor {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref> The band currently consists of Zach Grace (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), McKinley Kitts (guitar), Dylan Bauld (bass), and Kyle Hill (drums).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fueledbyramen.com/artist/flor|title=FLOR {{!}} Fueled By Ramen|website=Fueled By Ramen Official Website|language=en|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref>

==History==
The band got its start in Hood River, Oregon, when Zach Grace began experimenting with electronic music-making programs to create ear-catching synth sounds. Bauld built tracks around these snippets, turning them into songs that updated the sound of the '80s for the 21st century. After moving to Los Angeles, Flor connected with photographer/designer Jade Ehlers, who helped the band come up with distinctive visuals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/flor-mn0003577781/biography|title=Flor {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> Meanwhile, Bauld established himself as a producer working with Flor, as well as artists like [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Lights (musician)|Lights]], [[Smallpools]], and Lostboycrow. The band released their debut single, "heart", online in 2014, with the ''Sounds'' EP arriving that October. Following the release of the 2015 full-length ''Sights & Sounds'', Flor signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]] in 2016, which reissued the ''Sounds'' EP that February.

Flor's debut album, ''come out. you’re hiding'' was released on May 19, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/0szWPxzzE8DVEfXFRCLBUb|title=flor|website=Spotify|language=en|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref> The album title was teased in a tweet on March 23 before being confirmed in another tweet the next day. The album’s lead single, "guarded", was released the same day. Following this, the band released the official tracklist through two tweets.

On March 8, 2019, Flor released the new single "slow motion". On July 10 they announced their second studio album, ''ley lines''. It came out on September 6, 2019 and includes twelve songs. When asked about the inspiration behind the album, lead singer Grace said, "There's a theory that important places of power like Stonehenge or the Pyramids of Giza are connected by invisible lines. As a parallel, I needed to find my own anchor points for belief and purpose. I realized you can build those roads yourself. Friends, family, and the band are my anchors. The music comes out of the 'ley lines'".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/albums/Flor/Ley-lines|title=ley lines by flor|website=Genius|language=en|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref>

On November 11, 2019, Flor announced their first North American tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B4urpQbjzaz/|title=@flor on Instagram: "back on the road this winter to headline in all these new cities we also get to take our dear friends @winnetkabowlingleague with us …"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=February 7, 2020}}</ref>
