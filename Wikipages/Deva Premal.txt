== Biography ==

Premal met her partner in life and music, [[Andy Desmond|Miten]], at the Osho International Meditation Resort in [[Pune]], India in 1990, where she was studying reflexology, shiatsu, cranio-sacral therapy, and massage.<ref name="Brachfeld">{{cite news|last=Brachfeld|first=Aaron|title=An Interview with Deva Primel|url=http://meadowlarkherald.blogspot.com/2013/05/an-interview-with-deva-primel.html|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=the Meadowlark Herald|date=2 June 2013}}</ref> They have been touring together since 1992, offering concerts and chant workshops worldwide.<ref>Dubrovsky, Anna.

Best known for her top-selling chant CDs,<ref>Widran, Jonathan. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/dakshina-r733905 ''Review: Dakshina''] ''AllMusic''.</ref> Premal is a classically trained musician who grew up singing mantras in a German home permeated with Eastern spirituality. Her albums have topped New Age charts throughout the world since her first release, ''The Essence'' (1998), which features the "Gayatri Mantra." Premal and Miten's record company, Prabhu Music, reports sales of over 900,000 albums.

Premal says she began her journey with mantra in her mother's womb, as her father chanted the "Gayatri Mantra"—one of the most sacred mantras of [[Sanatana dharma|Sanatana Dharma]]—to her daily.  The mantra continued to be her bedtime lullaby after she was born. Many years later, she heard a friend singing the Gayatri and was inspired to put together an album. Premal and Miten recorded ''The Essence'' (1998) in her mother's apartment in Germany, where she was born and where she first heard the Gayatri Mantra.<ref name="ABC">Spirit of Things. [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/spiritofthings/stories/2008/2160547.htm ''Mantras Go Mainstream''], ''Interview with Rachel Kohn on ABC Radio'', Feb 2008.</ref>

Premal brought this journey with the [[Gayatri Mantra]] full circle in July 2005, when she and Miten chanted it for her father as he was dying; "We kept singing for what must have been over half an hour, when suddenly the monitor showed that he was about to leave. I continued to sing, and the last sound he heard as he passed on was his beloved "Gayatri Mantra." Finally we ended with the mantra Om and the circle was complete. He had welcomed me onto this planet with the "Gayatri," and I accompanied him out of this physical existence with it. What a blessing this was for me! It was the first time that I was present at a death, and to be at my father's is a memory I will cherish all my life."<ref>Deva Premal.

“The meaning is secondary. The word table is not the table...with Sanskrit, the word ananda is the sound vibration of bliss. In sound the energy of bliss. We have to say bliss; we have to make it smaller by putting it into an English word. Just the sound; ananda, If we were sensitive enough, we'd just feel the entire scope of that energy that's contained in this sound... It's working on a cellular level. It's much deeper than the mind. It's not a language that you need to understand the meaning of before you use it. It's a deep universal sound code that connects us all.”

Premal's chants have been used in a variety of settings. [[Cher]] featured Premal's version of the "Gayatri Mantra" on her Farewell Tour<ref>Tsering, Lisa.

Premal and Miten performed for [[The Dalai Lama]] during a 2002 Conference in Munich, [[Germany]] on "Unity in Duality," which brought top figures from the scientific community together with members of the Buddhist community.<ref>Tarab Institute.

Premal's ''Tibetan Mantras for Precarious Times'' (2010) was recorded with the Gyuto Monks of Tibet, known for their tradition of overtone singing, also described as "chordal chanting". It was created as a support for mantra meditation practice, featuring eight mantras chanted 108 times each. It is a benefit CD, with proceeds going to the [[Gyuto Order|Gyuto Monastery]] in [[Dharmsala]], [[India]], the Phowa Project, and Veggiyana.

== Music & information ==

Premal and Miten say they use a process of "natural selection" to choose the mantras on their albums.  Premal has said she gravitates toward Sanskrit mantras, rather than mantras from other languages.  She says that, for her, removing her ego from her understanding of the mantra allows the creative process to express the true meaning of the mantra.<ref name="Brachfeld"/>

She explains that the purpose of their work "is to be open to the Goddess of music – to be true to ourselves, as musicians, as 'teachers;' as partners, and ultimately, as individuals – fellow travellers.  We accomplish this by not 'trying' to accomplish anything. We take very little credit for what is happening around our so-called success (we have sold over a million albums now) – we see ourselves as messengers of a 5,000-year-old tradition...so, our part in the process is simply to show up and chant."<ref name="Brachfeld"/>
Her vocal range is [[contralto]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
