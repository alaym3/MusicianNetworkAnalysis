== Musical styles ==
According to [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]], Keed's style is frequently compared to Young Thug, as the two rappers both grew on Cleveland Avenue and Keed is signed to YSL Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/02/lil-keed-interview-the-break/|title=The Break Presents: Lil Keed - XXL|last=Seabrook|first=Robby III|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=October 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Chicago Reader]] described Keed's style as similar to Young Thug's while incorporating his own distinct flow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/lil-keed-brings-new-dimensions-to-atlantas-syllable-blurring-hip-hop/Content?oid=73237636|title=Lil Keed brings new dimensions to Atlanta's syllable-blurring hip-hop|last=Galil|first=Leor|website=Chicago Reader|date=September 13, 2019|language=en|access-date=October 6, 2019}}</ref>
