==History==

===1973–79: Formation and early releases===
Vocalist and guitarist [[David Hidalgo]] and drummer [[Louie Pérez]] met at [[Garfield High School (Los Angeles County, California)|Garfield High School]] in [[East Los Angeles, California]], and bonded over their mutual affinity for musical acts such as [[Fairport Convention]], [[Randy Newman]] and [[Ry Cooder]].<ref name="Interviewlouis">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-11-15/entertainment/chi-los-lobos-interview-louis-perez-on-songwriting-20111115_1_perez-and-hidalgo-cesar-rosas-los-lobos|title=Los Lobos interview; Louis Perez on songwriting|last=Kot|first=Greg|work=The Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|date=November 15, 2011|access-date=April 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Oldhaunts">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-11/news/ti-2696_1_los-lobos|title=Los Lobos Returns to Old Haunts on New LP|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|date=October 11, 1990|access-date=April 1, 2012|work=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company}}</ref> Pérez recalls, "We’re looking at each other, 'You like this stuff? I thought I was the only weird one.' So I went over to his house one day for about a year, which we spent listening to records, playing guitars, and starting to write songs."<ref name="Interviewlouis"/> The two borrowed [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel recorders]] from a friend and created multitrack recordings of music spanning from [[Parody music|parody songs]] to [[Free jazz|free-form jazz]].<ref name="Interviewlouis"/> They later enlisted fellow students [[Frank Gonzalez]], [[Cesar Rosas]] and [[Conrad Lozano]] to complete the group's lineup, in 1973.<ref name="Oldhaunts"/> Their first album, ''[[Los Lobos del Este de Los Angeles]]'', was recorded at two studios in Hollywood in 1977 over a period of about four months. At that time, they all had regular jobs, and it was hard to get together for the sessions. To accommodate that situation, their producer Louis Torres would call the engineer, Mark Fleisher, who owned and operated a high-speed tape duplicating studio in Hollywood, to find a studio when he knew all the band members could get off work that night. Most of the songs were recorded at a studio on Melrose Avenue, located next to the Paramount studios at the time, and a low-priced studio on Sunset Boulevard.

The band members were unsatisfied with playing only American Top 40 songs and began experimenting with the traditional Mexican music they listened to as children.<ref name="Oldhaunts"/> This style of music received a positive reaction from audiences, leading the band to switch genres, performing at hundreds of weddings and dances between 1974 and 1980.<ref name="Oldhaunts"/> However, Los Lobos took notice of the popular groups on the Hollywood music scene and added influences of rock to its sound.<ref name="Oldhaunts"/>

Originally, they called themselves Los Lobos del Este (de Los Angeles) ("The Wolves of the East [of Los Angeles)]"), which was a play on the name of the [[norteño music|norteño]] band [[Los Tigres del Norte]]; also, there was another conjunto band at the time named "Los Lobos Del Norte", who had released several albums already, and in fact Los Lobos del Este were from east L.A. The name was quickly shortened to Los Lobos.<ref>El Cancionero: Mas y Mas liner notes of CD box set.</ref>

===1980–88: ''How Will the Wolf Survive?'' and commercial success===
The band's first noteworthy public appearance occurred in 1980 at the [[Olympic Auditorium]] in [[Los Angeles]], when they were hired by [[David Ferguson (impresario)|David Ferguson]] and CD Presents to open for [[Public Image Ltd.]] In 1983, the band released an [[extended play]] entitled ''[[...And a Time to Dance]]'', which was well received by critics but sold only about 50,000 copies.<ref name="Wolfrolling">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/los-lobos-how-will-the-wolf-survive-19691231|title=100 Best Albums of the Eighties - Los Lobos: How Will the Wolf Survive?|work=Rolling Stone|date=November 16, 1989|publisher=Jann Wenner|access-date=April 1, 2012}}</ref> However, the sales of the EP earned the group enough money to purchase a [[Dodge]] van, enabling the band to tour throughout the United States for the first time.<ref name="Wolfrolling"/> Los Lobos returned to the studio in the summer of 1984 to record its first major-label album, ''[[How Will the Wolf Survive?]]''<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/los-lobos-p99039/biography|title=Los Lobos - Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=April 1, 2012}}</ref> The album's title and the title song were inspired by a ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' article entitled "Where Can the Wolf Survive," which the band members related to their own struggle to gain success in the United States while maintaining their Mexican roots.<ref name="Wolfrolling"/>

Los Lobos were exposed to Rock and Roll audiences when they opened for [[The Clash]], a punk/new wave group, and they later opened for a Los Angeles band [[the Blasters]], with influences in rhythm and blues and rockabilly.<ref name="Lipsitz">{{Cite journal|last=Lipsitz|first=George|date=1986|title=Cruising around the Historical Bloc: Postmodernism and Popular Music in East Los Angeles|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1354360|journal=Cultural Critique|issue=5|pages=157–177|doi=10.2307/1354360|jstor=1354360|issn=0882-4371}}</ref> Steve Berlin, who was born in Philadelphia, was a saxophone player for the Blasters and then left the group to join Los Lobos. When he joined the group, Berlin spoke about his similar record collection to the other members of Los Lobos, where they shared loves for [[George Jones]] and [[Hank Williams]].<ref name="Lipsitz" />

The film ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'' includes "One Time, One Night" in the opening credits, although the song was not included on the soundtrack album. In 1986, members of Los Lobos appeared alongside [[Tomata du Plenty]] in the punk rock musical ''[[Population: 1]]''. In 1987, they released a second album, ''[[By the Light of the Moon (album)|By the Light of the Moon]]''. In the same year, they recorded some [[Ritchie Valens]] covers for the soundtrack of the film ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]'', including the [[La Bamba (song)|title track]], which became a number one single for the band. In 1988, they followed with another album, ''[[La pistola y el corazón]]'', featuring original and traditional Mexican songs.  Also in 1988 they contributed their cover of "[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)]]", to the Disney tribute album ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films]]''.

===1988–94: ''The Neighborhood'' and ''Kiko''===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s the band toured extensively throughout the world, opening for such acts as [[Bob Dylan]], [[U2]] and the [[Grateful Dead]].

Los Lobos returned with ''[[The Neighborhood (album)|The Neighborhood]]'' in 1990, and the more experimental ''[[Kiko (album)|Kiko]]'' (produced by [[Mitchell Froom]]) in 1992.  In 1991, the band contributed a lively cover of "Bertha", a song which they often performed live, to the Grateful Dead tribute–rain forest benefit album ''[[Deadicated]].''  In 1994 they also contributed a track, "Down Where the Drunkards Roll", to the [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] tribute album ''Beat the Retreat''.

On the band's twentieth anniversary they released a two-CD collection of singles, outtakes, live recordings and hits, entitled ''Just Another Band from East L.A.''

===1995–98: ''Papa's Dream'' and ''Colossal Head''===
In 1995, Los Lobos released the prestigious and bestselling record ''[[Papa's Dream]]'' on [[Music for Little People Records]] along with veteran guitarist and singer [[Lalo Guerrero]]. The band also scored the film ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]''.  The album track "Mariachi Suite" won a [[Grammy]] Award for [[Best Pop Instrumental Performance]] and stands as their last Grammy Award to date (the other two Grammy Awards were in the category of [[Best Mexican-American Performance]] in 1983 and 1989 for the song "Anselma" and the album ''La Pistola y el Corazón'').

In 1996, they released ''Colossal Head''. In spite of the fact that the album was critically acclaimed, [[Warner Brothers]] decided to drop the band from their roster. Los Lobos spent the next few years on side projects. The band contributed along with [[Money Mark]] to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]], on which they performed "Pepe and Irene."

===1999–2006: Mammoth Records, subsequent releases===
