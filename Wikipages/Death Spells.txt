'''Death Spells''' was an American [[digital hardcore]] band formed in 2012. The group was composed of [[My Chemical Romance]] rhythm guitarist [[Frank Iero]] and keyboardist [[James Dewees]] (also of [[The Get Up Kids]] and [[Reggie and the Full Effect]]), who were both members of [[hardcore punk]] band [[Leathermouth]] as well.

==History==
Frank Iero and James Dewees were sharing an apartment in North Hollywood, Los Angeles in 2012 while My Chemical Romance was writing and recording in studio.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The project originally came to fruition when Iero and Dewees snuck equipment out of the studio so they could mess around with it and were "trying to blow up each other's speakers."{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The seediness of the area they were located in was a huge influence to the music, with the pair aiming to get "as grimly as humanely possible" without getting kicked out of the apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In 2013, after My Chemical Romance disbanded, Death Spells started touring. This included a support slot on [[Mindless Self Indulgence]]'s East Coast US tour as well as playing Skate And Surf festival.<ref>{{cite web| last = Pettigrew| first = Jason| title = Mega-Death: Frank Iero and James Dewees conjure Death Spells| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = April 10, 2013| url = http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/mega_death_frank_iero_and_james_dewees_conjure_death_spells| accessdate = November 22, 2013}}</ref> Starting a week before the Mindless Self Indulgence tour, Death Spells posted a short demo of a new song each night at midnight, culminating this with their first full single "Where Are My Fucking Pills?" and an accompanying music video.<ref>{{cite web| last = Whitt| first = Cassie| title = Death Spells (Frank Iero and James Dewees) release video for 'Where Are My Fucking Pills?'| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = April 8, 2013| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/death_spells_frank_iero_and_james_dewees_release_video_for_where_are_my_fuc| accessdate = November 22, 2013}}</ref> A full-length album was expected to be released in late 2013,<ref>{{cite web| last = Whitt| first = Cassie| title = 'The plan is to have a Death Spells release out this year' – Frank Iero on post-My Chem projects| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = June 3, 2013| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_plan_is_to_have_a_death_spells_release_out_this_year_frank_iero_on_post| accessdate = November 22, 2013}}</ref> however this never happened due to them moving onto other projects. The band supported [[Architects (American band)|The Architects]] in three shows in late 2013 and released a limited cassette release available at those shows.

Death Spells released their debut studio album "Nothing Above, Nothing Below" on July 29, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/frank_iero_and_james_dewees_bring_catharsis_with_death_spells_debut_lp/|title=Frank Iero and James Dewees bring catharsis with Death Spells' debut LP|first=Jason|last=Pettigrew|date=June 26, 2016|accessdate=July 14, 2021}}</ref> Following the release of the album, Iero and Dewees went on a small headlining tour with four dates in the UK, one date in Moscow, and two dates in the United States.

It was announced that they played be played two shows with Iero's solo project, frnkiero and the patience, on the days immediately before and after their Riot Fest Chicago performances.
