'''''Horrible Histories''''' is an [[educational entertainment]] franchise encompassing many media including books, magazines, audio books, stage shows, TV shows, and more.

In 2013, Lisa Edwards, UK publishing and commercial director of [[Scholastic Corporation]], described ''Horrible Histories'' as one of the company's "crown jewels", and said it is at an "advanced stage of evolution". She added: "We have covered every possible era that has a commercial outcome...We're now in the era of the box set, annuals, newly presented editions and licensed products".<ref>{{cite web|author=TV and Radio |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9857326/Horrible-Histories-20-years-of-entertaining-children.html |title=Horrible Histories: 20 years of entertaining children |publisher=Telegraph |access-date=2013-12-26}}</ref>

===Main series===

{{Main|Horrible Histories (book series)}}

''Horrible Histories'' began as a book series by author [[Terry Deary]].<ref>Jerome de Groot ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular ... '' 2008 p. 39 "''Horrible Histories'' are designed to engage and enthuse the reader about the subject while appearing subversive.30 The books are primarily entertainment, with educative purpose. They are ancillary to school history, offering an iconoclastic ..."</ref> The series began in 1993 with ''The Terrible Tudors'' and ''The Awful Egyptians'', and the following titles continued the trend to describe British history through the context of the ruling dynasties, as well as explore significant worldwide cultures (often within the context of British history such as the Viking and Roman conquests on the British Isles). A series of specials and novelty books have been released, and the last book was announced to be released in 2013.

Each issue came with small cards depicting historic people, places, events and customs as well as a collection of timelines. The first 60 issues came with timelines each showing an era of human history, while the later 20 had timelines showing the history of themes such as fashion, art and science. Some of the first 60 issues also had a royal family tree based on a certain period of history. The only exception of for Savage Stone Age, which instead had a comparison of all the ancient forms of man and what they ate.

There have also been three "special" magazines in the series:

* S1. Horrible Christmas
* S2. Cruel Crimes and Painful Punishments
* S3. Cruel Kings and Mean Queens – ([[English monarchs family tree|English Monarchs]])

The collection would not be relaunched in the UK in September 2009 due to low trial sales.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.terry-deary.net/adventure/diary.htm "Deary Diary"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423155924/http://www.terry-deary.net/adventure/diary.htm |date=2012-04-23 }}, House of Adventure, URL retrieved 7 April 2008</ref>

===2012 series===
A monthly ''Horrible Histories'' magazine aimed at ages 7 to 10 was launched in the UK in October 2012, published by [[Immediate Media Company]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PI38AgAAQBAJ&q=horrible+histories&pg=PA270 |title=Inside Magazine Publishing - Google Books |date= 2014-03-05|access-date=2014-04-17|isbn=9781317817130 |last1=Stam |first1=David |last2=Scott |first2=Andrew }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/horrible-histories-launch-childrens-magazine |title=Horrible Histories to launch children's magazine |publisher=Press Gazette |access-date=2013-12-26}}</ref> A digital edition of the magazine was launched in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dredge |first=Stuart |url=http://appsplayground.com/2013/09/26/horrible-histories-magazine-comes-iphone-ipad/ |title=Horrible Histories Magazine comes to iPhone and iPad |publisher=Appsplayground.com |date=2013-09-26 |access-date=2013-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227005625/http://appsplayground.com/2013/09/26/horrible-histories-magazine-comes-iphone-ipad/ |archive-date=2013-12-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Illustrations==

Across the franchise, ''Horrible Histories'' is recognisable by the illustrations of Martin Brown, an [[Australia]]n cartoonist/illustrator.<ref name="www5.scholastic">{{cite web|url=http://www5.scholastic.co.uk/zone/authors_m-brown_biog.htm|title=Author Zone: Martin Brown|work=Scholastic Children's Books|access-date=2009-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418181811/http://www.scholastic.co.uk/zone/authors_m-brown_biog.htm|archive-date=2009-04-18|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="telegraph">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bath-childrens-literature/8796167/Martin-Brown-theres-an-art-to-having-fun.html|title=Martin Brown: there's an art to having fun|date=29 September 2011|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=18 October 2014}}</ref>

Regardless of what type of illustration is required, Brown's first step is to read the accompanying text. With Horrible Histories colleague Terry Deary, his task as a cartoonist is to inject humour into the books, so he then bounced ideas back and forth, "either coming up with gags to suit the text or interpreting Terry's instructions for best comic or dramatic effect". The third stage is working out how "angles, scale, aspect, style, pace etc" will be considered in the design space. After that he draws the roughs and finally the finished drawing. The roughs are first sent to the publishers who make their comments, and then they are sent to Deary. Tweaks are done in the rough stage. In the case of full colours books, the last stage is adding colour; either he does it via ink and water-colour, or "the line-work is scanned and sent to a colourist who adds the colour on computer".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/english-association/sigs/childrens-literature/authors/martin-brown|title=Children's Literature Interest Group: Interview with Martin Brown|publisher=Le.ac.uk|access-date=18 October 2014}}</ref>

===Reception===
The response has been generally positive:<blockquote>Terry Deary and Martin Brown's brilliant books about the nastiest periods in history have now—with the help of some astounding actors—been transformed into a series of audio extravaganzas. Featuring new, extra material not found anywhere in the books, these sound spectaculars are just as thrilling and spilling, funny and fast as their printed counterparts. ''Horrible Histories'' are guaranteed to bring you history with the nasty bits left in! The Rotten Romans features beastly battles, deadly doctoring and marvellous myths—and you can even find out how to tell the future using a dead chicken! It's packed with quizzes, sketches, music and jokes, as well as mini-dramas and real life re-enactments—telling you the kind of foul facts which just aren't available from a classroom education!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terry-deary.com/pg/media---terry-deary |title=Media |publisher=Terry Deary |access-date=2011-12-12}}</ref></blockquote>

===Virtual world===
{{Main|Horrible Histories World}}

Scholastic went into partnership with agency Yomego to create an online world using the HuzuVirtual [[virtual world framework]] from software company HuzuTech. Visitors to the virtual world will be able to create an avatar dressed in historical costume, explore, look in a virtual world shop, chat, and subscribe to events where the children may meet the author, Terry Deary. The idea is that users will be able to explore areas with names like "Rotten Rome", "Awesome Egypt", and "Terrible Tudor London".

==''Horrible Histories Interactive''==
''Horrible Histories Interactive'' is an online experience for children, available via the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] website or by the Red Button platform. The content, which was designed and developed by [[Red Bee Media]], was commissioned by ''Horrible Histories''<ref name="liontv_a"/> to work in tandem with the 2009 CBBC TV series. The online experience includes 12 exclusive Behind the Scenes clips, sing-along versions of the show's songs,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/games/by/show/horrible-histories |title=CBBC - Games: Horrible Histories |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |access-date=2013-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212232813/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/games/by/show/horrible-histories |archive-date=2013-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the online gaming experiences: Terrible Treasures, Time Sewer Adventures, and AD/BC Time Tour.

The aim of the multi-platform promotion was to shift perceptions about the series and to increase online participation. A beauty spoof campaign was devised, promos were run on BBC, countdown web banners were created, and an interactive promo for the site ran during the trailers for ahead of Shrek Forever. An interactive spoof talent show campaign was also launched, in which various historical characters vied for the title "Horrible Hero". Horrible Histories Interactive's work led to an increase of unique users to the ''Horrible Histories'' microsite,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redbeemedia.com/work/horrible-histories-cbbc-yourself |title=Horrible Histories - CBBC Yourself &#124; Work |publisher=Red Bee Media |access-date=2013-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227004429/http://www.redbeemedia.com/work/horrible-histories-cbbc-yourself |archive-date=2013-12-27 }}</ref> and an increase in the percentage of people who associated Horrible Histories with the CBBC.<ref name="redbeemedia1">{{cite web |url=http://www.redbeemedia.com/work/horrible-histories-horrible-hero |title=Horrible Histories - Horrible Hero &#124; Work |publisher=Red Bee Media |access-date=2013-12-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227004442/http://www.redbeemedia.com/work/horrible-histories-horrible-hero |archive-date=2013-12-27 }}</ref>

It takes advantage of Stage3D in an appealing and engaging live music stage environment. What is amazing though is the combination of actually really fun music with an increasing level of difficulty, and simple, but fun action."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.overdigital.com/2012/04/05/horrible-histories-adbc-time-tour-and-stage3d/ |title=Horrible Histories: AD/BC Time Tour and Stage3D |publisher=Overdigital.com |access-date=2013-12-26}}</ref>

==Theme park==
Author Terry Deary stated in March 2003 that he had plans for a £130 million theme park "...on an enormous scale, something that will really put this region on the map the way Disney World has done for Florida." Terry Deary's History Experience was to be built on South Tyneside, close to where Deary was born.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2880163.stm |title=UK &#124; England &#124; Author's plan for 'Horrible' theme park |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-03-24 |access-date=2011-12-12}}</ref> These original plans fell through, but new talks are underway about a second proposal, based in County Durham, which would include the Horrible Histories name.<ref>{{cite web|author=Published on Friday 22 August 2008 11:01 |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/39Horrible39-theme-park-for-County.4418316.jp |title='Horrible' theme park for County Durham - Local |publisher=Sunderland Echo |date=2008-08-22 |access-date=2011-12-12}}</ref>

Terry Deary said of ''The Terry Deary History Experience Park'': "What I hope to build is a History Experience where I recreate authentic villages from various periods — Tudor, Roman, Victorian perhaps — with nothing of the 20th century in them...They'll be enclosed in domes like the [[Eden Project]] in Cornwall so they'll be all-weather attractions and they will not be museums or theme parks; they will be peopled by actors and the visitors can join in the never-ending re-enactments of the past — with all its horrible history flavour — over there is a pickpocket on trial for stealing ... is he guilty, do we hang him? ''You'', the visitor, must decide." He wanted the audience to be fully immersed into the culture of the period, "Over there is Mr Shakespeare rehearsing a play and having trouble with the Puritans ... over here are the preparations for Queen Elizabeth's visit...in that house is a craftsman turning wooden bowls, and in that one a woman selling roast thrushes to take away while there is a house being built using genuine tools and skills and over there a Tudor ship. (When the ship is completed it will sail on the river and a new one built — when we have two we'll have a sea battle!)".<ref name="HHexhibitions">{{cite web | url=http://www.terry-deary.com/pg/exhibitions---terry-deary | title=Exhibitions — Terry Deary | publisher=Terry Deary Limited | work=Terry Deary: Best Selling Author & Television Personality | year=2010 | access-date=July 10, 2011}}</ref> The proposed park, to be set up in South Tyneside, was a £130m project. "The original plans included an all-weather attraction where recreated villages from the Roman times to Tudor and Victorian England were to be encased in domes similar to the Eden Project in Cornwall."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metametamedieval.com/2008/11/04/news-horrible-histories-attraction-planned-for-county-durham-uk/ |title=NEWS: Horrible Histories attraction planned for County Durham, UK |publisher=meta-meta-medieval |date=2008-11-04 |access-date=2014-04-17}}</ref>

In 2016, a ''Horrible Histories'' maze opened at Warwick Castle. It is an interactive hedge maze featuring zones based on various historical time periods. Activity at Warwick Castle also included interactive exhibitions and a bespoke theater production ‘Wicked Warwick’.
