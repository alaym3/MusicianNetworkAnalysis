'''Crystal Castles''' was a Canadian [[electronic music]] group formed in 2006 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, formed by songwriter-producer [[Ethan Kath]] and singer-songwriter [[Alice Glass]], who later left and was replaced by Edith Frances. Crystal Castles were known for their chaotic live shows and [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] melancholic homemade productions. They released many limited vinyl singles between 2006 and 2007 before releasing four studio albums between 2008 and 2016.

Glass announced her departure from the band in October 2014, citing personal and professional reasons.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eakin|first1=Marah|title=Crystal Castles Call It Quits | url=https://www.avclub.com/article/crystal-castles-call-it-quits-210239 |newspaper=[[The A.V.

==History==
===2006–2007: Formation and ''Alice Practice''===
Ethan Kath (born Claudio Palmieri) met Alice Glass (born Margaret Osborn) in Toronto, Ontario while doing community service at the center for the blind.<ref name = "Billboard">[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045903/crystal-castles "Crystal Castles"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. [[Prometheus Global Media]]. April 9, 2008. Retrieved August 7, 2017.</ref><ref name="Complex" /> He asked her to record vocals over tracks he had been working on since 2003. The sessions resulted in the track "[[Alice Practice]]", which was shelved for six months.<ref name="The Times"/>{{Dead link|date=April 2017 |fix-attempted=yes}}

After being posted online, this track garnered attention and the duo decided to re-form for a formal release.<ref name="Fader" />  The pair picked their stage names together, with the name 'Crystal Castles' pulled from a line in the cartoon ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'': "The fate of the world is safe in Crystal Castles."<ref>{{cite web|title=Crystal Castles Interview, mp3s, secret show!|url=http://sparksvsspace.blogspot.com/2007/06/3-newer-cc-remixes.html|website=sparks vs space|access-date=April 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516185801/http://sparksvsspace.blogspot.com/2007/06/3-newer-cc-remixes.html|archive-date=May 16, 2008|date=June 12, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Youtube" />

''Alice Practice'' became the band's first limited vinyl release in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.planbmag.com/content/view/492/42/|title=Crystal Castles Interview – Plan B Magazine|last=Gillen|first=Kieron|date=January 3, 2008|website=plan B magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103053445/http://www.planbmag.com/content/view/492/42/|archive-date=January 3, 2008 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Brandes|first1=Bertie|title=crystal castles' leading lady alice glass is embracing her own darkness | url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/crystal-castles-leading-lady-alice-glass-is-embracing-her-own-darkness|publisher=[[ID-Vice]] |date=February 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Mcnett|first1=Jared|title=Five songs to listen to now that Crystal Castles appear to be done | url=http://www.voxmagazine.com/2014/10/five-songs-to-listen-to-now-that-crystal-castles-appear-to-be-done/|work=[[Vox Magazine]] |date=October 8, 2014}}</ref> After miming the song on the British television series ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'', demand for the ''Alice Practice'' EP grew rapidly.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/forkcast/40769 |title="Air War"/ "Lovers Who Uncover (Little Ones Remix)" [MP3s&#93; |website= PitchforkMedia.com |access-date= 2007-04-08 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070505230035/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/forkcast/40769#Crystal_Castles_Rising_Crystal_Castles_ |archive-date= 2007-05-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several limited-edition 7-inch vinyl singles followed in 2006 and 2007 on various independent labels, including two on London's Trouble Records.

===2008–2009: ''Crystal Castles''===
On March 18, 2008, Lies Records collected most of the vinyl singles and released them on CD and 12-inch vinyl for their debut eponymously album titled ''[[Crystal Castles (album)|Crystal Castles]]'', along with many previously unreleased tracks and three songs recorded for the collection.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Ian |url=https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11215-crystal-castles/ |title=Crystal Castles: Crystal Castles |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=March 17, 2008 |access-date=September 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Billboard" /> As Kath had declared, some of the tracks, including "XXZXCUZX ME", were deliberately designed to be grating. This eponymous debut album was included in [[NME]]'s "Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade" list at number 39.<ref name="nme">{{cite magazine | last = Magazine | first = NME | title = The Top 100 Greatest Albums of the Decade | magazine = NME | url = https://www.nme.com/list/the-top-100-greatest-albums-of-the-decade/158049/page/7 | access-date = November 15, 2009}}</ref>

===2010–2011: ''Crystal Castles (II)''===
The band began recording their second album in a variety of locations including an abandoned church in [[Iceland]], a self-built cabin in northern [[Ontario]], a garage behind an abandoned drug store in [[Detroit]], as well as [[Paul Epworth]]'s [[London]] studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://crystalcastles.com/forum/index.php?topic=357 |title=2nd album update |publisher=Crystalcastles.com |accessdate=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630183412/http://crystalcastles.com/forum/index.php?topic=357 |archive-date=2012-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Of the experience, Kath said, "I recorded most of the record in the coldest winter in decades in a church without heat in Iceland.

The group's [[Crystal Castles II|second album]], released variously as ''Crystal Castles'', ''Crystal Castles (II)'', and simply ''(II)'', was released on May 24, 2010. With the release of their second album, their music became more aesthetic and more sharply focused,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14190-crystal-castles/ |title=Pitchfork – reviews – Crystal Castles |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=May 22, 2011}}</ref> mixing synth pop and loud rock sounds with increasing skill.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://allmusic.com/album/crystal-castles-ii-r1813702/review |title=allmusic.com – Crystal Castles (II) review |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=May 22, 2011}}</ref> In April 2010, an early mix of the album leaked, prompting the label to release prior to the originally-planned date of June. The album was moderately successful charting in the UK at number 48, the US at number 188 and number 25 in Australia. The first two singles were "Celestica" and "Baptism". The third single, "Not in Love" featuring [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] from [[The Cure]], became the band's highest-charting single at that time.

In October 2017, on her official website, Glass accused Kath of sexual, physical and mental abuse in explanation of her departure from the band three years prior. The accusations detail events starting when Glass was 15 and began recording with Kath, and escalated until her eventual departure from Crystal Castles.<ref name=snapes /><ref name=holbrook>[https://mixmag.net/read/alice-glass-claims-that-abuse-from-bandmate-made-her-leave-crystal-castles-news "Alice Glass details alleged abuse that forced her to leave Crystal Castles"].

Crystal Castles has since been inactive, having not released any new material or performed any concerts since prematurely ending their tour. It was revealed eight months after Glass' accusations that the band's longtime manager James Sandom no longer worked with the group.<ref name="snapes" /> Glass later disavowed her work with Crystal Castles and asked fans to cease their support of the band.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Richards |first=Will |date=October 15, 2020 |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/alice-glass-says-she-is-being-gutted-over-crystal-castles-royalty-payments-2786266 |title=Alice Glass says she is being "gutted" over Crystal Castles royalty payments |website=[[NME]]|access-date=November 12, 2021}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Crystal Castles' musical style was described by reviewer Jack Shankly as "ferocious, asphyxiating sheets of warped two-dimensional {{sic|[[Game Boy|Gameboy]]}} glitches and bruising drum bombast that pierces your skull with their sheer shrill force, burrowing deep into the brain like a fever."<ref>{{cite web | last = Shankly | first = Jack | title = Underage Festival: wait a minute, these people are all children! | publisher = Drowned in Sound | url = http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/2305247 | access-date = September 4, 2007 | archive-date = November 22, 2012 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6CMBmqUm7?url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/2305247-underage-festival--wait-a-minute-these-people-are-all-children | url-status = dead }}</ref> In a 2008 review for the BBC, Sophie Hammer wrote that to listen to Crystal Castles "is to be cast adrift in a vortex of deafening pain without a safety net.

==Controversies==
===Copyright disputes===
In mid-2008, Crystal Castles were involved in two controversies. ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' and the ''[[Torontoist]]'' blog published stories about Crystal Castles' use of [[Trevor Brown (artist)|Trevor Brown]]'s artwork without his permission.

The issue was resolved after the band bought the rights to use the image from Brown.

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
In October 2017, on her official website, Glass accused Kath of sexual, physical and mental abuse in explanation of her departure from the band. The accusations detail the alleged abuse starting when Glass was 15 and began recording with Kath, and escalated until her eventual departure from Crystal Castles.<ref name=snapes /><ref name=holbrook /> Kath responded the same day in a statement issued to [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] through his attorney, where he called the accusations "pure fiction" and said he was consulting with his lawyers as to his legal options.<ref name=strauss /> Kath sued Glass for defamation<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1970507/crystal-castles-ethan-kath-sues-alice-glass-for-defamation/news/ |title=Crystal Castles' Ethan Kath Sues Alice Glass For Defamation |publisher=Stereogum |last=Rettig |first=James |date=November 3, 2017 |access-date=November 3, 2017}}</ref> but his suit was dismissed by the court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/alice-glass-says-ethan-kaths-defamation-suit-is-dismissed/ |title=Alice Glass Triumphs in Ethan Kath's Defamation Suit |website=Pitchfork|last1=Strauss |first1=Matthew |last2=Minsker |first2=Evan |date=February 23, 2018|access-date=February 23, 2018}}</ref> On December 21, 2017, Police Constable Allyson Douglas-Cook of the Toronto Police Service confirmed that Kath (real name Palmieri) was the subject of a currently open Sex Crimes unit investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/ethan-kath-of-crystal-castles-being-investigated-for-sexual-assault-police-confirm |title=Ethan Kath of Crystal Castles Under Sex Crimes Investigation, Police Confirm |publisher=The Daily Beast Company LLC |last=Zimmerman |first=Amy |date=December 21, 2017}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', Glass and four other women came forward alleging that Kath had sexually preyed on them when they were teenagers and he was in his mid-to-late twenties. With Kath using his fame in Crystal Castles and [[Kill Cheerleader]] to get in contact with them at a young age, the alleged victims stated that he took advantage of their naivety and supplied them with drugs and alcohol in order to coerce them into sexual acts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-indie-rocker-accused-of-sexually-abusing-young-fans |title=The Indie Rocker Accused of Sexually Abusing Young Fans |publisher=The Daily Beast Company LLC |last=Zimmerman |first=Amy |date=February 16, 2018 |access-date=November 21, 2021}}</ref>

Glass later gave an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' and further elaborated on Kath's behavior towards her, commenting that he had thrown her out of a moving car, torn her hair out, lied about the nature of her rib injury, and had at several points gone against doctor's orders and made her perform after receiving a concussion. Kath also held onto Glass' passport and controlled her finances, never letting Glass have her own cell phone or credit card until a couple of years before she left. Glass also mentioned that if she ever thought of leaving Crystal Castles, Kath would threaten to replace her with someone "who's a better singer and who would put up with a lot worse than [she] would". After discovering that Kath had done similar actions towards other women, Glass felt it was her responsibility to come forward.<ref name="snapes" />
