==Biography==
James was born '''Elmore Brooks''' in [[Richland, Holmes County, Mississippi]], the illegitimate son of 15-year-old Leola Brooks, a field hand.<ref name="AMG"/> His father was probably Joe Willie "Frost" James,<ref name="auto"/> who moved in with Leola, and Elmore took his surname. He began making music at the age of 12, using a simple one-string instrument ([[diddley bow]], or jitterbug) strung on a shack wall.<ref name="auto"/> As a teen he performed at dances under the names Cleanhead and Joe Willie James.<ref name="AMG"/> He married Minnie Mae about 1942.<ref name=Amazing>Franz, Steve (2003). ''The Amazing Secret History of Elmore James''. BlueSource Publications. {{ISBN|978-097180-381-7}}</ref>

James was influenced by [[Robert Johnson]],<ref name="auto"/> [[Kokomo Arnold]] and [[Tampa Red]]. He recorded several of Tampa Red's songs. He also inherited from Tampa Red's band two musicians who joined his own backing band, the Broomdusters, [[Little Johnny Jones (pianist)|"Little" Johnny Jones]] (piano) and [[Odie Payne]] (drums).<ref name="AMG"/> There is a dispute about whether Johnson or James wrote James's signature song, "[[Dust My Broom]]".<ref name="Amazing"/> In the late 1930s, James worked alongside [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]].<ref name="AMG"/>

During [[World War II]], James joined the [[United States Navy]], was promoted to [[coxswain]] and took part in the invasion of [[Guam]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|year=1981|author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/206 206]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/206}}</ref> Upon his discharge, he returned to central Mississippi and settled in the town of [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]] with his adopted brother Robert Holston. Working in Holston's electrical shop, he devised his unique electric sound, using parts from the shop and an unusual placement of two [[Harry DeArmond|DeArmond]] pickups.<ref name=Amazing /> Around this time James learned that he had a serious heart condition.

He began recording with [[Trumpet Records]] in nearby Jackson in January 1951, first as a sideman again for Sonny Boy Williamson II and for their mutual friend [[Willie Love]] and possibly others.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|year=1981|author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/212 212-213]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/212}}</ref> He made his debut as a session leader in August with "Dust My Broom", which was a surprise R&B hit in 1952.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> His backing musicians became known as the Broomdusters.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

James broke his contract with Trumpet Records to sign with the [[Bihari brothers]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|year=1981|author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/214 214]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/214}}</ref> through their scout [[Ike Turner]], who played guitar and piano on a couple of his early Bihari recordings. His "I Believe" was a hit a year later.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> During the 1950s he recorded for the Bihari brothers' [[Flair Records]], [[Meteor Records]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~jaymar41/meteor.html|title=Meteor Records|access-date=2006-11-06|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66Ye22kix?url=http://home.earthlink.net/~jaymar41/meteor.html|archive-date=March 30, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Modern Records]]; he also recorded for [[Chess Records]] and [[Mel London]]'s [[Chief Records]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Top R&B Singles 1942–1988|publisher=Record Research|year=1988|page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whit/page/216 216]|isbn=978-0-89820-068-3|url=https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whit/page/216}}</ref> He played lead guitar on [[Big Joe Turner]]'s 1954 top 10 R&B hit "TV Mama".<ref>Swyner, Alan (1998). Liner notes to ''The Very Best of Big Joe Turner''. Rhino CD 72968.</ref>

In 1959, he began recording for [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]]'s [[Fire Records]], which released "[[The Sky Is Crying (song)|The Sky Is Crying]]", "[[Bleeding Heart (song)|My Bleeding Heart]]", "Stranger Blues", "[[Look on Yonder Wall]]", "Done Somebody Wrong", and "[[Shake Your Moneymaker (song)|Shake Your Moneymaker]]", among others.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

James died of a heart attack in Chicago in 1963,<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> as he was about to tour Europe with that year's [[American Folk Blues Festival]]. He was buried in the Newport Baptist Church Cemetery, in [[Ebenezer, Mississippi]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://msbluestrail.org/blues-trail-markers/elmore-james|title=Elmore James|website=Mississippi Blues Trail}}</ref> [[Phil Walden]] of [[Capricorn Records]] raised funds for a granite headstone for James' grave. The headstone which reads "King of the Slide Guitar", features a bronze [[relief]] of James playing guitar. It was revealed at a dedication ceremony sponsored by the [[Mount Zion Memorial Fund|Mt. Zion Memorial Fund]] in 1992.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.msbluestrail.org/featured_elmore_james|title=Featured Marker - Elmore James|website=Mississippi Blues Trail}}</ref>

James was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1992 as an "Early Influence" inductee.<ref name=":0" /> In 2012, he was honored with a marker on the [[Mississippi Blues Trail]] in Ebenezer.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

James was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

==Sound==
James played a wide variety of "blues" (which often crossed over into other styles of music) similar to that of [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]] and some of [[B. B. King]]'s work, but distinguished by his guitar's unique tone, coming from a modified hollow-body [[acoustic guitar]] that sounded like an amped-up version of the more "modern" [[solid body|solid-body]] guitars.

Muddy Waters took Belgian blues fan George Adins to see James play in Chicago in 1959; Adins described James' vocals as "strong and rough", and his guitar accompaniment as similarly "rough, violent and expressive." Adins also praised a later performance for its "hysteric" sound.<ref>Bromberg liner notes to the compilation ''The Legend of Elmore James'' (Kent Records 9001).</ref>

==Influence==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}
Many electric [[slide guitar]] players will acknowledge the influence of James's style. He was a major influence on such notable blues guitarists as [[Homesick James]], [[John Littlejohn]], [[Hound Dog Taylor]], [[J. B. Hutto]] and many others.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/elmore-james-mn0000176936/biography|title=Elmore James - Biography & History|author=Cub Koda|author-link=Cub Koda|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> He also influenced many rock guitarists, such as [[Brian Jones]], of the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] ([[Keith Richards]] wrote {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} that when they first met, Jones was calling himself Elmo Lewis and wanted to be Elmore James); [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]], of [[Canned Heat]]; and [[Jeremy Spencer]], of [[Fleetwood Mac]]. [[John Mayall]] recorded "Mr. James" for his 1969 album ''Looking Back'' as an homage to James. James's songs "Done Somebody Wrong" and "[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]" were covered by the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]], which was influenced by James.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bluessingersbiog00dica|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/bluessingersbiog00dica/page/102 102]|quote=allman brothers influence elmore james.|title=Blues Singers|year=1999|publisher=McFarland|access-date=2013-06-02|author=Dicaire, David|isbn=9780786406067}}</ref>

James's compositions were also covered by the blues-rock band [[Stevie Ray Vaughan|Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble]] many times in concert. The most famous of these covers is one that came by an indirect route: the bluesman [[Albert King]] recorded a cover of "The Sky Is Crying", and Vaughan copied King's version. That song was also covered by [[George Thorogood]] on his second album, ''[[Move It On Over (album)|Move It on Over]]'', and by Eric Clapton on his album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]''. Another admirer of James was [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Early in his career Hendrix styled himself as Maurice James and subsequently as Jimmy James, in tribute to Elmore James, according to his former bandmate and recording partner [[Lonnie Youngblood]].<ref>Egan, Sean (2002). ''The Making of "Are You Experienced"''. A Capella Books. p. 14. {{ISBN|978-155652-471-4}}</ref> A photo on the sleeve of his album ''[[Blues (Jimi Hendrix album)|Blues]]'' shows Hendrix in London, holding James's UK LP ''The Best of Elmore James.'' (Hendrix was frequently photographed holding LP covers of musicians that influenced him.) He performed James's "Bleeding Heart" at the Experience's [[Royal Albert Hall]] concert in 1969 and also with the [[Band of Gypsys]] at their New Year's concerts at the Fillmore East in 1969–70, and he recorded two versions of it in the studio.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

James is mentioned in the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]' song "[[For You Blue]]": while [[John Lennon]] evokes James's signature sound with a [[Höfner]] 5140 Hawaiian Standard [[lap steel guitar]],<ref>Babiuk, A, (2002). ''Beatles Gear''. Hal Leonard. p. 241. {{ISBN|978-087930-662-5}}</ref> [[George Harrison]] says, "Elmore James got nothin' on this, baby."

[[Frank Zappa]] acknowledged James as an influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.online.no/~corneliu/gp83.htm |title=Guitar Player Magazine, 1983 |publisher=Home.online.no |date=January 9, 1984 |access-date=2011-12-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223154857/http://home.online.no/~corneliu/gp83.htm |archive-date=February 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

[[Eric Burdon]] performed the song "No More Elmore" on the album ''Crawling King Snake'' (1982).

[[Roy Buchanan]], for his ''Second Album'' (1974), recorded "Tribute to Elmore James", an instrumental piece Buchanan wrote, which begins with James's classic slide guitar riff and uses his soloing style throughout.
