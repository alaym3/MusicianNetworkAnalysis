In May 2013, Turner set up a fundraising campaign on [[crowdfunding]] website [[Indiegogo]] for an [[iOS]] (and later [[Android (operating system)|Android]]) game based on his ''Tobuscus Adventures'' YouTube series, called ''Tobuscus Adventures: Wizards!''.<ref name="Indiegogo">{{cite web |url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-bring-tobuscus-adventures-the-game-to-pc |title=Help Bring Tobuscus Adventures: THE GAME to PC! |last=Turner |first=Toby |author-link=Toby Turner |publisher=[[Indiegogo]] |access-date=June 26, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/05/21/toby-turner-tobuscus-adventures-game-indiegogo/ |title=Toby Turner Seeks $240,000 on Indiegogo for 'Tobuscus Adventures' Game |last=Gutelle |first=Sam |publisher=[[Tubefilter]] |date=May 21, 2013 |access-date=May 21, 2013 }}</ref> The fundraiser surpassed its goal of $240,000 within two days, reaching more than $644,000.<ref name="BI" /> The game features Turner as main character Tobuscus as he fights off hordes of zombies to get to the Wizard of Darkness,<ref name="Indiegogo"/><ref name="Wizards characters">{{cite magazine |url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2013/05/toby-turner-starts-indiegogo-campaign-for-a-tobuscus-video-game-video/ |title=Toby Turner Starts Indiegogo Campaign For A 'Tobuscus' Video Game |last=Klima |first=Jeff |magazine=New Media Rockstars |date=May 21, 2013 |access-date=June 26, 2013 }}</ref> and also cameos Gabe Hohreiter as Gabuscus, and Turner's dog Gryphon.<ref name="Wizards characters"/> The game was released in March 2015 for iOS and later for Android,<ref>{{cite web|title=TOBUSCUS GAME IS NOW AVAILABLE!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSPkpFqRCW4|website=YouTube|access-date=March 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tobuscus Adventures: Wizards|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tobuscus-adventures-wizards/id916585802?mt=8|website=iTunes|access-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref> and in May 2018 for PC,<ref>{{cite web|title=TOBUSCUS ADVENTURES WIZARDS on PC|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddeiYOCGUlY&t=516s&app=desktop|website=YouTube|access-date=9 May 2018}}</ref> with plans to extend this to [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]].<ref name="Heavy">{{cite web|last1=Fennimore|first1=Jack|title=Tobuscus Interview: How He Navigates YouTube's Landscape Today|url=https://heavy.com/games/2018/01/tobuscus-interview-youtube-demonetization-copyright-tobygames/|website=Heavy.com|date=January 10, 2018|access-date=17 January 2018}}</ref> Before the release of ''Tobuscus Adventures: Wizards!'', Toby also revealed that a second, albeit smaller game, was in development at the same time and based on the popular sandbox game ''[[Minecraft]]'', titled "Mine The Diamond", which was later released in June 2015 for iOS.<ref>{{cite web|title=FREE iOS GAME!: MINE the DIAMOND|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLwSQYp0VQ|website=YouTube|access-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mine The Diamond|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mine-the-diamond/id956294274?mt=8|website=iTunes|access-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref>

In May 2014, Turner signed a three-book deal with Tegen Books, an imprint of Harper Collins, to help create an illustrated journal-style series based on ''Tobuscus Adventures''. The first, second, and third books were published in the fall of 2015, summer of 2016, and winter 2017, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube Star Toby Turner Turns Web Series into Three-Book Deal|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/youtube-star-toby-turner-turns-703364|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 13, 2014|access-date=March 4, 2015}}</ref> A fourth book is scheduled to be published in 2018.<ref name="Heavy" />

Turner was chosen to voice the character of Ant-Man/Scott Lang for the 2016 mobile game ''[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021|reason=Citation before claimed to link a Tweet, but instead redirected to an IMDb page of the show.}}

==Reception==
Within the first few years of his three channels running concurrently, Turner was considered one of the most popular [[List of YouTubers|YouTube personalities]], later recognised as a "mainstay",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menegus|first1=Bryan|title=Another Prominent YouTuber Has Been Accused of Rape|url=https://gizmodo.com/another-prominent-youtuber-has-been-accused-of-rape-1770478639|website=Gizmodo|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref> "pioneer",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamedy|first1=Saba|title=YouTube star Tobuscus accused of sexual assault, calls allegations 'false'|url=http://mashable.com/2016/04/11/toby-tobuscus-turner-sexual-assault-allegations/#T6CSiQqctgqr|website=Mashable|date=April 12, 2016|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref> and "one of the site's greatest innovators."<ref name="BI" /> However, according to Social Blade, which tracks YouTube channel statistics, recognition gradually began to waver from around late 2013; for each one of his channels, the number of new subscribers and total views per month began to steadily decrease, coupled with an increasingly number of people unsubscribing over those joining. Although Turner was met with much attention as a result of the sexual abuse allegations made against him in 2016, the trend nonetheless continued.<ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube Statistics for Tobuscus (23 December 2015â€“21 January 2016)|work=Social Blade|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/tobuscus/monthly|access-date=20 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121172314/http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/tobuscus/monthly|archive-date=January 21, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube Statistics for TobyGames (19 February 2016â€“19 March 2016)|work=Social Blade|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/tobygames/monthly|access-date=20 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319151350/http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/tobygames/monthly|archive-date=March 19, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=YouTube Statistics for TobyTurner (14 March 2016â€“12 April 2016)|work=Social Blade|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/tobyturner/monthly|access-date=20 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413014244/http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/tobyturner/monthly|archive-date=April 13, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Turner has on occasion expressed how his channels have suffered from management issues on YouTube that ultimately restricts how many video views he receives. For example, in an interview with ''[[Heavy.com|Heavy]]'' in 2018 and a video uploaded in 2019 titled ''Dear Algorithm'', he stated that content creators such as himself were occasionally not appearing in subscribers feeds and as a result the majority of his subscribers were not notified when he uploaded new content.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fennimore|first1=Jack|title=How He Navigates YouTube's Landscape Today|url=https://heavy.com/games/2018/01/tobuscus-interview-youtube-demonetization-copyright-tobygames/|website=Heavy.com|date=January 10, 2018|access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dear Algorithm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gY_v-T9kAM |website=YouTube}}</ref> Turner has also attempted to reach out to YouTube directly, such as in 2017 tweeting to their administration that neither the subscribe button nor the more recently introduced bell icon, which immediately notified subscribers of new uploads, were working properly at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dear @YTCreators The Subscribe button & the Bell don't work.

Harrison Jacobs of ''Business Insider'' in 2014 meanwhile wrote of how Turner had been pursuing various projects outside of YouTube. He found that while he still published frequently to his channels, he seemed particularly devoted to other work in the hope that it could direct him into more "traditional media", citing Turner's first book based on his web series ''Tobuscus Animated Adventures'', as well as his mobile game ''Tobuscus Adventures: Wizards!''. Jacobs noted how the development of the game, which ultimately took place over an almost two-year period,<ref>{{cite web|title=WE DID IT, GRYPHON! - Tobuscus Adventures: The Game - UPDATE|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njzX9ZiZvPo|website=YouTube|access-date=24 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TOBUSCUS GAME IS NOW AVAILABLE!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSPkpFqRCW4&index=107&list=PLz9qcY9C1aHocL1RVYdmclNIGCdSdKNSm|website=YouTube|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref> had run over-budget, despite having received more than double the requested funds, and had been met with a number of delays, which Turner himself ascribed to a lack of experience.<ref name="BI" />

Turner has at times responded in a tongue-in-cheek manner to the evidence and comments made towards the popularity of his three channels, expressing little concern,<ref>{{cite web|title=RIP Toby Turner Vlog Channel :(|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABxPjkAqo_Q|website=YouTube|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=LIVE: TobyGames Streams FALLING SUBSCRIBER COUNT IN REALTIME|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MqAD6-ez-4&t=243s#t=02m10s|website=YouTube|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref> and at one point asking for a more positive outlook as his earliest videos had similar view counts to his current material.<ref>{{cite web|title=R.I.P.

===Sexual assault allegations===
On April 8, 2016, Turner's ex-girlfriend April Fletcher, known online as AprilEfff, made several allegations against the YouTuber, including that he was addicted to drugs, that he had cheated on several of his former partners (including Fletcher), and that he drugged and [[Rape|raped]] her in February 2013.<ref name="nydailynews">{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/youtube-star-toby-tobuscus-turner-accused-alleged-rape-article-1.2596563 |title=YouTube star Toby 'Tobuscus' Turner accused of alleged of rape, denies claims |last=Settembre |first=Jeanette |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=April 11, 2016 |access-date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref><ref name="gameranx">{{cite news |url=http://gameranx.com/features/id/47815/article/popular-gaming-youtuber-tobuscus-accused-of-rape-drug-abuse/ |title=Popular Gaming YouTuber Tobuscus accused of Rape, Drug Abuse |last=Monroe |first=Nick |publisher=Gameranx |date=April 9, 2016 |access-date=April 9, 2016 }}</ref> Writing a blog post on [[Tumblr]], Fletcher claimed that she had contemplated suicide following the episodes, and that Turner had likely committed the same acts to other women.<ref name="gameranx"/> YouTuber and ex-girlfriend of Turner, Amelia Talon, corroborated Fletcher's accounts shortly after, alleging that she had been drugged by Turner as well.<ref name="nydailynews"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/youtube-personality-faces-rape-allegations|title=YouTube Personality Star Faces Rape Allegations|author=Stillman, Keith|date=April 19, 2016|access-date=August 25, 2019|work=[[Odyssey (publication)|Odyssey]]}}</ref> On April 9, 2016, Jaclyn Glenn, another of Turner's ex-girlfriends, posted a video on YouTube responding to the allegations.

Turner responded to the accusations on April 11, 2016. In a short video, he dubbed Fletcher's claims as "false" and claimed that he had "never done anything without her consent [and] never tried to trick her into anything".<ref name="nydailynews"/>

On June 14, 2018, Turner released another video titled "[[Me Too movement|#MeToo]] ...late?" where he claims he was advised not to say anything when the Tumblr post was published, then proceeds to give his accounts of what happened. In the video he insists nothing wrong occurred that night, just him letting a friend (Fletcher) sleep over at his house, due to her insisting she was too afraid to return home that late at night. He also claims that Fletcher wanted a romantic relationship with him, while he wanted only to remain friends. In the video, Turner also suggests Fletcher hinted at making a Tumblr post falsely accusing him of rape.<ref>{{cite web|title=#MeToo ...late?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnQZr6xRRa8|website=YouTube|access-date=18 June 2018}}</ref>

As a result of the allegations, Turner was replaced as the voice of Ant-Man/Scott Lang for ''Marvel Avengers Academy''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avengers Academy Word of God|url=http://avengersacademywog.tumblr.com/post/142914937227/re-ant-mans-voice|website=Tumblr|access-date=17 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113065652/http://avengersacademywog.tumblr.com/post/142914937227/re-ant-mans-voice|archive-date=2018-11-13}}</ref>
