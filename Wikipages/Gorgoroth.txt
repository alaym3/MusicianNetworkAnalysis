'''Gorgoroth''' is a Norwegian [[black metal]] band based in [[Bergen]]. It was formed in 1992 by guitarist [[Infernus]], who is also the only original member remaining, and the band have since released nine studio albums. Gorgoroth are a [[Satanism|Satanic]] band and have drawn controversy due to some of their concerts, which have featured impaled sheep heads and mock crucifixions. The band is named after the dead plateau of darkness in the land of [[Mordor]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==History==

===Early years (1992–1995)===

Gorgoroth was founded in 1992 by guitarist [[Infernus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gorgoroth.info/biography/ |title=Gorgoroth – Band |publisher=Gorgoroth.info |access-date=2009-08-10}}</ref> In 1993, the band released their first demo, entitled ''[[A Sorcery Written in Blood]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gorgoroth.info/sorcery.htm |title=Gorgoroth – Albums |publisher=Gorgoroth.info |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331141646/http://www.gorgoroth.info/sorcery.htm |archive-date=March 31, 2009 }}</ref> On January 7, 1994, Firda, the major newspaper in the county of [[Sogn og Fjordane]] where the band originated from, ran a cover story on the demo, with the headline "Local music with Satanic symbolism". According to the article, the release of the demo and flyers with Satanic symbols led to "concerned parents contacting the Sheriff's Office in Fjaler".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfu.no/case.php?id=324 |title=PFU-sak nr 94-018 |publisher=Pfu.no |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509072210/http://www.pfu.no/case.php?id=324 |archive-date=2013-05-09 }}</ref> After the demo was released, Gorgoroth signed a record deal with Embassy Productions and started work on their debut full-length ''[[Pentagram (Gorgoroth album)|Pentagram]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gorgoroth.info/pentagram.htm |title=Gorgoroth – Albums |publisher=Gorgoroth.info |access-date=2009-08-10 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095919/http://www.gorgoroth.info/pentagram.htm |archive-date = June 23, 2008}}</ref> When bassist Kjettar left the band in 1993, [[Samoth]] of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] joined Gorgoroth as their new bassist, and participated in the recording of the album. After ''[[Pentagram (Gorgoroth album)|Pentagram]]'' was completed and released in 1994, drummer Goat left the band and was replaced by [[Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad|Frost]] from [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]]. The band performed their first concert at Lusa Lottes Pøbb in [[Oslo, Norway]], on May 3, 1994, at a four-day Black Metal Nights festival with bands such as [[Dark Funeral]] (who also made their live debut), [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]] (who played their first gig abroad), [[Gehenna (band)|Gehenna]] and [[Hades Almighty]].<ref name="dissection-pastshows">{{cite web|url=http://www.dissection.nu/pastshows.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070925081233/http://www.dissection.nu/pastshows.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-25 |title=Www.Dissection.Nu – Official Dissection Website |access-date=2015-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackmetal.nu/~ubc/files/euronewsletter.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205183022/http://www.blackmetal.nu/~ubc/files/euronewsletter.htm |archive-date=2008-12-05 |title=Euronymous Newsletter |date=1993 |access-date=2015-10-19}}</ref>

This was followed by gigs with [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]] in [[Bergen]] (in June and September) and in [[Haugesund]] (in November), and the band performed their first gig abroad in [[Annaberg-Buchholz]] in Germany on December 10, 1994. The same year, the band commenced the recording of ''[[Antichrist (Gorgoroth album)|Antichrist]]'' (originally titled ''Død''), their second full-length album.

===With Pest (1995–1997)===
[[File:Pest and nfernus.jpg|thumb|[[Pest (musician)|Pest]] (left) and [[Infernus]] in 2010]]
Vocalist [[Hat (Gorgoroth vocalist)|Hat]] decided to leave Gorgoroth in September 1995, but agreed to finish recording the vocal tracks for ''[[Antichrist (Gorgoroth album)|Antichrist]]''. After Hat left, Infernus recruited vocalist [[Pest (musician)|Pest]] from [[Obtained Enslavement]] as Gorgoroth's new vocalist. In December 1995, the band supported [[Cradle of Filth]] at the [[London Astoria]], a show which also included the band [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.primordialweb.com/prim_tour.htm |title=primordial_main |publisher=Primordialweb.com |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722110938/http://primordialweb.com/prim_tour.htm |archive-date=2009-07-22 }}</ref> This marked the first Gorgoroth live appearance of both vocalist Pest and bassist [[Ares (musician)|Ares]]. In 1995 the band had been offered a record deal with [[Moonfog Productions]], but this offer was rejected in favour of an offer made by German label [[Malicious Records]]. [[Malicious Records]] released the band's second album, ''[[Antichrist (Gorgoroth album)|Antichrist]]'', in 1996, and also re-released the debut album ''[[Pentagram (Gorgoroth album)|Pentagram]]''. The band went on a European tour with [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] and [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]] in April 1996,<ref name="dissection-pastshows" /> followed by a one-off gig in [[Bergen]] with Hades Almighty and Gehenna, at which the live EP ''[[The Last Tormentor]]'' was recorded. The band also played a one-off gig in the fall in [[Bischofswerda]], Germany, with [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]]. Soon the name Gorgoroth was commonplace in the black metal underground, both in Norway and in the rest of Europe, if somewhat overshadowed by some of the more famous black metal bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] or [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]. The band's third full-length album, ''[[Under the Sign of Hell]]'', was recorded in spring 1996, and guitarist [[Tormentor (musician)|Tormentor]] joined the band later in the year. ''[[Under the Sign of Hell]]'' was released in 1997, and Gorgoroth went on their first headlining European tour in fall 1997, with support by [[Mystic Circle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetslyrics.com/bio-Mystic%20Circle.html |title=MYSTIC CIRCLE Biography |publisher=Sweetslyrics.com |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325001203/http://www.sweetslyrics.com/bio-Mystic%20Circle.html |archive-date=2009-03-25 }}</ref> It was on this tour that Infernus and Tormentor were approached by the major German [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[record label]] [[Nuclear Blast]], who wanted to sign the band. The band accepted the offer in late 1997.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Tenure with Nuclear Blast (1997–2003)===
The move to [[Nuclear Blast]] was controversial among many black metal enthusiasts who pertained to the tenets of an 'underground black metal scene'.<ref name="nuclear-blast-dis">{{cite web |url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/gorgoroth.html |title=Interview with Gaahl @ Tatareandesire |publisher=Tartareandesire.com |date=2004-10-07 |access-date=2009-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214650/http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/gorgoroth.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first album recorded and released for Nuclear Blast was ''[[Destroyer (Gorgoroth album)|Destroyer]]'' (1998). New singer [[Gaahl]] joined the band at this time, but was heard on only one song, the title track "Destroyer". The music and lyrics on the album were mainly written by Infernus, but guitarist Tormentor also contributed as composer, most notably on the title track, and former vocalist Pest wrote the lyrics on 4 tracks. In May 1998, Gorgoroth played five dates in Germany on [[Cradle of Filth]]'s European tour, with support from [[Old Man's Child]] and [[Einherjer]].<ref>[http://www.cradleoffilth.com/History.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004144811/http://www.cradleoffilth.com/History.html |date=October 4, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pushposters.co.uk/cgi/pcart/showitem.cgi?item=a14391 |title=CRADLE OF FILTH posters & t-shirts - Buy CRADLE OF FILTH posters & t-shirts at Pushposters.com |publisher=Pushposters.co.uk |date=1998-03-28 |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331150727/http://www.pushposters.co.uk/cgi/pcart/showitem.cgi?item=a14391 |archive-date=2009-03-31 }}</ref> Gorgoroth also performed at [[Wacken Open Air]] in summer 1998,<ref>[http://www.wacken.com/typo3temp/pics/e0b6ef8a8a.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927210100/http://www.wacken.com/typo3temp/pics/e0b6ef8a8a.jpg |date=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> and performed at the [[Tuska Open Air Metal Festival]] in [[Helsinki, Finland]], and in [[Oslo, Norway]] with Gehenna and [[Dødheimsgard]].<ref>[http://www.ludewigs.net/gehenna/bio.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205234832/http://www.ludewigs.net/gehenna/bio.htm |date=February 5, 2012 }}</ref>

In 1999, Gorgoroth began journeying into unknown territory with the recording of ''[[Incipit Satan]]''. Though mainly written by Infernus once again, the album delved into musical ideas not expanded upon by the group in previous recordings. Songs such as "Will to Power" showcased strong [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[dark ambient]], and [[Noise music|noise]] influences (more so than on ''Destroyer'' and ''Under the Sign of Hell'', both of which showed signs of experimentation). The song "When Love Rages Wild in My Heart" featured clean, [[blues]]y vocals. Overall, the album displayed [[Progressive metal|progressive]] tendencies, yet still retained a traditional black metal edge and Infernus' signature sound. The album was recorded during 1999, after drummer Vrolok and bassist T-Reaper had left the band and been replaced by drummer [[Erlend Erichsen]] (a.k.a. Sjt. Erichsen) and bassist [[King (musician)|King ov Hell]]. Drummer Erlend Erichsen left the band after the recordings were finished, and ''[[Incipit Satan]]'' was released in [[2000 in music|2000]], preceded by a European tour in December [[1999 in music|1999]], supporting [[Morbid Angel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.morbidangel.com/press.html |title=Press Releases |publisher=MorbidAngel.com |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715075417/http://www.morbidangel.com/press.html |archive-date=2009-07-15 }}</ref> In May, [[2000 in music|2000]], Gorgoroth headlined a European tour, with bands like [[Old Man's Child]] and [[Krisiun]] as supporting acts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetslyrics.com/bio-Krisiun.html |title=Krisiun Biography |publisher=Sweetslyrics.com |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002152220/http://www.sweetslyrics.com/bio-Krisiun.html |archive-date=2011-10-02 }}</ref> In early June 2000, Gorgoroth performed at the first [[Hole in the Sky]] festival in Bergen, Norway. This festival was arranged in memory of former Gorgoroth drummer Grim, and also included bands such as [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Obtained Enslavement]], [[Hades Almighty]] and [[Aeternus]]. On June 23, 2000, Gorgoroth headlined the "Knüppelnacht" stage at the [[With Full Force]] festival in [[Leipzig, Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.withfullforce.de/english/2000/framehaupt.html |title=With Full Force – Summer Open Air |publisher=Withfullforce.de |access-date=2009-08-10 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622235524/http://www.withfullforce.de/english/2000/framehaupt.html |archive-date = June 22, 2008}}</ref>

After a couple of Norwegian concerts in 2000 and 2001, Gorgoroth made their hitherto only live appearance in the US, at the Milwaukee Metalfest in August 2001. In September and October 2001, the band went on two mini tours of Mexico and Colombia. In 2001 Gorgoroth was also featured on a [[tribute album]] to the Norwegian [[black metal]] band Mayhem, with a [[cover version]] of that band's "Life Eternal" from the ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' album. This song had been recorded in [[1998 in music|1998]], and featured [[Gaahl]] on vocals, as well as Infernus and Tormentor on rhythm guitars, T-Reaper on lead guitar and bass, and Vrolok on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gorgoroth.info/tribute.htm |title=Gorgoroth – Albums |publisher=Gorgoroth.info |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326112331/http://www.gorgoroth.info/tribute.htm |archive-date=March 26, 2009 }}</ref> This is the only released Gorgoroth recording which has not appeared on a full-length Gorgoroth album. In February 2002, vocalist Gaahl was taken into custody after being accused of having beaten a man at an after-party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ba.no/nyheter/article1472479.ece |title=Gorgoroth-vokalist må i fengsel – ba.no |publisher=ba.no<! |access-date=2009-08-10}}</ref> This led to him having to serve 9 months in prison in 2002, due to an already existing unserved 1-year sentence for previously committed acts of violence. He was released from prison in December 2002.{{cn|date=May 2021}}

In [[2002 in music|2002]], Tormentor decided to quit the band due to no longer being able to cooperate with King,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=5578 |title=GORGOROTH Commence Recording New CD |work=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=2009-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocknballs.com/?choix=interviews&old=interviews&id_interview=33&PHPSESSID=7de87b14418f567ea9ba1475b54b43a7#english |title=ROCK 'N BALLS &#124;&#124;&#124; Webzine Metal-Rock |publisher=Rocknballs.com |date=2007-09-13 |access-date=2009-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715195026/http://www.rocknballs.com/?choix=interviews&old=interviews&id_interview=33&PHPSESSID=7de87b14418f567ea9ba1475b54b43a7#english |archive-date=2011-07-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ending the stable 5-piece line-up of Gaahl, Infernus, Tormentor, King ov Hell and [[Kvitrafn]], which had been formed in 2000. After Tormentor's departure, Gorgoroth began writing their new album, ''[[Twilight of the Idols (Gorgoroth album)|Twilight of the Idols]]''. The album showed a return to a more solidified black metal style, but was still quite different from early Gorgoroth releases, mainly due to the fact that most of the album's songs were written by bassist King and drummer Kvitrafn rather than Infernus. The band played their first live gig in a year and a half at Garage in Bergen in April 2003, with Tormentor returning as guitarist for a one-off show.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://site.voila.fr/NIHILISTIC/Reviews/Gigs/taakegorgoroth.htm |title=GORGOROTH, TAAKE, Live at "Garage", Bergen (Norway) |publisher=Site.voila.fr |access-date=2009-08-10}}</ref> [[Twilight of the Idols (Gorgoroth album)|''Twilight of the Idols'']] was released by [[Nuclear Blast]] in May 2003,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=9549 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130413161927/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=9549 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-04-13 |title=GORGOROTH Complete Work On New Album |work=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=2009-08-10 }}</ref> and the band subsequently performed at the [[Hole in the Sky]] festival in Bergen in August 2003.

===Controversy in Kraków (2004)===
{{Main article|Black Mass Krakow 2004}}

[[File:Gorgoroth by Christian Misje.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Video shoot for "Carving a Giant", a recreation of the controversial Kraków performance.]]

On February 1, 2004, during a concert being recorded for a DVD in [[Kraków, Poland]], the band displayed sheep heads on stakes, a bloodbath of 80 litres of sheep's blood, Satanic symbols, and four naked crucified models on stage. A police investigation took place with allegations of religious offence (which is prosecutable under Polish law) and cruelty to animals.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Tisdall |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Norwegian black metal band shocks Poland – Aftenposten.no |publisher=Aftenposten.no<! |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309110157/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |archive-date=2009-03-09 }}</ref> Though these charges were considered, the band was not charged as it was ruled that they were unaware of the fact that what they were doing was illegal, although the concert organiser was eventually fined 10,000 [[Polish złoty|zł]] in 2007 as he knew about it and neither informed the band that it was against the law nor intervened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muzyka.onet.pl/10175,1561013,newsy.html |title=Organizator koncertu Gorgoroth skazany!

Gorgoroth further secured a reputation as a band with a vehement anti-[[Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path|Right Hand Path]] agenda, regarding which certain employees in the company were alleged to have felt uneasy due to their own personal beliefs.<ref name="nuclear-blast-dis"/>

After a successful South American tour of Brazil, Chile and Argentina, and a performance at Norway's [[Inferno Festival]], it was announced in April 2004 that drummer Kvitrafn had decided to leave the band.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=21650 |title=GORGOROTH Confirm Drummer's Departure |work=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=2009-08-10}}</ref> For the band's European and [[Central America]]n headlining tours of October and November 2004, drummer Dirge Rep (ex-[[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Gehenna (band)|Gehenna]]) and guitarist Teloch ([[Nidingr (band)|Nidingr]]) were recruited.

===''Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam'' (2005–2007)===
After various shows around Europe in the first half of 2005, including the [[With Full Force Festival]] in July, Gorgoroth then went out on a month-long European tour with [[1349 (band)|1349]] in November 2005, this time with Skagg (Gaahlskagg) replacing Teloch as live guitarist. On December 10, 2005, Gorgoroth played live in [[Trondheim]], Norway, a gig which was to be their last live performance until summer 2007.

Gorgoroth released ''[[Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam]]'' in June 2006 through [[Regain Records]]. This was only the second Gorgoroth album to be released since 2000's ''[[Incipit Satan]]'' – a noticeable reduction in productivity from a band that had previously released 2 demos, 5 full-length albums and 1 live EP between 1993 and 2000. For the recording of the new album, Frost again performed on the drums. This album helped the band to expand its fan base. A short time after the album was released, bassist King quit the band. According to the official website, King left because he "had problems fronting some of the ideological aspects of his band GORGOROTH's agenda".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54264 |title=Gorgoroth Part Ways With Bassist King Ov Hell |work=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=2009-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/12178/tempidx/5/menuid/3 |title=Gorgoroth Feature Interview At Blistering.com |magazine=[[Blistering]] |date=2007-11-22 |access-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420160107/http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/12178/tempidx/5/menuid/3 |archive-date=2008-04-20 }}</ref> In an interview made shortly after quitting the band, he confirmed he had problems with the ideology in public, but not in his private life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/interviews/730/Gorgoroth.html |title=Gorgoroth – Heavy Metal – News – Gorgoroth Videos – Gorgoroth Ringtones – mp3s – Tabs – Wallpaper – lyrics |publisher=The Gauntlet |date=2009-04-03 |access-date=2009-08-10}}</ref> Gorgoroth was nominated in the "Metal" category at the 35th annual [[Spellemannprisen|Spellemann Awards]] for this album (the Norwegian equivalent to the [[Grammy Award]]s).

|quote      = Gorgoroth was founded by Infernus in 1992 as a strategy to perpetrate sonic and spiritual violence upon the world in order to bring forth change in peoples perception of being therein. Thus, through metal music, Satans minister on earth summoned an avatara of the forces of darkness and did let it manifestate through a variety of attempts on creating what was perceived as ultimate black metal taking form on stage as well as in a variety of studio recordings. [...] With the devoted presence of the new full time members Gaahl and King, as well as a not a day too early achieved social and mental fundament for future work, a deal was inked with the german label Nuclear Blast and the band to a bigger extent adopted the position as a live performance act taking upon them several tours worldwide bringing its sinister presence and the word of Satan to new territories...

In an interview for the 2005 heavy metal documentary ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]'', Gaahl was asked what inspired Gorgoroth's music and his reply was simply "Satan". When asked what he believes Satan represents, he said "Freedom".<ref name="headbanger">{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0478209/ |title=Metal: A Headbanger's Journey (2005) |publisher=IMDb |access-date=2015-10-19}}</ref>

Gaahl explained his use of Satanic and anti-Christian themes: "We live in a Christian world and we have to speak their language ... When I use the word 'Satan' it means the natural order, the will of a man, the will to grow, the will to become the superman and not to be oppressed by any law such as the church, which is only a way to control the masses."<ref name="shaman1">{{cite web |url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/gorgoroth.html |title=Gorgoroth interview @ |publisher=Tartareandesire.com |date=2004-10-07 |access-date=2015-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214650/http://www.tartareandesire.com/interviews/gorgoroth.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Gaahl and Infernus were openly supportive of the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene#Church arsons and attempts|church burnings]] perpetrated by members of the black metal scene in the early 1990s. Gaahl further said, "there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them".<ref name="headbanger"/>
