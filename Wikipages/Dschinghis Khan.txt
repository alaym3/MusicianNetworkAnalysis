In 2018, there have been two groups with the name: the one led by original members [[Henriette Strobel]] and [[Edina Pop]], and a more current group led by original member [[Wolfgang Heichel]] and [[Stefan Track]], who replaced the late [[Louis Potgieter]] in the 2005 reunion concert.

== Career ==
===Beginning: 1970s–80s===
The band was formed and managed by German producer [[Ralph Siegel]]. Their original eponymous song was written and produced by Ralph Siegel with lyrics by [[Bernd Meinunger]] and came in fourth place at the [[1979 Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Their name is the German spelling of the name of the historical figure [[Genghis Khan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]].

The only native [[German people|Germans]] in the group were the bald-headed Karl-Heinz "Steve" Bender, and Wolfgang Heichel, who brought his [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-born wife Henriette ({{nee}} Strobel) with him. Louis Hendrik Potgieter (Genghis Khan) was [[South African people |South African]].  Edina Pop (Marika Késmárky) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] who had started her singing career in West Germany in 1969. [[Leslie Mándoki]], also Hungarian, had left Hungary in 1975.

In 1979, the band released the singles "Dschinghis-Khan"<ref>{{Citation | title = Dschinghis khan | work = Rate your music | url = http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/dschinghis-khan}}.</ref> and "[[Moskau (song)|Moskau]]". In 1980, its English-language version topped the charts in Australia for six weeks,<ref name= "HS-hits">{{cite web |title=The biggest hits that never made No. 1 in Australia|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRTL9Pw4ltI |work=[[Herald Sun]]|access-date= 1 January 2014|date=2 January 2014}}</ref> largely thanks to [[Seven Network]] using the song as the theme music for coverage of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]].

In an interview with Russian television presenter Alexandra Glotova, the producer of the group Dschinghis Khan, Heinz Gross, said that in the 1980s, the band was banned in the Soviet Union and was accused of anti-communism and nationalism.<ref>{{YouTube|3g2ZTLJiKSA|Interview of the band Dschinghis Khan to Russian national channel TV Center}}</ref>
[[File:Dschinghis Khan 1.jpg|thumb|Henriette Strobel, Wolfgang Heichel and Edina Pop performing in 2009]]
The group broke up in 1984 but 1986 saw a brief reunion as Dschinghis Khan Family. Only Henriette Heichel (vocals), [[Leslie Mándoki]] (drums) and Louis Potgieter (keyboards) returned from the original lineup. The song "Wir gehör'n zusammen" led them to a national qualifying round of the [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986|Eurovision Song Contest]], where they finished in second place.

===Continued career: 1990s–present===
Dancer and front man Louis Potgieter died of [[AIDS]] in 1994,<ref name = hist>{{Cite web|url= http://www.dschinghis-khan.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=28&limit=1&limitstart=2&lang=en|title= History |website=Dschinghis Khan |access-date= 2017-11-26}}</ref> while singer Karl-Heinz "Steve" Bender died of [[cancer]] in 2006.<ref name = hist /> 

The song "Wie Feuer im Wind" on the group's album "7 Leben" in 2007 is dedicated to both Potgieter and Bender as a tribute to the two members.<ref>https://img.discogs.com/28Dasi6MX2Q92u-E2YyGXiqIqyk=/fit-in/600x597/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/R-3389664-1328518688.jpeg.jpg</ref>

The success of the band eventually led to Wolfgang and Henriette's divorce, with Henriette reverting to her maiden name of Strobel.<ref>{{YouTube|GQWXi8g5hJc|Dschinghis Khan Interview with English Subtitles (Part 1)}}</ref>

In 2005, the band members Wolfgang Heichel, Steve Bender, Henriette Strobel and Edina Pop started a "comeback" with a show at the Retro FM festival in the Olympic stadium in [[Moscow]]. Stefan Track came as new member to the band to replace Louis Hendrik Potgieter.

In 2018, they re-recorded their song "Moskau" with producer [[Ralph Siegel]] and singers [[Jay Khan]], [[Alexander Malinin]] and [[Ustinya Malinin]], Jorge Jiménez & Marifer Medrano for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>[https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article176981287/Dschinghis-Khan-Co-Wenn-die-WM-wird-wie-die-WM-Songs-dann-gute-Nacht.html Welt.de]</ref> In April 2018, original member Wolfgang Heichel and Stefan Track, fresh off his spin-off ''Rocking Son of Dschinghis Khan'' formed a new Dschinghis Khan after Heichel gained the rights to the name in Germany and Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/3020172144846/DE |title=Deutsches Patent und Markenamt |date=2017-08-05|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> Henriette Strobel, Edina Pop, Claus Kupreit, and producer Heinz Gross also own the rights to the name Dschinghis Khan,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/3020180088372/DE |title=Deutsches Patent und Markenamt |date=2018-05-04|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> with both group patents revealing the use of a certain logo. Therefore, there are two disco groups with the name Dschinghis Khan.

On 12 September 2020, dancer and singer Johannes Kupreit died in a car accident in Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Traueranzeigen von Johannes Kupreit {{!}} trauer.merkur.de|url=https://trauer.merkur.de/traueranzeige/johannes-kupreit|access-date=2021-03-14|website=trauer.merkur.de|language=de-DE}}</ref> Tributes were paid from the members and Dschinghis Khan fans from around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Login • Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFNrdKKlA9U/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-14|website=www.instagram.com}}</ref> New member Ohla Khan eventually replaced Kupreit after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Login • Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/ohlakhan_official/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-14|website=www.instagram.com}}</ref>
