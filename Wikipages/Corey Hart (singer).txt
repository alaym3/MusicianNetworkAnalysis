He has sold over 16 million records worldwide and recorded nine US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 40 hits. In Canada, 30 of Hart's recordings have been Top 40 hits, including 11 in the Top 10, over the course of over 35 years in the music industry. Nominated for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1984, Hart is an inductee of both Canada's Music Hall of Fame and Canada's Walk of Fame, and is also a multiple Juno award nominee and winner, including the Diamond Award for his best-selling album ''[[Boy in the Box (album)|Boy in the Box]]''.<ref name="canadaswalkoffame.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/|title=Canada's Walk of Fame|website=Canada's Walk of Fame}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1985/grammys.htm |title=27th Annual Grammy Awards – 1985 |publisher=Rock on the Net |date=February 26, 1985 |access-date=June 30, 2014}}</ref> He has also been honoured by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/corey-hart |title=Hart, Corey – The Canadian Encyclopedia |date=August 26, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826165440/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0001559 |archive-date=August 26, 2011 }}</ref>

== Early life ==
Hart was born on May 31, 1962, in [[Montreal]], Quebec, the youngest of five children of Mina (née Weber) and Robert Hart, both Montreal natives. His paternal grandfather was a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant, while Corey's mother was from a Romanian Jewish family.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coeur Montréalais, Citoyen du Monde |trans-title=Montreal Heart, citizen of the world |language=fr |url=http://lequebecunehistoiredefamille.com/sites/default/files/famillehart2.pdf |website=Lequebecunehistoiredefamille.com|date=October 4, 2020 }}</ref> Hart's parents separated when he was 10 years old. Hart then returned to Montreal to live with his mother and older brother Robbie. He shared an especially close relationship with his mother, to whom Hart's first album was dedicated.<ref name="First Offense, liner notes, 1981">''First Offense'', liner notes, 1983.</ref> Hart had little contact with his father, and this is reflected in some of his compositions, such as the 1998 song "Reconcile".<ref>[https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/corey-hart-haunted-by-the-father-who-bailed-out-on-him "Corey Hart haunted by the father who 'bailed out' on him"]. Brendan Kelly, ''Montreal Gazette'', June 14, 2019</ref>

Hart's first experience as a performing artist came at age 11, when he sang "[[Ben (song)|Ben]]" for Tom Jones in Miami. He also recorded songs with Paul Anka in Las Vegas during this time period. In 1980, Hart represented Canada in the [[World Popular Song Festival]] in Tokyo (along with singer [[Dan Hill]]), marking his first public performance of original material.  Back in Canada, Hart reached out to [[Billy Joel]] who was on tour in the Montreal area at the time. Joel's backup band contacted him and Hart ended up recording several demos with them in [[Long Island, New York]]. Hart worked with several other Canadian studio musicians on demos before finally signing to the [[Aquarius Records (Canada)|Aquarius Records]] label in 1982 at the age of 20. Several songs on his first album, including "The World Is Fire", reflect the rejections and difficulties Hart encountered along the path to getting a recording contract.<ref name="''Phoenix Gazette'', Oct. 3, 1984">''Phoenix Gazette'', October 3, 1984.</ref>

== Recording career ==

=== "Sunglasses at Night" and ''First Offense'' ===
Hart's debut album, ''[[First Offense]]'', was recorded at Revolution Recording Studios in [[Manchester, England|Manchester]], England in the spring of 1982. It was produced by [[Jon Astley]], then best known for his work with [[The Who]], and Phil Chapman. Released in 1983, ''First Offense'' featured the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 10 hit song "Sunglasses at Night" (No.&nbsp;7<ref name=hot100 />) and Top 20 follow-up single "It Ain't Enough" (No.&nbsp;17<ref name=hot100 />). The album went platinum in the United States and quadruple platinum in Canada. ''First Offense'' initially received a modest response upon its Canadian release. It was only after garnering US success in the summer of 1984 that he became well known in his native Canada.

''First Offense'' also featured guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] on the record's closing track, "Jenny Fey".

<blockquote>Jon (Astley, producer) felt there was one song Eric Clapton would really like. So just out of the blue he sent him the song, and lo and behold Eric Clapton was on the phone saying he wanted to play on it and asking how I would mind if he did. I didn't. Eric was the classic gentleman. Here I was, this Canadian kid in England with big-time producers doing my first album and Clapton tells me, 'It's such a pretty song, so easy to play. The type of thing I'd write myself'.<ref name="''Georgia Straight'', May 4, 1984">''Georgia Straight'', May 4, 1984.</ref></blockquote>

The Juno-award-winning video for "[[Sunglasses at Night]]" (directed by Rob Quartly) which featured a futuristic, Orwellian society helped propel the popularity of the track.

Hart toured the United States and Canada extensively in 1984 and early 1985, first as a supporting act for [[Culture Club]], [[April Wine]], [[Thomas Dolby]], [[Hall & Oates]] and [[Rick Springfield]], then later as a headline performer. ''First Offense'' was nominated for Best Album of the Year at that year's [[ADISQ]] Awards in Hart's native Quebec, where the singer was also nominated for Best New Artist. ''First Offense'' won the ''Félix''.<ref name="ADISQ Archive">{{cite web|title=ADISQ Archive|url=http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/index.html|access-date=October 8, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212090250/http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/index.html|archive-date=February 12, 2013}}</ref>

=== "Never Surrender", ''Boy in the Box'' and ''Fields of Fire'' ===
Hart's second album was ''[[Boy in the Box (album)|Boy in the Box]]'', released in June 1985, which reached Diamond status in Canada (one million copies sold) by February 1986. It was the second album by a Canadian artist to do so.<ref name="Hart Hits Diamond Figure, Kirk LaPointe, ''Billboard'', Feb. 22, 1986, pp. 63-64.">Hart Hits Diamond Figure, Kirk LaPointe, ''Billboard'', February 22, 1986, pp. 63–64.</ref> The album featured the hit single "[[Never Surrender (Corey Hart song)|Never Surrender]]" which spent nine consecutive weeks at No.&nbsp;1 in Canada<ref>{{cite book|last=Lwin|first=Nanda|title=Top 40 hits: The Essential Chart Guide|year=1999|publisher=Music Data Canada|location=Mississauga, Ont.|isbn=1-896594-13-1|author-link=Nanda Lwin}}</ref> and peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the US Billboard Hot 100,<ref name=hot100 /> also earning Hart an ASCAP Award as one of the most played songs of 1985. "Never Surrender" was the No.&nbsp;2 song in the year-end Canadian charts in 1985, finishing second to the [[Northern Lights (Canadian band)|Northern Lights]] charity single "[[Tears Are Not Enough]]" in which Hart had also participated, alongside veteran Canadian artists [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Neil Young]], [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Bryan Adams]].<ref name="The $10 million national daydream">{{cite journal|author=Wilder Penfield II |author2=Bob Thompson|title=The $10&nbsp;million national daydream|journal=Graffiti|year=1985|volume=1|issue=5|pages=26–29}}</ref> Subsequent singles all charted in the Canadian and US Top 40 ("Boy in the Box", "Everything in My Heart" and "Eurasian Eyes"). In the US, ''Boy in the Box'' peaked at No.&nbsp;20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart<ref name=billboard200 /> and went platinum.

''Boy in the Box'' was nominated for a Juno Award as well as an [[ADISQ]] Award for Best Album, taking home a ''Félix'' for Hart in this category.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|journal=Canadian Composer|title=Boy in the Box|date=November 1985|issue=205|page=26}}</ref>  "Never Surrender" won the Juno for Best Selling Single of 1985.

In 1984 and 1985 Hart toured extensively in North America and Japan in support of ''Boy in the Box'': [[Exhibition Stadium]] in Toronto, the [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] in Tokyo, the [[Calgary]] [[Scotiabank Saddledome]] and the [[Montreal Forum|Forum]] in Montreal.<ref name="''Shades'' official fan club newsletter, Vol. 1 No.&nbsp;1, Fall 1984 and Vo1. 1 No.&nbsp;3, Summer 1985.">''Shades'' official fan club newsletter, Vol. 1 No.&nbsp;1, Fall 1984 and Vo1. 1 No.&nbsp;3, Summer 1985.</ref> He appeared frequently on ''[[Good Rockin' Tonite]]'' (Canada), ''[[Friday Night Videos]]'' and [[MTV]] (US), and ''Music Life'' (Japan), and toured Europe and Australasia.<ref name="''CBC News'', February 1985.">CBC News, February 1985.</ref>

''[[Fields of Fire (album)|Fields of Fire]]'', Hart's third album release, came out in fall 1986 and went double platinum in Canada and achieved gold status in the US. It featured the US Top 20 hit single "I Am By Your Side",<ref name=hot100 /> as well as the Canadian No.&nbsp;1 single "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]", originally performed by [[Elvis Presley]]. This was the first recorded cover version of a song Hart had released. The song was also a top 10 hit in the [[Philippines]] and Japan. Critics generally agreed that ''Fields of Fire'' displayed a new, more mature direction in Hart's songwriting.

{{quote|With his third album, this young Canadian exhibits a growing maturity...He's come a long way from singing about wearing 'Sunglasses at Night'.|''Boston Globe'', September 1986}}

''Fields of Fire'' earned Hart several nominations at the 1987 Juno Awards, in the categories of Best Male Vocalist of the Year, Best Album Graphics (done by Hart's partner Erika Gagnon), and Single of the Year for "Can't Help Falling in Love". The singer was also nominated for Best Male Artist and Album of the Year at that year's ADISQ Awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=ADISQ Awards, 1986|url=http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/gala1986.html|access-date=October 8, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102051915/http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/gala1986.html|archive-date=November 2, 2013}}</ref>

Once more Hart launched a world tour in support of the record. He performed sold-out concerts in Japan and made promotional appearances in Europe from fall 1986 through mid-1987. However, Hart's tour had to be halted prematurely in July 1987 after the then 25-year-old singer collapsed backstage from exhaustion after a concert in Canada. After nearly four years of constant touring and recording, he took some time off for rest and recuperation.<ref name="''Shades'' official fan club newsletter, Vo1. 3, Fall 1987.">''Shades'' official fan club newsletter, Vo1. 3, Fall 1987.</ref>

=== ''Young Man Running'', ''Bang!'' and ''Attitude and Virtue'' ===
[[File:Corey Hart (singer), 1990.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hart in 1990]]
Hart returned to songwriting, leading to the singer's fourth album release, ''[[Young Man Running]]''. Featuring the US Top 40 hit<ref name=hot100 /> "In Your Soul" (which reached No.&nbsp;2 in Canada),<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=8755& "Canadian Content (Cancon)"]. ''RPM'' – Volume 48, No. August 17, 13, 1988</ref> The album included experienced backing musicians, in particular [[Ruby Turner]], and was largely produced by Hart himself.

Photographer [[Herb Ritts]] shot the cover and other photographs for the album. The video for "In Your Soul" featured location footage in [[New Mexico]] and [[Moab, Utah]] and was directed by [[Meiert Avis]] ([[U2]], [[Bruce Springsteen]]).

Hart touring extensively in Japan and the [[Philippines]] in 1988, as well as in Canada's East Coast and Quebec where he  spoke mostly in French.<ref name="''Hart-Line'' official fan club newsletter, Vol. 1 No.&nbsp;2, 1989.">''Hart-Line'' official fan club newsletter, Vol. 1 No.&nbsp;2, 1989.</ref> Hart again sold out the Tokyo Nippon Budokan as well as arenas in other Japanese cities and the Ultra, a 13,000 seat venue outside [[Manila]].<ref name="Manila ''Bulletin'', Dec. 30, 1988.">Manila ''Bulletin'', December 30, 1988.</ref>  ''[[Young Man Running]]'' received an ADISQ nomination for Album of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|title=ADISQ Awards, 1988|url=http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/gala1988.html|access-date=October 8, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604004606/http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/gala1988.html|archive-date=June 4, 2012}}</ref>

In early 1989 Hart returned to songwriting in preparation for what would be his final album with EMI America, ''[[Bang! (Corey Hart album)|Bang!]]''.  Recorded in Los Angeles, the release debuted in early 1990 to positive reviews and airplay on MTV. ''Bang!'' shipped platinum in Canada and hit the Japanese Top 20 two weeks into its release. The first single, "A Little Love", hit the US Top 40 in early 1990 and featured another video by Meiert Avis. ''Bang!'' also reunited Hart with Ruby Turner and featured drummer [[Kenny Aronoff]] ([[John Cougar Mellencamp]]) on drums and percussion.

Despite the success of the first single (a Top 10 hit in Canada), ''Bang!'' was less successful than previous albums in the US;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wQcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 "Hart ends Hiatus by Baring His Soul"]. ''Billboard'', August 17, 1996, page 53, by Larry LeBlanc</ref> EMI also failed to nominate Hart for any Juno Award categories that year. Hart was released from his contract with the company in August 1990.<ref name="ReferenceB">Hart-Line Official Fan Club newsletter, vol. 2, no. 4, fall 1990.</ref> EMI later released a collection of Hart's singles on a compilation album, ''[[Singles (Corey Hart album)|Singles]]'' in 1991. Hart did secure a nomination for Best Male Artist at the 1990 ADISQ awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=ADISQ Awards, 1990|url=http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/gala1990.html|access-date=October 8, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102200845/http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/gala1990.html|archive-date=November 2, 2013}}</ref>

[[Sire Records]] co-founder [[Seymour Stein]] approached Hart at this juncture and eventually signed him to Sire shortly thereafter. What followed was Hart's sole album for the label, ''[[Attitude & Virtue]]''. Released in 1992, it appeared on the Top 40 in Canada, and featured several guest musicians including [[Jane Siberry]], [[Duff McKagan]] of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Terence Trent D'Arby]] and the return of Ruby Turner. Three singles were released from the album: "Baby When I Call Your Name" (released in Canada and the  United States), "92 Days of Rain" (released in Canada) and "Always" (released in Canada and the United States). All three singles charted in the Canadian Top 40. "Baby When I Call Your Name" and "92 Days of Rain" were accompanied by videos, the latter helmed by Hart's first director, Rob Quartly. The first song on the album, "Back in the Hand", summed up the prior decade in a celebration of feeling back in control of his musical career.

Hart received Hart a Juno nomination for 1992 Best Male Vocalist of the Year. He then took a break from writing and touring ("[[Jane Hawtin]] Live", 1997). He released one single, a cover of [[Edith Piaf]]'s "Hymn to Love", in 1994.

[[File:Family of Corey Hart (singer), 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Hart family, 2007]]

=== Julie Masse, ''Corey Hart'', Celine Dion and ''Jade'' ===
Hart presented an award at the [[Juno Awards of 1993]] in Toronto with [[Julie Masse]], a fellow nominee with two platinum selling albums in Quebec, ''Julie Masse'' and ''À Contre Jour''. Upon seeing them together, Masse's manager suggested that Hart work with her on a new English language album. Hart co-produced and wrote five songs for Masse's gold-selling ''Circle of One'', which was released in Canada in 1994 and marked the first time Hart had written and produced songs for an artist other than himself. This also led to their relationship as husband and wife and parents to four children.<ref name="''Dernier heure (Quebec)'', Jan. 17, 1998.">''Dernier heure (Quebec)'', January 17, 1998.</ref> Hart was previously married to photographer/graphic designer Erika Gagnon from 1990 to 1994, and Masse to cinematographer Sylvain Brault from 1993 to 1994.

Following his work with Masse, Hart signed a new contract with Sony Music Canada and in 1996 released an eponymous CD [[Corey Hart (album)|''Corey Hart'']]. The album was co-produced by [[Humberto Gatica]] and contained some of Hart's most introspective work, spurred by his personal life changes. Sparked by the success of "Black Cloud Rain" which reached No.&nbsp;2 on the Canadian Top 40, ''Corey Hart'' went platinum in Canada. The video for "Black Cloud Rain" was directed by Javier Aguilera, a young Mexican filmmaker. He toured across the country for the first time since the cancelled 1987 ''Fields of Fire'' tour, and subsequent singles from the album ("Tell Me", "Third of June" and "Someone") all reached the Canadian Top 40. ''Corey Hart'' also earned Hart more award nominations, including Juno nods for Best Male Vocalist of the Year and Best Producer for "Black Cloud Rain" and "Simplicity", a non-single album track, and Best Anglophone Quebec Artist at the ADISQ Awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=ADISQ Awards, 1997|url=http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/gala1997.html|access-date=October 8, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221137/http://www.adisq.com/even-gala/archives/gala1997.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref>

In 1997, fellow Canadian [[Celine Dion]] released her ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' album, which featured the theme from the film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', "[[My Heart Will Go On]]". Also on the album were two songs written and co-produced by Hart: the Canadian Top 40 hit "[[Miles to Go (Before I Sleep)]]" and "Where Is the Love". As documented in Dion's concert DVD ''[[Au cœur du stade (video)|Au cœur du stade]]'', Dion's team reached out to Hart based on the recent success of ''Corey Hart'' in Canada and asked if he would write and produce for the songstress. He was also nominated for the Juno Award for Best Producer for the Dion tracks. Later in 1999 Hart performed live in the US for the first time since the late 1980s as Dion's guest in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and [[Ft. Lauderdale, Florida]].<ref name="''Billboard'', Oct. 30, 1999.">''Billboard'', October 30, 1999.</ref> Hart collaborated with Dion again on "Prayer", from her 2002 CD ''[[A New Day Has Come]]''.

In 1998, Hart released a second album on Sony, ''[[Jade (Corey Hart album)|Jade]]'', featuring a duet with partner Masse on the [[Jean-Jacques Goldman]] song "[[Là-bas (song)|Là-bas]]". The lead-off single "So Visible (Easy to Miss)" and follow-up release "Break the Chain" both charted in the Canadian Top 40, the singer gained yet another Juno Award nomination (for Best Male Vocalist of the Year) and Hart once again toured Canada in support of the album.  After enjoying a comeback in Canada in the late 1990s, Hart again came to a personal crossroads.

<blockquote>All I had ever wanted or known since I was a boy was to be creating music. But I couldn't continue to record or tour if I aspired to be a 24/7 father to our children. The two worlds simply collide.<ref name="Corey Hart: The boy leaves the box to be a good dad, Brendan Kelly, ''Montreal Gazette'', May 27, 2011.">Corey Hart: The boy leaves the box to be a good dad, Brendan Kelly, ''The Gazette'' (Montreal), May 27, 2011.</ref></blockquote>

At the end of the millennium, Hart once again fell largely silent as he and Masse married and relocated to [[Nassau, Bahamas]], to focus on raising their young family.<ref name="Columbia's Corey Hart Paints His Pop with a Shade of Jade, Larry Flick, ''Billboard'', Nov. 7, 1998.">Columbia's Corey Hart Paints His Pop with a Shade of Jade, Larry Flick, ''Billboard'', November 7, 1998</ref> He returned to Montreal in late 2002 for a two-night stand of concerts with the [[Montreal Symphony Orchestra]], performing songs from ''Corey Hart'' and ''[[Jade (Corey Hart album)|Jade]]'' as well as older hits to the accompaniment of the MSO.<ref name="http://articles.cnn.com/2002-08-13/entertainment/people.watn.hart_1_new-album-pop-stardom-corey-hart?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ">'80s heartthrob Corey Hart making music, being a dad.

== New directions ==

=== Siena Records and ''Walk in Beauty'' ===

In 2002, [[Seymour Stein]] of [[Sire Records]] reconnected with Hart. Stein offered Hart a boutique label with Sire/Warner Music Canada, Siena Records. The label, formed in 2003, went through several years of development while Hart pursued a suitable debut artist. He collaborated sporadically on individual songs with French-Canadian artists [[Garou (singer)|Garou]] and [[Wilfred Le Bouthillier]] in the mid-2000s, and performed with others including Meggie Lagacé on Quebec television.<ref name="''Star Systeme'' (Quebec), 2006">''Star Systeme'' (Quebec), 2006.</ref> After an associate sent Hart a demo MP3 by little-known performer Marie-Christine Depestre, the singer, a Montreal native of Haitian descent, became Siena's first official signing.<ref name="Kelly">{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Brendan|title=Working with Hart, singing with soul|url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=d470dd72-1d2b-4ab4-9604-bcdd15898a51|access-date=October 8, 2012|newspaper=The Gazette|location=Montreal|date=May 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202112042/http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=d470dd72-1d2b-4ab4-9604-bcdd15898a51|archive-date=February 2, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In May 2011, Marie-Christine released her debut CD, ''Walk in Beauty'', in Canada on Hart's label. Hart executive produced the album and wrote the bulk of the CD's songs<ref name="Corey Hart Loans 'Sunglasses at Night' to Protégé, Calls in Stevie Wonder Cameo, Lonny Knapp, ''Spinner'', June 9, 2011.">Corey Hart Loans 'Sunglasses at Night' to Protégé, Calls in Stevie Wonder Cameo, Lonny Knapp, ''Spinner'', June 9, 2011.</ref> ''Walk in Beauty'' features a cameo performance by music legend [[Stevie Wonder]] on the cover track "Keep on Runnin'" as well as a modern reworking of Hart's "Sunglasses at Night", reworked as "Girl in Shades" for Marie-Christine. Hart had refrained from granting [[Interpolation (popular music)|interpolation]] rights to the song for over 25 years, despite requests by [[Sean P. Diddy Combs]] and [[Nelly Furtado]].<ref name="Corey Hart merges from musical hibernation to launch Marie-Christine, Nick Patch, ''Canadian Press'', May 28, 2011.">Corey Hart merges from musical hibernation to launch Marie-Christine, Nick Patch, The Canadian Press, May 28, 2011.</ref> The CD also featured original compositions by Marie-Christine and its debut single, "Totally Random", became a hit in her native Quebec during the summer of 2011.  To mark the launch, she and Hart engaged the media on a short promotional tour of major Canadian markets in May 2011. A second single, "Silence", was released in January 2012 to Canadian radio and a third single from the album, "Port Au Prince", debuted in May 2012.

=== 2011 relaunch ===

In 2012, Hart's 30th year in the music industry, he collaborated with Canadian DJ 1Love on a remix of the song "Truth Will Set You Free" from ''Young Man Running.'' The single, "Truth Will Set U Free", was released globally to radio, and on Hart's website in June 2012 via Siena Records/Warner Music Canada.<ref name="Kingston (Ontario) Whig-Standard, May 31, 2012.">{{cite web |author=nurun.com |url=http://www.thewhig.com/2012/05/30/djs-dream-comes-true |title=DJ's dream comes true &#124; The Kingston Whig-Standard |website=Thewhig.com |access-date=June 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006104026/http://www.thewhig.com/2012/05/30/djs-dream-comes-true |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The song was Hart's first U.S. single in 20 years and Hart reunited with Meiert Avis for the video.

== In media ==
Hart was briefly considered for the role of [[Marty McFly]] in the 1985 film ''[[Back to the Future]]''. Producer [[Steven Spielberg]] sent Hart a copy of the script with an invitation for a screen test – a flattered Hart declined, preferring to focus on music instead of acting.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/strombo/videos.html?id=1954614834 Interview with George Stromboulopoulos], Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, May 27, 2011.</ref> Fellow Canadian [[Michael J. Fox]] eventually starred in the hit film.

During the mid-1980s, Hart was approached to record several songs for films. He mostly declined, preferring to write and record his own material; however, he did record the song "Hold On", written for the soundtrack to 1987's ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''. Hart's 1985 single, "Eurasian Eyes" (from ''Boy in the Box''), was featured in the film ''[[9½ Weeks]]'' and the final track from ''Fields of Fire'', "Blind Faith", was featured in the January 16, 1987 episode of ''[[Miami Vice]]'' titled "Down for the Count, Pt. 2".

In 2002, "Sunglasses at Night" was featured in the award-winning video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' for the Sony [[PlayStation 2]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beaumont |first1=Mark |title=Seven Songs You Only Know And Love If You Played Grand Theft Auto: Vice City |url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/seven-songs-you-only-know-and-love-if-you-played-grand-theft-auto-vice-city-7558 |website=NME.com |publisher=NME |access-date=7 November 2021 |date=2016}}</ref> The song title is also a clue to the mystery in Lior Samson's debut novel, ''Bashert''.

Hart's hit single "Sunglasses at Night" was featured on the American horror/comedy show ''[[Scream Queens (2015 TV series)|Scream Queens]]'' in 2015 and on the Netflix series ''[[Stranger Things]]'' in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.blog.austin360.com/2016/07/28/netflix-says-strangers-things-soundtrack-is-coming-to-our-ears-soon/|title=Netflix says 'Stranger Things' soundtrack is coming to our ears soon – Buzzworthy|first=Danielle|last=Lopez}}</ref> The song was also featured in a Gucci TV ad in 2017 and in the virtual showing of Balenciaga's SS 2021 collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQZekT-LFEk|title=Balenciaga Spring/Summer 2021|website=youtube.com}}</ref> In 2019, "[[Never Surrender (Corey Hart song)|Never Surrender]]" was featured in Episode One, Season Three of ''[[Stranger Things (season 3)|Stranger Things]].''
