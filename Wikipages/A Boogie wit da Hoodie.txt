Growing up, Dubose frequently got into legal trouble, mainly for selling [[cannabis]] and narcotics.<ref name=":0" /> After finding out what he was doing, Dubose's parents sent him to Florida as punishment. He graduated from high school at the Performance-based Preparatory Academy in [[Fort Pierce, Florida]].<ref name="XXL">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2016/06/a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-interview-the-break/|title=The Break Presents: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=June 17, 2016|access-date=January 2, 2017}}</ref> In Florida, Dubose was kept under house arrest. During this confinement, he began to work on his artistry, starting off by tweaking his self-composed rhymes and gradually leading one thing to another. He even built an amateur studio inside the flat that he lived in.

{{relevance inline|date=September 2021}}

Dubose's official discography began with the single "Temporary", which he released on [[SoundCloud]]. He was just nineteen at the time of its release. The song lacked good rhythm and flow which is usually required for a good hip-hop number. Myster Whyte, who he met in Florida and the producer of the song hired a trainer and asked A Boogie to work with his trainer until he gets his techniques right, he showed him the inside of his first professional studio. He said "I used to record songs like, play the beat from one phone and have another phone recording me and just rap, moving from that to a studio was like, 'Damn, I never knew I could sound like this'. It was just magic". The training sessions with Myster helped progress his sound, similar to the way that spending time in a gym will make you stronger.

In 2015, Dubose moved back to New York in an attempt to start making hip-hop his full-time career. He, [[Don Q (rapper)|Don Q]], Quincy "QP" Acheampong and Bubba then created Highbridge the Label and set up a home studio.<ref>{{Citation|last=XXL|title=A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie Talks Highbridge the Label, New EP and More|date=September 13, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOMzGchwT8|access-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> A Boogie released his first full-length project, a [[mixtape]] titled ''Artist'', in February 2016, which launched his career and was on ''[[Forbes]]'' list of up-and-coming rappers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/livbuli/2016/10/11/a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-starts-to-dominate-charts/#2e0ae8038792|title=Up-And-Coming Rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie Starts To Dominate Charts|last=Buli|first=Liv|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=November 30, 2016}}</ref> The mixtape was recorded during a time where Dubose was dealing with a difficult break-up which helped influence the mixtape and Dubose's future sound all together.<ref name=":0" />
