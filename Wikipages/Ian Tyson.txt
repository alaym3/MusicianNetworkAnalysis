'''Ian Dawson Tyson''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|CM|AOE}} (born 25 September 1933) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, best known for having written the songs "[[Four Strong Winds]]" and "[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]", performed with partner [[Sylvia Tyson]] as the duo [[Ian & Sylvia]].

==Early life and education==
Tyson was born to British immigrants in Victoria, and grew up in Duncan B.C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alternativetrends.com/fall-winter-2010/features/ian-tyson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707120514/http://alternativetrends.com/fall-winter-2010/features/ian-tyson |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 July 2011 |title=Ian Tyson: The many faces of a Canadian icon |publisher=Alternativetrends.com |access-date=5 March 2011 |first=Kolya |last=Witko |date=Fall–Winter 2009 }}</ref> A rodeo rider in his late teens and early twenties, he took up the guitar while recovering from an injury he sustained in a fall. He has named fellow Canadian country artist [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]] as a musical influence.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eQkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PT77#v=onepage&q=&f=false "Ian's 1st Solo Album Marks Return To Country Roots"], Billboard, 23 November 1974, p.66</ref> He made his singing debut at the Heidelberg Café in [[Vancouver]] in 1956 and played with a [[rock and roll]] band, The Sensational Stripes. He graduated from the [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design|Vancouver School of Art]] in 1958.

==Career==
After graduation, Tyson moved to [[Toronto]] where he began a job as a commercial artist. There he performed in local clubs and in 1959 began to sing on occasion with [[Sylvia Tyson|Sylvia Fricker]]. By early 1959 Tyson and Fricker were performing part-time at the Village Corner as [[Ian & Sylvia]]. The pair became a full-time musical act in 1961 and married three years later. In 1969, they formed and fronted the group [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|The Great Speckled Bird]]. Residing in southern [[Alberta]], the Tysons toured all over the world. During their years together, the pair released 13 albums of folk and country music.<ref name="Inc.2000">{{cite book|first=Larry|last=LeBlanc|title=Tyson album, stage show, draw on her life and long career in music|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aREEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|date=9 September 2000|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=60–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

From 1970 to 1975, Tyson hosted a national television program, ''The Ian Tyson Show'', on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], known as ''Nashville North'' in its first season. Sylvia Tyson and the Great Speckled Bird appeared often on the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/17889/ian_tyson_show,_the/details/ | title=Ian Tyson Show, The (Series) (1970–1975) |date=February 2003 | access-date=18 July 2019 | publisher=TV Archive}}</ref>

In 1980, Tyson became associated with Calgary music manager and producer [[Neil MacGonigill]]. Tyson decided to concentrate on [[country music|country]] and [[cowboy music]], resulting in the well-received 1983 album ''Old Corrals and Sagebrush'',<ref>[[Heath McCoy]], [http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=243398d1-ce40-4624-a9ea-e9bfdb598778&sponsor= Field of dreamers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622043655/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=243398d1-ce40-4624-a9ea-e9bfdb598778&sponsor= |date=22 June 2015 }}.  ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' via [[Canada.com]], 19 June 2007.  Retrieved 3 April 2015.</ref> released on [[Columbia Records]].

In 1989, Tyson was inducted into the [[Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame]].

In 2005, [[CBC Radio One]] listeners chose his song "[[Four Strong Winds]]" as the greatest Canadian song of all time on the series ''[[50 Tracks: The Canadian Version]]''. There was strong momentum for him to be nominated the Greatest Canadian, but he fell short. He has been a strong influence on many Canadian artists, including [[Neil Young]], who recorded "Four Strong Winds" for ''[[Comes a Time]]'' (1978).  [[Johnny Cash]] would also record the same song for ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]'' (2006). [[Judy Collins]] recorded a version of his song "[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]" in 1968.

[[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Band]] recorded his song "One Single River" in Woodstock, New York, in 1967. The recording can be found on the unreleased [[List of Basement Tapes songs|Genuine Basement Tapes]], vol. I.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions 1960–1994 |last=Heylin |first=Clinton |isbn=978-0312150679 |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |page=55 |url=http://www.clinton-heylin.com/Bob%20Dylan%20Recording.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121032101/http://www.clinton-heylin.com/Bob%20Dylan%20Recording.htm |archive-date=21 January 2012 }}</ref>

In 2006, Tyson sustained irreversible scarring to his vocal cords as a result of a concert at the [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] followed a year later by a virus contracted during a flight to [[Denver]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ian-tysons-brave-new-cd |title= Ian Tyson's Brave New CD|magazine= Macleans|access-date= 5 March 2011|date= 1 December 2008}}</ref> This resulted in a notable loss of the remarkable quality and range he was known for; he has self-described his new sound as "gravelly".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ian-tyson-emc/ |title= Ian Tyson|encyclopedia=Canadian Encyclopedia |access-date=5 March 2011 }}</ref> Notwithstanding, he released the album ''From Yellowhead to Yellowstone and Other Love Stories'' in 2008 to high critical praise. He was nominated for a 2009 Canadian Folk Music Awards for Solo Artist of the Year. The album includes a song about Canadian hockey broadcasting icon Don Cherry and the passing of his wife, Rose, a rare Tyson cover written by Toronto songwriter [[Jay Aymar]].

Sylvia joined Ian to sing their signature song, ''Four Strong Winds'', at the 50th anniversary of the [[Mariposa Folk Festival]] on 11 July 2010, in Orillia, Ontario.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/four-strong-winds-ian-sylvia-by-john-einarson-with-ian-tyson-and-sylvia-tyson/article4256234/|title=Four Strong Winds: Ian &amp; Sylvia by John Einarson with Ian Tyson and Sylvia Tyson|access-date=13 April 2021|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>

Tyson has also written a book of [[young adult fiction]] about his song "La Primera", called ''La Primera: The Story of Wild Mustangs''.<ref>{{cite book |title= La primera : the story of wild mustangs|last= Tyson|first= Ian|others= Paintings by Adeline Halvorson|year= 2009|publisher= [[Tundra Books]]|location= Toronto|isbn= 978-0-88776-863-7|oclc= 226999077}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Tyson has been married twice.  Both marriages ended in divorce.

His first marriage, to [[Sylvia Fricker]] Tyson, ended in an amicable<ref>Ian: "Silvia and I had parted, amicably, and I came out to Alberta..." in documentary {{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F44XXgLcdus | title=Songs from the Gravel Road | year=2010 | access-date=11 February 2012 | publisher=Bravo network }}</ref> divorce in 1975.

After the marriage to Sylvia ended in 1975, Ian returned to Southern Alberta to farm and train horses but also continued his musical career on a limited basis. In 1979, Neil Young recorded ''Four Strong Winds'', and Tyson used the royalties for a down payment on his own cattle and horse ranch; he started playing regularly at Calgary's Ranchman's Club. His next albums were cowboy music: ''I Outgrew the Wagon'' (1989), ''And Stood There Amazed'' (1991), and ''Eighteen Inches of Rain'' (1994).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1999/2/15/home-on-the-range|title=Home on the range &#124; Maclean's |date=February 15, 1999|first=Brian |last=Bergman |website=Macleans magazine archive |access-date=13 April 2021}}</ref>

A book by John Einarson, ''Four Strong Winds: Ian & Sylvia'', was published in 2012. A few years later, Ian said that Evinia Pulos (Bruce) was his soulmate; since she lived in [[Kelowna]], BC, he was not seeing her often. "We’ve been lovers for 55 years...How many people can say that?," Tyson said. In 2015, he had open heart surgery to replace a blocked aortic valve. In 2018, Tyson made concert appearances in British Columbia and Alberta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://50plusworld.com/cowboy-ian-tysons-four-strong-winds/|title=Cowboy Ian Tyson's Four Strong Winds ( written about Evinia)|first=Anita|last=Hamilton|website=50plusworld.com|access-date=13 April 2021}}</ref> His website indicated that in 2019, he was to make two concert appearances, one in Calgary and the other in Bragg Creek, Alberta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iantyson.com/pages/concertlistings.asp|title=The Legendary Ian Tyson Official Website|website=Iantyson.com|access-date=13 April 2021}}</ref>
