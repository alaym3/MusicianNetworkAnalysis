He was a major figure in the ''[[salsa romántica]]'' subgenre that was popular in the 1980s and early 1990s. During his youth, he developed a passion for [[Percussion section|percussion]], later confessing that this would have been his second choice after singing.<ref name="Ornelas37">{{Harvnb|Ornelas|2002|pp=37}}</ref> 
Fan reaction to his work was diverse. Within the [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] community, he was regarded as "one of the best salseros ever", and Puerto Ricans abroad were particularly fond of it because it brought back memories of their homeland.<ref name="TR"/> Among non-Latinos, some admitted that his music had been responsible for their interest in salsa as a genre and even the Spanish language.<ref name="TR"/>

As salsa moved closer to [[pop music]], and toned down the [[eroticism]] in its lyrics during the 1990s, Ruiz was challenged, along with other ''salsa romántica'' performers, but he managed to record a number of hits during his late career.<ref name="BG"/> He suffered from years of drug and alcohol abuse. His personal shortcomings were exploited by the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid media]] but had little impact on his popularity.<ref name="BG"/> In 1998, Ruiz died due to complications from [[Alcoholic liver disease|liver disease]].
