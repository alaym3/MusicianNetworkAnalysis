==History==
===Beginnings===
Palomo was born in [[Monterrey, Nuevo Leon|Monterrey]], Mexico, and later moved to [[San Antonio, Texas]] at the age of 5. He relocated to [[Denton, Texas]] for college at the [[University of North Texas]]. Palomo had already been writing and performing music before the inception of Neon Indian, in his projects Ghosthustler and VEGA, through much of his high school years.
Shortly before the release of ''[[Psychic Chasms]]'', Palomo said he planned on releasing another album as VEGA, although this did not happen.<ref>{{cite web |last=Weiss |first=Evan |url=http://www.theartssection.com/2009/09/music-neon-indian.html |title=Music: Neon Indian |publisher=The Arts Section |date=September 15, 2009 |access-date=October 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6B7IPJuwh?url=http://www.theartssection.com/2009/09/music-neon-indian.html |archive-date=October 2, 2012 }}</ref> In an interview, Palomo cites his father as a musical influence, "just because that's how he makes his living—he had a brief stint in the late 70s and early 80s as a Mexican pop star." Palomo also said that he sampled some of his father's material in his work with Neon Indian.<ref name="rising">{{cite web |last=Dombal |first=Ryan |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/36199-rising-neon-indian/ |title=Rising: Neon Indian |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=August 14, 2009 |access-date=July 15, 2013}}</ref>

The name Neon Indian was conceived by an ex-girlfriend of Palomo's, Alicia Scardetta, who was also the subject of their song "Should Have Taken Acid with You".<ref name="rising"/> The song was originally presented as a musical apology for a missed [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]] date. Her positive reaction to the song spurred Palomo to continue writing more songs as Neon Indian.<ref name="rising"/>

===2009–2010: ''Psychic Chasms''===
Neon Indian's debut album, ''Psychic Chasms'', was released on October 13, 2009 by Lefse Records.
