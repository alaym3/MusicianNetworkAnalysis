'''Mushroomhead''' is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. Formed in 1993 in the [[Cleveland Warehouse District]], the band is known for their [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] sound which includes influence from metal, [[art rock]] and [[electro-industrial]] and their imagery which features masks and costumes as well as their unique live shows usually performed at smaller venues.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://shutter16.com/wp/2011/05/25/feature-story-mushroomhead-hed-to-head-tour/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426061303/http://shutter16.com/wp/2011/05/25/feature-story-mushroomhead-hed-to-head-tour/ |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |title=Mushroomhead – Hed to Head Tour |last=Augustine |first=Dianna |editor=Jenny Lou Bement |work=Shutter16 |date=May 25, 2011 |access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref> 

Mushroomhead has sold over 2 million media units worldwide, and has released 8 full-length albums and 15 music videos. Over their lifetime, Mushroomhead has gone through many changes in band lineups, with drummer [[Steve Felton]] being the only consistent member. Currently, the group comprises 8 members.

==History==
=== Debut album, ''Superbuick'' and ''M3'' (1993–2000) ===
In 1993, Mushroomhead was established as a side project. To differentiate itself from the members' existing bands and to dispel any misconceptions about the group's sound and musical content, Mushroomhead used costumes, [[mask]]s, and [[pseudonyms]]. Mushroomhead played its first show in 1993. Days later, the octet found itself on stage alongside established metal band [[Gwar]]. "We played our first show on a Saturday" said the band's drummer, Skinny, in an article for Mushroomhead's official website.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} "Three days later, we got a call to play with Gwar at the Cleveland Agora in front of 2,000 people – our second show ever!".<ref name="FSOS">{{cite web|title=Mushroomhead|url=http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=5596813262|access-date=June 1, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027190154/http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=5596813262|archive-date=October 27, 2011}}</ref>

In 1995, Mushroomhead released a self-financed debut album, ''[[Mushroomhead (Album)|Mushroomhead]]'', with their own record label, Filthy Hands Co. (previously known as Shroomco Records and later on, MRH Records). For the members, Mushroomhead became a priority with their original bands breaking-up. Although the line-up saw many changes throughout the 1990s, the band stayed active, steadily releasing music and gaining followers. In 1996, they released ''[[Superbuick]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=second demo by mushroomhead call superbuick|url=http://portalternativo.com/banda/Mushroomhead/Superbuick|access-date=June 1, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211306/http://portalternativo.com/banda/Mushroomhead/Superbuick/|archive-date=October 24, 2012}}</ref> In 1999, Mushroomhead released ''[[M3 (Album)|M3]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=M3 would be the last EP by mushroomhead|url=http://portalternativo.com/banda/Mushroomhead/Superbuick|access-date=June 1, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211306/http://portalternativo.com/banda/Mushroomhead/Superbuick/|archive-date=October 24, 2012}}</ref> which was the final album self-financed and self-released by the band.

===''XX'' and ''XIII'' (2000–2005)===
In 2000, Mushroomhead acquired a record deal with independent label [[Eclipse Records]] and in 2001 the band released their first ever label-released album; a compilation  release titled ''[[XX (Mushroomhead album)|XX]]'', which contains remixed/remastered versions of select songs from the first three Mushroomhear albums. Later in the year, after quickly selling almost 40,000 copies in just 2–3 months,<ref>Verified through use of Nielsen Soundscan</ref> the band signed with major label [[Universal Records]] and the compilation was re-released internationally. The release of the album led Mushroomhead to major national and international tours including [[Ozzfest]] 2002; as well as television exposure via their first music video "[[Solitaire/Unraveling]]". Also in 2001, guitarist [[John Sekula|J.J. Righteous]] was replaced by one of the band's previous stage dancers & then current sampler, Marko Vukcevich. 2003 saw the release of ''[[XIII (Mushroomhead album)|XIII]]'', their first album with new material for Universal Records. The album produced the single "Sun Doesn't Rise" which was featured on ''MTV: [[Headbangers Ball]]'' and the [[Freddy vs. Jason (soundtrack)|''Freddy vs Jason'' soundtrack]]. Also featuring the hidden track "Crazy", a song originally by [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]. The album debuted at no. 40 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 charts and sold 400,000 copies worldwide.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite web|title=Mushroomhead Enters Billboard|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mushroomhead|chart=all}}|access-date=June 1, 2008}}</ref>

After an extensive world tour, vocalist [[Jason Popson|J Mann]] announced he was leaving the band in August 2004, citing exhaustion and to take care of his sick father. He was replaced by Three Quarters Dead singer, [[Waylon Reavis|Waylon]]. In August 2005, Mushroomhead self-released its first DVD on its own Filthy Hands label – "Volume 1". Produced, directed, shot, and edited by the band, Volume 1 covers the band's rise in the 2000s with live performances, music videos, and behind the scenes footage.

While on the road in 2005, Mushroomhead began the process of writing new material and recording a new album. In December 2005, Mushroomhead signed with [[Megaforce Records]], ensuring the new album's availability nationally and internationally. On June 6, 2006, Mushroomhead launched Mushroom Kombat – an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|flash]] feature as a part of the band's official website. The mini-game pits band members against each other in a [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]-style environment, with each member having a unique [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|fatality]].

In 2005, Bronson announced that he was leaving the band to further his studies. Rather than recruiting another guitarist, the band decided to let Gravy do all the guitar parts for their new album. Gravy had said, "it worked out really well, because Bronson wasn't a natural [guitar] player. Now that he's gone, I don't have to worry anymore that my riffs will be too difficult for him to play."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wiederhorn |first1=Jon |title=Fungus Among Us |journal=Guitar World |date=December 2006 |volume=27 |issue=12 |page=31 |access-date=23 August 2021}}</ref>

Mushroomhead headlined with [[Dope (band)|Dope]], [[Nocturne (band)|Nocturne]], and [[New Orleans]] locals [[Invain]] on the Music For Freedom Tour sponsored by [[Jägermeister]] at the [[House of Blues]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] on Tuesday, August 16, 2005. This show was one of the last big acts to play in New Orleans for a long time due to [[Hurricane Katrina]] striking New Orleans on August 29, 2005.

===''Savior Sorrow'' and ''Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children'' (2005–2012)===
''[[Savior Sorrow]]'' was released on September 19, 2006, and debuted at No.&nbsp;45 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts with sales exceeding 12,000.<ref name=Billboard /> The band's label stated that sales were closer to 25,000 with the inclusion of sales made while on tour.<ref name=Billboard /> As a result, [[SoundScan]] issued an apology the day following the release of sales data due to mistakes made in estimates.<ref name=Billboard /> The primary reason given was the lack of inclusion of sales from the [[Best Buy]] retailer chain. Sales of Savior Sorrow were roughly 26,000 and the chart entry place was closer to the No.&nbsp;30 spot than No.&nbsp;73. Savior Sorrow's chart position was later officially adjusted to No.&nbsp;50. "Simple Survival", the pre-released single to [[Savior Sorrow]], was placed at No.&nbsp;39 on the Billboard [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart one week after the release.<ref name=Billboard />  Also in 2006, Daniel Fox (Lil' Dan) joined the band as a touring drummer.

The band has performed three shows on the [[Mayhem Festival]] tour, filling in for [[Bullet for My Valentine]]. Live footage was compiled into the band's second DVD, titled "Volume 2". On December 29, 2007, Mushroomhead won Video of the Year 2007 on the MTV2 Headbanger's Ball for "12 Hundred" from the Savior Sorrow record. On September 17, 2008, it was announced that the band will release the "Volume 2" DVD on October 28 through Filthy Hands/Megaforce Records. The disc features two and a half hours of content, including live footage from the three-year Savior Sorrow tour, music videos including "12 Hundred", "Simple Survival", "Burn", the short video for "Tattoo", "Save Us" and "Embrace the Ending", video commentary and behind the scenes footage. To support the DVD, Mushroomhead hit the road with [[The Autumn Offering]], XFactor1, and Human Factors Lab from October 3 in Findlay, Ohio, until November 2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the tour, Mushroomhead returned to the studio to record their next album.

They released ''[[Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children (album)|Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children]]'' in September 2010. Within the first week of its release, it became the No.&nbsp;1 best selling metal album on [[iTunes]]. A new song, "Your Soul Is Mine," appeared on the ''[[Saw VI (soundtrack)|Saw VI Soundtrack]]''. On October 1, 2010, a music video for "Come On" debuted on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' on MTV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thirteam.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general&action=display&thread=21519 |title=Thirteam |publisher=Thirteam.proboards.com |access-date=March 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324062714/http://thirteam.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=general&action=display&thread=21519 |archive-date=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The video has since been barred from airing on MTV and other television outlets after being deemed too graphic by network [[censors]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Bloody-Disgusting.com |url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/music/1073/ |title=BD Music News – Mushroomhead Debut Video For 'Come On': Banned From TV |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |access-date=July 1, 2011}}</ref> On October 28, 2010, the band's founding guitarist, JJ Righteous, died of unknown reasons at the age of 41.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gunshyassassin.com/news/former-mushroomhead-guitarist-jj-righteous-dies/ |title=Former Mushroomhead Guitarist JJ Righteous Dies |publisher=Gun Shy Assassin |date=November 3, 2010 |access-date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819010919/http://gunshyassassin.com/news/former-mushroomhead-guitarist-jj-righteous-dies/ |archive-date=August 19, 2014 }}</ref>

In October 2010, following the death of ex bandmate JJ Righteous, J Mann appeared on stage with the band during their Halloween show, performing vocals for two songs alongside both Jeffrey Nothing and Waylon. Both he and Waylon made a point of announcing that there were no hard feelings between the two of them, and that they are in fact on good terms with each other. On October 5, 2010, the Professional Wrestling Promotion known as TNA ([[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]) (Now called "Impact Wrestling") used their hit single "Come On" as the theme song to promote a match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley, a confrontation that was 20 years in the making. The promotional video can be seen on the TNA Wrestling official YouTube Channel. It is said that a longtime fan of the band put that together for them.

In February 2012, it was announced that guitarist [[Dave Felton|Gravy]] and bassist [[Jack Kilcoyne|Pig Benis]] would be replaced by Tommy Church and Ryan Farrell respectively. In April 2012, Dave "Gravy" Felton stated publicly on his Facebook fan page that he was "kicked out of the band." In May 2012, Daniel "Lil Dan" Fox left Mushroomhead to work for another band. It was rumored that he is working as a drum technician for Marilyn Manson. On May 22, Dave Felton posted on his fan page an interview about his latest band. In the interview, he was asked about the Mushroomhead split. He said that he was kicked out via email and that it was the third time he had been told to leave. He said that he thought one of the reasons was because he did not have a party mentality (drinking and smoking) and that he thought it sometimes got in the way of band progress. The interview was on Uncensored Net Noise on the Msc Radio Network LLC. Drum tech Jeremiah Stratton (also known from [[Hed PE]]) had taken over Fox's percussion parts in the Hed 2 Head Tour 3. After the Hed 2 Head Tour ended, drum tech Elliot Mapes took over Fox's drum parts for live shows. People have jokingly called him "Tall E" in reference to Fox's nickname being "Lil Dan". On Thursday, August 16, 2012, Mushroomhead stated on their official Facebook fan page that former member Bronson would return on guitar for their 2012 "Old School Show".

===''The Righteous & the Butterfly'', return of J Mann and departure of Waylon Reavis and Jeffrey Nothing (2012–2019)===
In September 2012, Mushroomhead announced that they are currently in the studio working on new music via their Facebook fan page. It was said by Mushroomhead frontman Jeff Hatrix that former [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and current Painface vocalist Anders Colsefni is in the works to do a recording together in their upcoming studio sessions. The band entered their own Filthy Hands Studio in December 2012 to begin writing and recording their next studio album.

Their eighth album was the only one to showcase all three vocalists. Drummer Steve Felton described it as "very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will. This is the first record with Church on guitar and Farrell on bass, so having those new writers on board you never know where it's going to go. For the old school fans there's a lot of flavorful elements in it so they will definitely enjoy it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nataliezworld.com/2013/04/mushroomheads-skinny-talks-nothing-but.html |title=Mushroomhead's Skinny Talks Nothing But the New, New, New! |publisher=NataliezWorld |date=June 9, 2012 |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>

They are influenced by bands such as [[Mr. Bungle]], [[Faith No More]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Pantera]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], and [[KMFDM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mushroomheadxx.20megsfree.com/about.html |title=About Mushroomhead |publisher=Mushroomheadxx.20megsfree.com |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/mushroomheadofficial/info |title=Mushroomhead Official |publisher=Facebook.com |date=October 23, 1993 |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref> In a 2014 interview with music journalist Greg Prato, Jason Popson reflected on the band's musical influences, stating "When you're talking about a band with nine guys, you're talking about tons of influences. I know when we started the band, we were really into a lot of the stuff [[Mike Patton]] was doing - Faith No More or Mr. Bungle, things like that. But we also liked heavier bands like [[Meshuggah]], Pantera. Then there's electronic stuff. So it's really all over the map. It's everything from hard rock to punk rock to hip-hop to electronica. It's pretty vast."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/j-mann-of-mushroomhead|title=J-Mann of Mushroomhead : Songwriter Interviews|website=www.songfacts.com}}</ref>

===Image and visuals===
The members of Mushroomhead have identified themselves by wearing masks and by its distinct "X Face" logo – commonly worn on the masks of most members, as well as clothing and merchandise. The band originally adopted masks and stage names to not conflict with their original bands. The band's look has evolved over the years, featuring alterations to bring them up to date and freshen up the image for new albums and tours.
In January 2013, Mushroomhead Video Director, Maskmaker and Make-up artist Dave Henson Greathouse competed in [[Face Off (season 4)|season 4 of original SyFy series "Face Off"]], a special effects prosthetic makeup reality show competition.
<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bedfordtimesregister.com/news/article/4894926 |title=Mushroomhead sprouts new recording |publisher=Bedfordtimesregister.com |date=September 16, 2010 |access-date=July 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707222115/http://www.bedfordtimesregister.com/news/article/4894926 |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Another common visual trait that Mushroomhead is known for, are the use of [[water drum]]s, which are performed by all the percussionists in the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/who-were-those-masked-men-why-mushroomhead-6496832|title=Who Were Those Masked Men? Why, Mushroomhead|first=Jack|last=Gorman|date=January 21, 2015|website=Houston Press}}</ref>

===Relationship with Slipknot===

In the band's early days, the group repeatedly saw accusations of [[plagiarism]] due to sharing a similar distinct visual performance to Iowan metal band [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], but the Mushroomhead band members have heavily denied the claims of "ripping off" Slipknot and insist that they were instead the first to adopt the masked aesthetic.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moss |first1=Corey |title=Mushroomhead: We Had Masks Before Slipknot, OK? |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1452963/mushroomhead-we-had-masks-before-slipknot-ok/ |website=MTV.com |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=March 18, 2002}}</ref>

As a result of the comparisons, Mushroomhead has had an on-and-off rivalry with Slipknot since at least 1999. The feud erupted mostly among fans of both bands. Before signing Slipknot, [[Roadrunner Records]] was interested in signing Mushroomhead, but Mushroomhead passed on the deal.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} As of 2009, the drama has ended and both bands currently maintain a close friendship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=126950 |title= Mushroomhead Vocalist Says There is No More Beef With Slipknot |publisher=blabbermouth.net |date=September 14, 2009 |access-date=May 26, 2013}}</ref>

Following the death of Slipknot member [[Paul Gray (American musician)|Paul Gray]] in 2010, Mushroomhead posted on their official Myspace page:  "R.I.P. Paul Gray, This feud needs to end. Much Love and Respect to the guys in Slipknot".

In 2012, [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] singer [[Corey Taylor]] has stated that he never had a problem with the band, he only had a problem with the behavior of their fans due to a situation Slipknot faced when they played in Mushroomhead's home town in Cleveland, and said there was never a real feud between bands but the feud was between Mushroomhead fans and Slipknot fans. He stated that doing a tour with  Mushroomhead, Gwar, and [[Mudvayne]] "would be beautiful!".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=77732 |title=Slipknot and Mushroomhead Warming Up To Tour – in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/slipknot-and-mushroomhead-on-the-same-stage-corey-taylor-says-its-possible/ |title=Slipknot and Mushroomhead on the Same Stage? Corey Taylor Says It's Possible |publisher=Loudwire.com |access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref> The same year, Mushroomhead members joined Slipknot's [[Sid Wilson]] on stage in an impromptu performance during Wilson's DJ set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/slipknot-mushroomhead-members-perform-together-in-minnesota-video/ |title=Slipknot, Mushroomhead Members Perform Together In Minnesota (Video) |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=June 11, 2012 |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, singer [[Jeffrey Hatrix|Jeffrey "Nothing" Hatrix]] stated about the feud between the two bands: "Fans are very loyal to the bands they like. Members of both sides have said they are over it and that it was never really between the bands. Let's all move on".<ref name="MRH-JN-int 2014">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/mushroomhead Interview with Jeffrey Nothing], by Grande-Rock.com retrieved on August 31, 2014.</ref>
