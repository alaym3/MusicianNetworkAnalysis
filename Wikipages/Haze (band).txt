'''Haze''' are an English [[progressive rock]] band from [[Sheffield]], England, mainly active in England in the 1980s.<ref name="Gigs">{{cite web|url=http://chrisgabadon.demonweb.co.uk/turtle/gigs.html|title=Haze/World Turtle/Von Daniken Gig List|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426002320/http://chrisgabadon.demonweb.co.uk/turtle/gigs.html |archivedate=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

== History ==
Formed in 1978 by the brothers Chris McMahon (bass, keyboards and vocals), and Paul McMahon (guitar and vocals), they played their first concert at Stephen Hill Youth Club, Sheffield on 10 November that year.<ref name="Gigs" /> They had several drummers before the longest serving and most notable, Paul 'Chis' Chisnell, joined them at a concert at the White Lion, [[Huddersfield]], on 19 June 1983.<ref name="Gigs" />

The band's first full album, ''C'est La Vie'', was released on vinyl with a special concert at Sheffield's [[The Leadmill]] on 7 April 1984.<ref name=HM>{{cite web|title=Haze (UK)  C'est la Vie|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/album-groupe-Haze_(UK)-nom_album-C'est_la_Vie-l-en.html|accessdate=21 February 2013}}</ref>

Following a "final" sell-out gig at [[Sheffield University]] on the 10th anniversary of the band's founding, 29 May 1988, the trio split up,<ref name="Gigs" /> but reunited for a "one-off" concert to mark the 20th anniversary, on 31 May 1998 at The Boardwalk, Sheffield.<ref name="Gigs" /> They now play together on an occasional basis, and played two 30th anniversary gigs at The Peel, [[Kingston-upon-Thames]], [[London]] on 31 May, and at The Boardwalk on 1 June 2008,<ref name="Gigs" /> at which six new songs were performed.

Despite achieving no [[record chart|chart]] success, and never having a [[recording contract]] (they released their own albums, on their 'Gabadon' label), they attracted a considerable cult following, headlined at [[The Marquee]],<ref name="Gigs" />

In March 2013 the band released their first studio album in 26 years, called ''The Last Battle''. The album features the band in its classic line-up (Paul and Chris McMahon and Paul Chisnell) with the addition of Ceri Ashton (on whistle, flute, cello, viola and clarinet) and Catrin Ashton (on fiddle and flute). The band stated that this is the final recorded performance with their long time drummer Paul Chisnell. Since the release of the album Paul McMahon's son Danny McMahon has been playing drums with Haze.<ref name="facebook">{{cite web |title=Haze - About |url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/HazeUK/about/?ref=page_internal |website=Facebook |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref>
