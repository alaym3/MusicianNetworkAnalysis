== Early life ==
Kwiecinski was born and raised in [[Southfield, Michigan]], a suburb of Detroit. His cousin Wyatt Willard lived with him until he was 10 years old. In elementary school, Kwiecinski was first introduced to the alto sax as well as the piano. After growing up on big horn sounds of funk groups like [[The Meters]], Kwiecinski found himself gravitating towards that influence when he first began making his own music in college. He attended [[Birmingham Groves High School]] and then [[Michigan State University]] for several years before he dropped out to focus on a music career.<ref>Brian McCollum, [http://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2015/05/16/griz-movement-homecoming/27398963/ "Griz finds the funk in electronic music's future"], ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', May 19, 2015.</ref> It was also during his college years that he had become personally comfortable enough to openly identify as gay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-name-is-griz-and_us_5935d865e4b0c670a3ce6797|title=My Name is GRiZ and...|last=Kwiecinski|first=Grant|date=2017-06-06|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-06}}</ref> While at Michigan State he would frequently DJ parties at his friends' fraternity houses and play shows in the East Lansing area.

== Career ==
Kwiecinski created the All Good Records (formerly Liberated Music) label to promote his music, along with electro contemporaries Muzzy Bearr (who also plays guitar live with GRiZ and on several tracks), The Floozies, The Geek x VRV, and Manic Focus. All Good Records describes itself as a label that "reps old school motown soul, future funk, new disco, cutting edge electronica, and anything on the forefront of new sound."<ref name=GrizSiteLabel>{{Cite web| url=http://mynameisgriz.com/label| last=Kwiecinski| title=Liberated Music| publisher=Griz Official Website| location=Detroit| year=2013}}</ref> Kwiecinski travels across the U.S & Canada playing at festivals such as Summer Camp, Electric Zoo,<ref name=RStoneEZoo>{{Cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/12-best-things-we-saw-at-electric-zoo-2014-20140902/best-fusion-of-hip-hop-and-woodwind-griz-20140902| last=Shepherd| title=12 Best Things We Saw at Electric Zoo 2014| publisher=Rolling Stone| location=New York| year=2014}}</ref> Electric Forest, Hard Los Angeles, TomorrowWorld, North Coast Festival, Decadence, SnowBall, Lollapalooza and Shambhala.<ref name="HuffPostDetroit"/> He has collaborated with other artists, including Gramatik,<ref name="HuffPostDetroit"/> ExMag and Big Gigantic.<ref name=TSISMadLib>{{Cite web| url=http://thissongissick.com/blog/2012/griz-mad-liberation-album-download/| last=Guarino| title=GRiZ – Mad Liberation (Album) : Must Hear Full Electro Soul / Dubstep / Future Funk Free Album| publisher=ThisSongIsSick| location=Boulder| year=2012}}</ref> His fourth album, [[Say It Loud(GRiZ Album)|Say It Loud]], was released on March 31, 2015.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://thissongissick.com/blog/2015/premiere-griz-funk-party/#sthash.9QvcCT9m.dpbs|title=[PREMIERE] GRiZ – Funk Party : Must Hear Future Funk Anthem|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=thissongissick.com|access-date=2015-03-13}}</ref> In 2016, GRiZ released Good Will Prevail which was his first time charting in the Billboard 200. In 2017, GRiZ kept the good vibes going with the remixed version, Good Will Continue. The year 2019 saw the release of his sixth album, ''Ride Waves'', that exhibited a new sound style with more rapping, and signing than ever before. Once COVID-19 hit GRiZ turned to live streams held via Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube to continue spreading his music.  

12 Days of Grizmas, an annual event hosted by Griz, is intended to generate attention and revenue for non-profits. During the twelve days leading up to his annual two-day festival in Detroit called ''GRiZMAS'', all proceeds generated from events are donated to a variety of charities, and fans are often rewarded for their participation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Middleton|first1=Ryan|title=GRiZ On "Fantastic" Next Record, Sustaining All Good Records, Grizmas: Interview|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/58334/20151215/griz-fantastic-next-record-sustaining-all-good-records-grizmas-interview.htm|access-date=December 17, 2015|publisher=Music Times|date=December 15, 2015}}</ref>

== GRiZFam and Liberators ==
The GRiZFam started out as a way for fans of GRiZ to connect with each other through music, pictures, and other associated art. Liberators are the [[street team]] for GRiZ, and help raise awareness for shows, spread the music, as well as help with charitable organizations. The fans work by the mantra that GRiZ popularized: Show Love, Spread Love.<ref name=ComposeYourselfMagBUKU>{{Cite web| url=http://composeyourselfmag.com/2014/03/team-griz-gives-back-to-the-community/| last=Moon| title=Team GRiZ Gives Back To The Community| publisher=Compose Yourself Mag| location=New Orleans| year=2013}}</ref>
