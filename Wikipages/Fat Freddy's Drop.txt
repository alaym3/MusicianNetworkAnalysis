'''Fat Freddy's Drop''' is a New Zealand seven-piece band from [[Wellington]], whose musical style has been characterised as any combination of [[Dub music|dub]], [[reggae]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[techno]]. Originally a [[jam band]] formed in the late 1990s by musicians from other bands in Wellington, Fat Freddy's Drop gradually became its members' sole focus. Band members continued playing with their other respective groups—[[The Black Seeds]], [[TrinityRoots]], Bongmaster, and others—for much of their 20-year career. Fat Freddy's Drop are known for their improvised live performances. Songs on their studio albums are versions refined over years of playing them live in New Zealand and on tour abroad.

The group gained international recognition in 2003 after their single "Midnight Marauders" was re-distributed by record labels and DJs in Germany. The group has toured Europe nearly every year since then. The first studio album by Fat Freddy's Drop, ''[[Based on a True Story (Fat Freddy's Drop album)|Based on a True Story]]'', was the first independently distributed album to reach first place in New Zealand record sales directly after release in 2005, and is the highest-selling album by a national artist in the country's history. ''Based on a True Story'' won Best Album at the New Zealand Music Awards the same year, and remained on the top 40 New Zealand sales chart for over two years, establishing them as one of the most successful contemporary bands in the island nation.

==History==

===Formation: 1999–2001===
The band Fat Freddy's Drop gradually took shape from members of other bands in [[Wellington]], New Zealand's music scene in the late 1990s. The group's founder, Chris "Mu" Faiumu, had performed with other bands for most of that decade under the name DJ Fitchie. He and two friends, [[trumpet]]er Toby Laing and [[Singing|vocalist]] [[Dallas Tamaira]], occasionally played improvised [[jam session]]s at his seaside home. Faiumu provided percussion and bass for these on an Akai [[Music Production Center]] (MPC).<ref name="rbma"/> All three were involved with other bands. Faiumu and Tamaira were members of the 15-piece dub band Bongmaster;<ref name="bongmaster">{{cite web|url=http://www.muzic.net.nz/artists/205.html|title=Bongmaster|access-date=25 August 2009|work=muzic.net.nz|publisher=The Kiwimusic Network}}</ref> Laing was a member of [[The Black Seeds]].<ref name="stylusmag">{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/fat-freddy/live-at-the-matterhorn.htm |title=Fat Freddy |access-date=6 September 2009 |last=Andrews |first=Chris |date=1 September 2003 |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201161304/http://stylusmagazine.com/reviews/fat-freddy/live-at-the-matterhorn.htm |archive-date=1 February 2010 }}</ref> In 1999, they began performing together at local clubs and festivals,<ref name="starlifter">{{cite thesis |last=McIver |first=Sharon |title=WaveShapeConversion: The Land as Reverent in the Dance Culture and Music of Aotearoa |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Canterbury]] |url=https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/1635 |type=PhD }}</ref> and released several vinyl [[Single (music)|singles]] distributed locally.<ref name="discog">{{cite web|url=http://www.fatfreddysdrop.com/assets/Uploads/FFD-Disc-2008.pdf |title=The Drop Discography |access-date=25 March 2010 |year=2008 |publisher=The Drop |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121174408/http://fatfreddysdrop.com/assets/Uploads/FFD-Disc-2008.pdf |archive-date=21 November 2010 }}</ref>

That same year, Faiumu founded the independent music label The Drop with the help of his partner Nicole, and money from private investors. According to Faiumu, the venture was a learning experience in the business of making and releasing records. The Drop's first release was Dallas Tamaira's solo project, the five-track [[Extended play|EP]] ''Better Than Change'',<ref name="toazted">{{cite video|people=Chris Faiumu, Dallas Tamaira |date=1 August 2005 |title=Interview with Fat Freddy's Drop from Holland |url=http://www.toazted.com/interview/676/Fat-Freddy-39s-Drop.html |format=[[Mp3]] |work=toazted.com |access-date=25 August 2009 |time=00:00:00 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715043000/http://www.toazted.com/interview/676/Fat-Freddy-39s-Drop.html |archive-date=15 July 2009 }}</ref> followed by a single performed by the group named "Hope".

The group organised several informal jam sessions in 2000, inviting local musicians to play with them at Faiumu's home. These sessions led to four new members joining Fat Freddy's Drop: Warren Maxwell on tenor and alto [[saxophone]], Tehimana Kerr on [[guitar]], Iain Gordon on [[Musical keyboard|keyboards]], and Joe Lindsay on [[trombone]].<ref name="guardian2007"/> Like the original three, the new members played with other groups in and around Wellington, and continued to for most of Fat Freddy's Drop's career.<ref name="nzgirl">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzgirl.co.nz/articles/6077|title=Fat Freddy's Drop|access-date=25 August 2009|author=Liselle|date=27 April 2008|work=NZ Girl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211112823/http://nzgirl.co.nz/articles/6077|archive-date=11 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Iain Gordon was a fellow Bongmaster member with Faiumu and Tamaira.

The now-seven-member Fat Freddy's Drop, sometimes calling themselves the "seven-headed soul monster",<ref name="guardian2007"/> continued to play live at clubs and festivals. The band's first full-length album, ''[[Live at the Matterhorn]]'', was released in 2001 by The Drop. The live album is a recording of their show at the Matterhorn club in Wellington that year.

===''Dr Boondigga and the Big BW'': 2009–2012===
Fat Freddy's Drop released their second studio album, ''[[Dr Boondigga and the Big BW]]'', in 2009. The title refers to "the Big Brain-Wash and Dr. Boondigga [who] is some evil creature who's trying to sign us to a major label," according to Faiumu.<ref name="fasterlouder"/> The band is still independently distributed by The Drop label, and as of 2009, have handled distribution themselves in Europe. Like ''Based on a True Story'', the album's songs are polished versions of songs they developed over four years at live shows; mixed from 2007 to 2009 in-between tours.<ref name="vine"/> Unlike their last album, most of it was recorded live in-studio with all band members present. There were some exceptions; [[Alice Russell (singer)|Alice Russell]]'s duet with Tamaira on the album's first single "The Camel" was recorded in 2006 when she was in Wellington with [[The Bamboos (funk band)|The Bamboos]].

=== ''Bays: 2015'' ===
New material was teased in early in October 2014 on NZ radio and Fat Freddy's Drop released ''Slings and Arrows'' 17 October 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fatfreddysdrop.com/slings-and-arrows-single|title=SLINGS AND ARROWS SINGLE {{!}} Fat Freddys Drop|website=www.fatfreddysdrop.com|access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref> Starting with an 8-bit intro the song blossomed in to what they said was their most reggae track thus far. The subsequent album [[Fat Freddy's Drop discography|Bays]] was released the following year on 23 October 2015, reaching the number 1 in New Zealand and 12 In Australia. The album title is derived from their home base in Wellington where the majority of the album was written.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fatfreddysdrop.com/new-album-bays|title=New Album 'BAYS' {{!}} Fat Freddys Drop|website=www.fatfreddysdrop.com|access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref> Widening the sphere of influence which colours their music the new album features more electronic flavour in ''Wheels'' and ''Cortina Motors,'' which seems like a true evolution, and more soulful moments in ''Makkan'' where Dallas already resides.

=== ''Special Edition Part 1'' ===
On 20 July 2018, the single ''Trickle Down'' was released and fifth studio album confirmed.<ref>{{Citation|last=Fat Freddy's Drop|title=Fat Freddy's Drop 'Trickle Down' Single|date=19 July 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HteR5WAUXFo|access-date=3 March 2019}}</ref> Following this, a tour of Europe commenced, which included tease performances of three new songs: ''Special Edition, 114 and Kamo, Kamo.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fatfreddysdrop.com/autumn-drop-summertime|title=Autumn Drop to Summertime {{!}} Fat Freddys Drop|website=www.fatfreddysdrop.com|access-date=3 March 2019}}</ref> On 10 October 2019, the single ''Kamo Kamo'' was released, along with an official name and release date for the upcoming album.

Improvisation, live and in the studio, has been the basis for Fat Freddy's Drop's music since the beginning of their career. "Live performance is the most natural state for music," according to trumpeter Toby Laing.<ref name="nzgirl"/> Most songs begin as a rhythm on Faiumu's MPC, and more sections are progressively added during jam sessions. Songs featured on the band's albums and singles are versions that have been refined over years of playing them in the studio, live in Wellington, and on tour abroad. Faiumu said that, on their first studio album, it was challenging to fit the long songs the band is used to playing into shorter album-length tracks.<ref name="ebeats"/>

Describing the band, [[National Public Radio]] host [[Guy Raz]] said, "Take the swagger of Jamaican dub, throw in a little Memphis soul and send it halfway down the globe, and what comes back? The band Fat Freddy's Drop."<ref>{{cite video|people=Guy Raz, Chris Faiumu, Toby Laing|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121933075|title=Fat Freddy's Drop Blends Reggae, Soul And DJ Culture|access-date=25 March 2010|date=26 December 2009|format=[[Adobe Flash]]|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}</ref> The band has been categorised under many genres, and members say many of those genres helped shape their musical style: [[delta blues]], [[jazz]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[techno]], and contemporary [[rhythm and blues]].<ref name="nzgirl"/><ref name="lumier">{{cite web|url=http://www.lumiere.net.nz/reader/item/308 |title=DJ Mu on Fat Freddy's Drop |access-date=25 August 2009 |last=Bisley |first=Alexander |date=25 November 2005 |work=The Lumière Reader |publisher=Lumière Industries |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522113344/http://www.lumiere.net.nz/reader/item/308 |archive-date=22 May 2010 }}</ref> Musical styles heard while on tour have also shaped their sound; ''Dr Boondigga and the Big BW'' was influenced by contemporary [[Music of Germany|German]], [[Music of Portugal|Portuguese]], and [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] music while touring in the years before its release.<ref name="fasterlouder"/>

Faiumu and other band members say their biggest influence is their home country of New Zealand, and their peers in Wellington's "small-but-solid" music scene<ref name="remixmag">{{cite web|url=http://emusician.com/remixmag/artists_interviews/musicians/remix_fat_freddys_drop/index.html|title=FAT FREDDY'S DROP|access-date=25 August 2009|last=Umile|first=Dominic|date=1 March 2007|work=[[Remix Magazine]]|publisher=[[Penton Media]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605050914/http://emusician.com/remixmag/artists_interviews/musicians/remix_fat_freddys_drop/index.html|archive-date=5 June 2011}}</ref>—Wellington's population was fewer than 180,000 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellington.govt.nz/plans/annualplan/0708/pdfs/03snapshot.pdf|title=Wellington City Council Annual Plan 2007–2008|access-date=5 August 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001193659/http://www.wellington.govt.nz/plans/annualplan/0708/pdfs/03snapshot.pdf|archive-date=1 October 2008}}</ref> They feel their music "belong[s] here in New Zealand, you can tell it came from this country."<ref name="lumier"/> Fat Freddy's Drop's music has been categorised as Aotearoa roots music—meaning contemporary music inspired by [[Māori culture|Māori]] and Pacific Islander culture, even though they are a mixed-race group. Faiumu is a first-generation Samoan-New Zealander, Tamaira, Gordon and Kerr are native Māori, and the remaining members are descended from European immigrants.
