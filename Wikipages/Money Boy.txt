'''Money Boy''' (born June 27, 1981 in [[Vienna]], also known as ''Mbeezy'', interim ''Why SL Know Plug'', ''YSL Know Plug'', ''Why SL Beezy'', ''Mbeezy Pineapple The Fruit Dude'' and other pseudonyms, born as Sebastian Meisinger) is an Austrian rap-singer. He became famous with his hit ''Dreh den Swag auf''.

==Biography==
Money Boy grew up in the 15th district of Vienna, Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus. By 2008, he studied Journalism and Communication at the University of Vienna. He successfully graduated with the degree Magister philosophiae. His master's thesis was about Gangsta Rap in Germany. Before starting with rap, he played basketball for a long time. He initially wrote his lyrics in English. After his first public title, ''Ching, Chang, Chung'', Money Boy caught attention in late summer 2010 after publishing his cover Version of Soulja Boy's ''Turn My Swag On'', ''Dreh den Swag auf''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 2014, he gained attention for his appearance in a live show on Swiss TV channel ''joiz'', during which he recommended the recreational use of Heroin and MDMA at parties. Some of the Twitter messages which were contributed by the TV audience, and were read out on live TV by a moderator included ″Take drugs and rape sluts" and "I just took Heroin and I'm having a really good time"; regarding the latter one, the moderator stated that he "did not know if this is meant seriously or just a joke". One of the moderators also alleged that he urinated on the wall of the TV station building during a break.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UutshUjBwTY Best Of Money Boy Interview @Joiz (Blind Date / 11.11.2014) - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For that performance, Money Boy got an award by German TV station [[ProSieben]]. He attended the awarding ceremony, which was broadcast on TV, and recited his acceptance speech as a [[rap]].<ref>[http://www.prosieben.de/tv/circus-halligalli/videos/415-der-goldene-mummberto-fuer-verblueffende-ansichten-moneyboy-clip CIRCUS HALLIGALLI - Video - Der goldene Mummberto für verblüffende Ansichten: Moneyboy - ProSieben<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2015, he performed with members of the ''Glo Up Dinero Gang'' at the sold out ''VideoDays'', including an ambiguous statement about recreational drug use at the end of his performance: "Drugs are bad, I confess that shit; but I am high, so I have no problems with it.".<ref>{{Citation|last=VideoDays|title=Spinning 9 und Money Boy I VideoDays Köln 2015|date=2015-08-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHglBqNg19A|accessdate=2016-06-08}}</ref><ref group="note">German original statement: "Drogen sind schlecht, ich gesteh' den shit; aber ich bin high, also habe ich keine Probleme damit."</ref>
