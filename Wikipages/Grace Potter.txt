===''Midnight''===

Potter's second solo album, ''Midnight'', was released on August 14, 2015, on [[Hollywood Records]].<ref name="hollywoodrecords.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodrecords.com/artists/grace-potter/|title=Grace Potter|access-date=March 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410195712/http://www.hollywoodrecords.com/artists/grace-potter/|archive-date=April 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Midnight'' was recorded and mixed at Barefoot Studios in Hollywood with producer [[Eric Valentine]], who has worked with artists ranging from [[Queens of the Stone Age]] to [[Nickel Creek]]. The core studio band consisted of Potter and Valentine along with Matt Burr on drums and percussion. Members of Potter's band The Nocturnals – Scott Tournet, Benny Yurco and bassist Michael Libramento – played guitar, while friends such as [[Rayland Baxter]], [[Audra Mae]], [[Noelle Scaggs]] of [[Fitz and the Tantrums]], [[Wayne Coyne]] of [[The Flaming Lips]], and [[Nick Oliveri]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]] played various instruments. Potter cites an eclectic array of musical influences for ''Midnight''{{'}}s unique sound, including [[Miles Davis]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Beatles]], [[David Bowie]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Beck]].

The seeds for ''Midnight'' were planted in Vermont during the fall of 2013. Potter explains the evolution of the record: <blockquote>I had been messing around for a few weeks with making really wacked-out home demos – lots of sounds, beats and melodies that I had never tried before. It was a dark, stormy, moody day and I could hear the thunder in the distance – these big ominous clouds were rolling in fast. There was something about that threat of inclement weather beyond my control that just made me vibrate with anticipation and adrenaline, so I channeled it into this heavy boogie song—it goes right for the throat and says 'Own your existence on earth, because who knows what's gonna happen next.' That solitary moment guided everything that followed.<ref name="hollywoodrecords.com"/></blockquote>
