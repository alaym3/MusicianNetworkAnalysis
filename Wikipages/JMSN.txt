After the success of ''Priscilla'', Christian (as JMSN) released his album ''Pllaje'', on November 5, 2013. This garnered him more acclaim in the community, and he gained recognition in the music industry. Christian began collaborating with other artists, like J. Cole and The Game, while releasing ''Pllaje'''s visuals through his YouTube channel for: "Love Myself", "The One" and "Thing U Miss". In 2013, his North American tour took him to over 20 cities where he both opened and headlined the shows.

On December 9, 2014 Christian released his second album ''The Blue Album''. In 2015, he toured to promote the album.

=== 2016–present ===

On March 1, 2016, Christian released a soulful and jazzy single, "Cruel Intentions".<ref>{{cite web|title=JMSN Shares Moving New Single, "Cruel Intentions"|url=http://hypetrak.com/2016/03/jmsn-cruel-intentions/|website=Hypetrak|publisher=HP Cheung|access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> The release of this song was followed by the singles: "Most of All",<ref name=":0" /> "Hypnotized,"<ref name=":1" /> and a [[Snoh Aalegra]] remix of "Cruel Intentions".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cruel-intentions-remix-feat./id1097224974|title=Cruel Intentions (Remix) [feat.

In August 2016, Christian revealed that he is the elusive artist Pearl, shortly after dropping Pearl's new album, ''Closer''.
