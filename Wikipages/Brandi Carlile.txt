Carlile has been a part of several activism campaigns and an advocate for causes ranging from spreading awareness for health issues to LGBT rights and empowerment of women.

==Life and career==
===1981–2003: Early life===
Carlile was born on June 1, 1981,<ref>{{cite web|title = Brandi Carlile {{!}} Music Biography, Streaming Radio and Discography {{!}} AllMusic|url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brandi-carlile-mn0000376793|website = AllMusic|access-date = April 2, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120614151345/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brandi-carlile-mn0000376793|archive-date = June 14, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> in [[Ravensdale, Washington]], a small town 30 miles outside [[Seattle]]. Growing up in the only house for miles, Carlile played in the woods, built forts, and played music with her brother Jay and sister Tiffany. When she was five, Carlile contracted bacterial [[meningitis]], which almost took her life. Her heart flatlined several times and she was in a coma.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carlile|first=Brandi|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1235902377|title=Broken horses|date=2021|isbn=978-0-593-23724-3|location=New York|pages=10|oclc=1235902377}}</ref>

Carlile taught herself to sing when she was a child, and she began singing country songs on stage when she was eight-years old. At age eight, Carlile performed [[Johnny Cash]]'s "[[Tennessee Flat Top Box]]" with her mother, Teresa Carlile,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://harpmagazine.com/reviews/cd_reviews/detail.cfm?article_id=5741 |title=Brandi Carlile |last=Aaron |first=Kace |date=June 2007 |newspaper=Harp Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201195951/http://harpmagazine.com/reviews/cd_reviews/detail.cfm?article_id=5741 |archive-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> and began playing the guitar and writing songs at age 15.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cackett |first=Alan |title=Brandi Carlile |newspaper=Maverick |page=11 |date=March 2008 }}</ref> At 16, Carlile became a backup singer for an [[Elvis impersonator]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Telling |first=Gillian |title=10 Artists to Watch: Brandi Carlile |newspaper=Rolling Stone |page=30 |date=March 24, 2005 }}</ref> According to Carlile, she was diagnosed with [[attention-deficit disorder]] as a teen.

===2004–2006: Career beginnings and debut===
[[File:brandi-carlile2.jpg|thumb|upright|Carlile performing in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] in 2006]]

Carlile began her career performing in Seattle music clubs with twin brothers Tim and Phil Hanseroth.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Scanlon |first=Tom |title=Rising stars Jesse Sykes and Brandi Carlile thrill hometown |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News. |page=1 |date=April 1, 2007 }}</ref> In the beginning, [[Columbia Records]] signed Carlile in 2004 on the strength of songs she had been recording periodically at home. Released in 2005, Carlile showcased those early songs along with newly-recorded tracks in the self-titled album ''[[Brandi Carlile (album)|Brandi Carlile]]''. The 2006 re-release by Columbia Records included re-recordings of "Throw It All Away" and "What Can I Say".

The album earned enthusiastic reviews; she was featured on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s "10 Artists to Watch in 2005" list, and other "artist to watch" lists by [[Interview (magazine)|''Interview'']] and [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'']]. In his review of the album, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote, "The accolades, combined with cover artwork that captures her at her cutest – as if she were a cousin of [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] – might make some listeners suspicious of Carlile, since the cumulative effect makes her seem like a pretty, prepackaged creation." He further wrote, "her music is... rich, warm, and seductive, familiar in its form and sound, yet sounding fresh, even original, particularly in how her folky singer/songwriter foundation blends with her art-pop inclinations."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/brandi-carlile-mw0000190795 |title=Brandi Carlile – Brandi Carlile – Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards – AllMusic |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212082356/http://www.allmusic.com/album/brandi-carlile-mw0000190795 |archive-date=February 12, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The album peaked at No. 80 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard charts|US Folk Albums]] chart.

Shortly after the release of the album, she left her home in [[Seattle]] and set out with the Hanseroth brothers, as she had worked with them on her earliest recordings and independent regional tours. The tightly-knit trio, which forms the core of her band today, spent the better part of two years on the road honing the songs that would later become part of her album [[The Story (Brandi Carlile album)|''The Story'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile |title=Brandi Carlile |website=Last.fm |access-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120041833/http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile |archive-date=January 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

By the end of 2006, Carlile had embarked on several headlining tours and supported a variety of artists, including [[Ray LaMontagne]], [[the Fray]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Tori Amos]], and [[Shawn Colvin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile/+wiki |title=Brandi Carlile |website=Last.fm |access-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112134914/http://www.last.fm/music/Brandi+Carlile/+wiki |archive-date=January 12, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2007–2009: Breakthrough with ''The Story''===
[[File:Brandi Carlile (170274098).jpg|thumb|left|Her song "[[The Story (song)|The Story]]" became her first single to reach No. 1 (in Portugal).]]
Her second album, ''[[The Story (Brandi Carlile album)|The Story]]'', was produced by [[T Bone Burnett]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://folkmusic.about.com/od/brandicarlile/a/BCarlileQA.htm |title=About.com: Interview With Brandi Carlile |publisher=Folkmusic.about.com |date=June 14, 2010 |access-date=September 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516214315/http://folkmusic.about.com/od/brandicarlile/a/BCarlileQA.htm |archive-date=May 16, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> It includes a collaboration with the [[Indigo Girls]] on "Cannonball." The album was recorded in an 11-day session with Carlile, the Hanseroths, and drummer [[Matt Chamberlain]] to capture the raw intensity of Carlile's live performances. The crack in Carlile's vocals during the title track, "The Story", came out by accident and was a direct result of the way the album was recorded. "The Story" was featured heavily in [[General Motors]] commercials during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], leading to increased exposure to her music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/heard/289/let-the-games-begin-olympic-ads-go-for-the-gold |title=Yahoo Music |date=October 14, 2014 |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910185853/http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/heard/289/let-the-games-begin-olympic-ads-go-for-the-gold |archive-date=September 10, 2008 |access-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In response to the advertisement, album sales increased 368 percent from 1,323 to 6,198. Sales for the lead single, "The Story", increased in downloads of 28,091 copies."The Story" peaked at No. 5 on the [[iTunes]] Music Store's most-purchased list. The song was also used in the 2008 commercial for [[Super Bock]] and helped the song reach No. 1 and the album reach No. 4 on the Portuguese charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://acharts.us/album/14949 |title=Brandi Carlile – The Story |publisher=ACharts |access-date=February 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312102502/http://acharts.us/album/14949 |archive-date=March 12, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> "The Story" was featured on the end credits of the romantic drama film ''[[The Lucky One (film)|The Lucky One]]''. The album has sold more than 257,776 copies in the US and peaked at No. 41 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' 200]] and No. 10 on the [[Billboard charts|US Rock Albums]] chart.

Music critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] praised Carlile for ''The Story'' saying, "The roiling collection fulfills the promise of her remarkable debut, offering resounding confirmation that Carlile is a singular talent."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-story-mw0000478967 |title=The Story – Brandi Carlile – Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards – AllMusic |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212083552/http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-story-mw0000478967 |archive-date=February 12, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

"It wasn't until 2007's ''The Story'' – her T-Bone Burnett-produced sophomore release – that we realized even half of what we'd been dealt. Nearly a minute into the second song, something about her shifted from promise to absolute certainty as Carlile let loose a hurricane of lung power" wrote Rachael Maddux for [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'']] magazine.
[[File:Brandi Carlile Parish 41.JPG|thumb| Carlile's album ''[[Give Up the Ghost (album)|Give Up the Ghost]]'' debuted at No. 26 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and also received positive reviews from critics.]]
Three songs from her previous album, "Tragedy," "What Can I Say," and "Throw It All Away," were featured in the TV drama ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. A special two-hour episode of ''Grey's Anatomy'' also featured Carlile's song "Turpentine" during footage of the spin-off, ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]''. ''Grey's Anatomy'' also released a version of the music video for "The Story" with interspersed footage of the show. Actress [[Sara Ramirez]] performed her version of Carlile's single "The Story" in the [[Song Beneath the Song|musical episode]] of the show.

In 2007, Carlile performed at the Borderline in London and as guest on [[Newton Faulkner]]'s UK tour. She was the opening act for [[Maroon 5]] and [[OneRepublic]] during their Australia tour.<ref>[http://www.frontiertouring.com.au/currenttours/Maroon_5__Australia_amp;_New_Zealand_2008 Frontiertouring.com.au]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402020854/http://www.frontiertouring.com.au/currenttours/Maroon_5__Australia_amp%3B_New_Zealand_2008 |date=April 2, 2008 }}</ref> In April 2008, she performed on the [[BBC2]] show ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''.

In one of the reviews of the album for ''Paste'', Rachael Maddux wrote, "Writhing and burning and staring at life straight down the barrel, ''Give Up the Ghost'' is exactly the album Carlile needed to make at this moment. The production is thick but elegant, applied with full knowledge that the songs could exist beautifully in a sparse acoustic-strummed daze, but that they deserve more than that." She added, "The best part about ''Give Up the Ghost''? She will probably make an even better album one day."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/brandi-carlile/brandi-carlile-give-up-the-ghost/ |title=Brandi Carlile: Give Up the Ghost |website=Paste |date=October 6, 2009 |first=Rachel |last=Maddux |access-date=February 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729133212/https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/brandi-carlile/brandi-carlile-give-up-the-ghost/ |archive-date=July 29, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2010–2014: Continued success===
[[File:Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, Brandi Carlile 2012.JPG|thumb|left|Carlile and the Oregon Symphony at the [[Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 2012]]
In 2011, Carlile's album ''[[Live at Benaroya Hall with the Seattle Symphony]]'' reached number 14 on the [[Top Rock Albums]] chart. The live album finds Carlile performing a mix of original songs and cover material. Recorded during two sold-out shows in November 2010 at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Washington, the album features [[Washington (state)|Washington]]-native Carlile and her long-time band (including brothers [[Phil and Tim Hanseroth]]) performing alongside the [[Seattle Symphony]]. Andrew Leahey from [[AllMusic]] called it Carlile's best and wrote, "'Live at Benaroya Hall' is more concerned with dressing up Carlile's music in elegant, orchestral clothing, and the results are pretty stunning, from the grandeur of "The Story" – now featuring horns, woodwinds, and strings. This isn't Brandi Carlile's first concert album, but it's certainly the best."

"We didn't make any demos. To me rock and roll isn't really a genre but more of recklessness or a risk," Carlile told [[NPR Music|NPR]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diffuser.fm/10-albums-worth-looking-forward-to-in-early-2015/ |title=10 Albums Worth Looking Forward to in Early 2015 |website=[[Diffuser.fm|Diffuser]] |access-date=January 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103095833/http://diffuser.fm/10-albums-worth-looking-forward-to-in-early-2015/ |archive-date=January 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> "The more something gets ironed out and sure of itself, the less it begins to rock somehow.

Rooted in Carlile's love of both [[classic country]] and California pop, the song is the kind many other artists are going to want to cover. It will be hard to top the original, though; it so eloquently highlights the telepathic connection Carlile shares with her longtime bandmates. A favorite on recent tours, "The Eye" is destined to become a centerpiece in Carlile's catalog."<ref name="npr.org"/>

The album was No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s Top Rock Album Chart,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6502048/brandi-carlile-career-highs-rock-charts |title=Brandi Carlile Scores Multiple Career Highs on Rock Charts |website=Billboard.com |access-date=April 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909113713/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6502048/brandi-carlile-career-highs-rock-charts |archive-date=September 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and a first for her.

''[[KCMP|The Current]]'' reviewing the album wrote,
{{blockquote|I thought she leaned too adult-contemporary for my tastes. Boy, was I wrong! This might be her most rockin' album to date. The album starts like a house afire: Carlile totally nails the vocal on the gospel influenced "Wherever Is Your Heart," and this one makes you realize just how good she is. When she sings, you're a believer. She'll have you singing along on the infectious "The Thing I Regret". Maybe the biggest surprise on the album is "Mainstream Kid," which shows some grit! It's as badass as Carlile has ever sounded. If you had Brandi Carlile pegged as an adult-contemporary softie, you might try again. Brandi Carlile and the Hanseroth twins show that they aren't afraid to rock out. ''The Firewatcher's Daughter'' is a bold and welcome addition to her catalogue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/03/02/album-review-brandi-carlile-the-firewatchers-daughter |title=Album Review: Brandi Carlile, 'The Firewatcher's Daughter' |author=Bill DeVille |date=March 2, 2015 |website=The Current|via=[[Minnesota Public Radio]] |access-date=December 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125439/http://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/03/02/album-review-brandi-carlile-the-firewatchers-daughter |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

| quote       = Aligned to her storybook interest, Brandi’s tattoos reference a cult 1980s kids’ film. The serpentine symbol of The NeverEnding Story have been recreated on the singer’s shoulders. {{'}}The NeverEnding Story’s my favourite,{{'}} Brandi exclaimed with vigour. {{'}}I have the Orin tattooed on each shoulder, since I really love symmetry. I had it tattooed very lightly so that they always looked vintage and identical. I love The Goonies and I love Labyrinth too!{{'}}
