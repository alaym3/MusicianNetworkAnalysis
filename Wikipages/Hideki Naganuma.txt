Naganuma is best known for his score for the game ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' and its sequel ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]''.

==Early life==
Naganuma started his musical career by playing the [[electronic organ]], aged five, under the influence of his older sister. When he was fourteen, he became interested in western music and composed his own songs. He then decided to have a job in the music business.<ref name="Rocketbaby">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocketbaby.net/interviews_hideki_naganuma_jsr.html |title=Hideki Naganuma Interview |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927090737/http://www.rocketbaby.net/interviews_hideki_naganuma_jsr.html |archivedate=September 27, 2003 }}</ref> During 1993 to 1997 he worked as both a DJ and bartender. He was also aiming to become a singer-songwriter in the J-pop industry,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/Hideki_Naganuma/status/665568131608276992 | title=I had written lyrics. Long ago, I was trying 2 be a singer-songwriter in J-Pop industry. But 4 games… no plan at this moment | accessdate=14 November 2015 | author=Naganuma, Hideki}}</ref> although he dropped this plan.

== Career ==

=== 1998{{ndash}}2008: Work with Sega ===
Naganuma sent demo tapes to [[Sega]] in 1998. His application was accepted, with voice editing for ''[[Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Itsuka Kakumei Sareru Monogatari]]'' and composition for ''Hip Jog Jog'' being among his first works with the company, the latter of which he worked with senior composer Kenichi Tokoi.

In 2000, he served as the lead composer for ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'', serving as his breakthrough work. He took inspiration from [[big beat]] music for the game. He would go on to compose for its sequel ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]'' in 2002, along with ''[[Ollie King]]'' in 2003, also developed by Smilebit. In 2005, he composed a large portion of ''[[Sonic Rush]]'''s soundtrack.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mambrucchi|first=Steeve|date=2005-12-05|title=Sonic Rush Test|url=https://www.jeuxactu.com/test-sonic-rush-12398.htm|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-08|website=JeuxActu|language=French}}</ref> The following year, he was responsible for music supervision and composing two tracks for the anime adaption of ''[[Air Gear]]'', itself being influenced by ''Jet Set Radio''. For contractual reasons, he used the "skankfunk" alias as he was still employed at Sega at the time, while ''Air Gear'' had nothing to do with Sega.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/Hideki_Naganuma/status/516770359945617408 | title=It's a contractual matter. | accessdate=14 November 2015 | author=Naganuma, Hideki}}</ref> He also created a remix of "Fuusen Gum" for the anime ''[[Gin Tama]]'', but similarly was not credited at the time.

During his later years with Sega, Naganuma was part of ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]''{{'s}} team, where his role was mostly limited to voice editing and producing sound effects. The boss of its team did not allow him to work on the soundtrack of ''[[Sonic Rush Adventure]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Naganuma |first=Hideki |date=18 June 2020 |title=I wanted to make music for Sonic Rush Adventure too but my boss didn't let me do it. Because I was in Yakuza team at the time. |url=https://twitter.com/Hideki_Naganuma/status/1273638608717504513}}</ref> Following his work on ''[[Yakuza Kenzan]]'' in 2008, he left Sega to become a freelance composer. He has continued to work on Sega titles under the skankfunk alias, including ''[[Kurohyō: Ryū ga Gotoku Shinshō]]'' and ''[[Super Monkey Ball 3D]]''.

=== 2008{{ndash}}present: Freelance work ===
During the earlier years following his departure from Sega, Naganuma contributed a handful of tracks to various Sega games such as ''[[Kurohyō: Ryū ga Gotoku Shinshō]]'' and ''[[Super Monkey Ball 3D]]'', under the skankfunk alias. In 2012, he contributed the track "Luv Can Save U" for the [[Beatmania IIDX 20: Tricoro|20th installment]] of [[Konami]]'s arcade rhythm game ''[[Beatmania IIDX]]'', and for the [[Beatmania IIDX 21: Spada|21st installment]] an extended mix of the aforemented track. In 2014, Naganuma contributed to the charity CD ''Game Music Prayer II'' for relief of the 2011 [[Great East Japan Earthquake]] with an original track titled "Aria di Maria".<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Ohji|first=Masashi|date=2014-04-15|title=東日本大震災義援金チャリティCD「Game Music Prayer 2」がM3などで限定リリース。49組のゲーム音楽作曲家が参加した2枚組みコンピアルバム|url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20140415037/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-08|website=www.4gamer.net|language=Japanese}}</ref>

By the late 2010s, he became popular on the social network platform [[Twitter]], where he frequently interacts with fans and posts internet [[internet meme|meme]]s and [[shitposting|shitposts]] related to ''Jet Set Radio'' and other media, such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[Among Us]]'' or ''[[Wabbit Twouble|Big Chungus]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15458220/hideki-naganuma-jet-set-radio-remake-sega |title=Jet Set Radio composer would like to remind you that he can’t make a new game happen |last=Frank |first=Allegra |date=April 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thegamer.com/hideki-naganuma-family-guy-lois-griffin/ |title=Is A Famed Game Composer Thirsty For Family Guy's Lois Griffin? |last=Murray |first=Sean |date=March 17, 2020 |website=TheGamer}}</ref> 

As a result of his online popularity and musical success, he has contributed tracks to a number of indie games inspired by ''Jet Set Radio''. In 2017, Naganuma contributed two new original songs for the game ''Hover''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-04-19|title=The composer of Jet Set Radio has new music for Hover|url=https://www.destructoid.com/the-composer-of-jet-set-radio-has-new-music-for-hover/|access-date=2021-06-08|website=Destructoid|language=en-CA}}</ref> In 2018, Naganuma released the track "Ain't Nothin' Like a Funky Beat" as a part of the ''[[Lethal League Blaze]]'' soundtrack,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Lucas|date=2018-12-20|title=How Lethal League Blaze became the future's best ball game|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-lethal-league-blaze-became-the-futures-best-ball-game/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-08|website=GamesRadar|language=}}</ref> which featured other notable composers such as [[Frank Klepacki]], Pixelord, [[Bignic]], and Klaus Veen.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Pavlovic|first=Uros|date=2018-09-10|title=Lethal League Blaze PS4 Officially Coming Out During 2019|url=https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/09/10/lethal-league-blaze-ps4-coming-2019/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-08|website=PlayStation LifeStyle}}</ref> He was set to compose for ''[[Streets of Rage 4]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Sal|date=July 17, 2019|title=Streets of Rage 4 ‘Behind the Tracks’ developer diary|url=https://gematsu.com/2019/07/streets-of-rage-4-behind-the-tracks-developer-diary|website=Gematsu|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref> but due to schedule complications and copyright ownership issues, he withdrew from the project in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-naganuma-no-longer-composing-for-streets-of-rage-4-due-to-scheduling-complications/ |title=Hideki Naganuma No Longer Composing Streets of Rage 4 Soundtrack Due to Scheduling Complications |last=Wong |first=Alistar |date=March 20, 2020 |website=Siliconera}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Naganuma|first=Hideki|date=December 9, 2020|title=Naganuma’s reasons for dropping out of SoR4|url=https://twitter.com/hideki_naganuma/status/1336725154886369281?s=21|url-status=live|access-date=August 7, 2021|website=Twitter}}</ref>

Naganuma admitted that since leaving Sega, he has made attempts to work for [[Nintendo]], after the topic was brought up by fans of the ''[[Splatoon]]'' franchise that he should have worked on the latest games' soundtrack, who drew parallels between it and his previous works.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carter|first=Chris|date=2020-10-06|title=Absolute legend and Jet Set Radio composer Hideki Naganuma muses on how he 'tried to be an employee of Nintendo twice'|url=https://www.destructoid.com/absolute-legend-and-jet-set-radio-composer-hideki-naganuma-muses-on-how-he-tried-to-be-an-employee-of-nintendo-twice/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-08|website=Destructoid|language=}}</ref> He is composing for indie game ''Bomb Rush Cyberfunk'', which is set to be released in 2022.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hetfeld |first1=Malindy |title=Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is an indie ode to Jet Set Radio, with the original composer |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-is-an-indie-ode-to-jet-set-radio-with-the-original-composer/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=22 July 2020}}</ref> He has also expressed a desire to create an original album.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PngFE9mUEj8 |title=第1676回　Game Music Composer　Hideki Naganuma |date=December 17, 2019 |type=Video |language=Japanese}}</ref>
