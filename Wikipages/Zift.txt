'''''Zift''''' ({{lang-bg|Дзифт}}, ''Dzift'') is a 2008 [[black-and-white]] Bulgarian [[drama film]] that combines [[neo-noir]]<ref name=quietearth>{{cite news|url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2008/09/07/TIFF-08-Review-of-ZIFT|title=TIFF 08: Review of ZIFT |last=Allison |first=John |date=2008-09-07 |publisher=Quiet Earth |access-date=2008-10-15}}</ref> and [[black comedy]] with [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|socialist retro]] motifs; it is based on [[Vladislav Todorov]]'s 2006 same-named novel and he also wrote the script. ''Zift'' was directed by [[Javor Gardev]] and premiered on 27 June 2008 at the [[30th Moscow International Film Festival]], where it won a Silver George for Best Director and the Best Film Prize of the Russian Film Clubs Federation.<ref name="Moscow2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2008 |title=30th Moscow International Film Festival (2008) |access-date=2013-06-01 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421050837/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2008 |archive-date=April 21, 2013 }}</ref>

The film stars [[Zachary Baharov]] as Moth, the main character who organizes a robbery out of love and money and is imprisoned before the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|9 September coup d'état]] for a murder he did not commit. Moth is released from jail in the 1960s to meet the new and unfamiliar reality of socialist [[Sofia]].

''Zift'''s name is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanword ''zift'' or ''dzift'', meaning "[[asphalt]]", "[[bitumen]]" or "[[Pitch (resin)|black pitch]]", once a popular chewing substance among the gangs in Sofia's asphalt jungle; the word is also said to be urban [[slang]] for [[shit]].<ref name=evestnik>{{cite news|url=http://e-vestnik.bg/4143|title="Дзифт" взриви Московския кинофестивал|date=2008-06-29|publisher=e-vestnik.bg|language=bg|access-date=2008-10-15}}</ref>

==Plot==
''Zift'''s plot unfolds non-linearly: although the main story after Moth's release from prison is told chronologically, the events leading to his imprisonment are revealed by means of numerous relatively long and not necessarily chronological [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. The story is presented chronologically here.

Moth is an ordinary guy from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. At school, he falls in love with the beautiful Ada ([[Tanya Ilieva]]), later nicknamed "Mantis". Out of a desire for money, he agrees to work for a shady neighbour known as Slug ([[Vladimir Penev]]). The two plot the theft of a [[Carbonado|black diamond]] from the [[white émigré]] [[jeweller]] Vlad the Bijou's house. The robbery ends in failure as Moth is wounded by The Bijou and captured by the police; Slug manages to escape and is never charged. There is no trace of the diamond, and as Vlad is killed by Slug during the robbery, the police never get to know of its existence.

In the Sofia prison, Moth, besides working out to patriotic [[Soviet music]], also befriends his older roommate Van Wurst the Eye ([[Mihail Mutafov]]), so nicknamed because he has been wearing an [[ocular prosthesis]] after losing one of his eyes during a robbery in [[Barcelona]]. Besides being an avid [[boxing|boxer]] and [[arm wrestling|arm wrestler]], Van Wurst also has his [[philosophy|philosophical]] views on life, such as a theory about the destructive power of [[women]], which he shares with Moth. Shortly before being released, Van Wurst [[hanging|hangs himself]], claiming "there is no hope outside". While in prison, Moth is informed by Ada that his son Leonid was born and died of lockjaw while still very young.

As Moth is released from prison afterwards, he picks up his civil clothes and his year-old ball of chewing bitumen from the cloakroom and does not miss the chance to swear at an obnoxious guard, who [[headbutt]]s him to unconsciousness. Outside, Moth is picked by a warrant officer and a younger soldier who drive him in a [[Chaika (car)|Chaika]] to [[Sofia Public Mineral Baths|the Baths]]. In the damp basement of the Baths, he is interrogated and tortured by Slug, now a locally influential member of the communist ''[[nomenklatura]]'', who believes Moth knows the location of the black diamond. Moth denies and even doubts the diamond ever existed; he later manages to escape, but not before he consumes [[iridium]]-poisoned wine offered to him by Slug.

Wandering drunk and intoxicated around Sofia and seeking his old girlfriend Ada, Moth gets to witness the new socialist reality he had only heard about on the prison radio: the look of the city has changed with [[Largo, Sofia|The Largo]] and the [[Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum]], but the nature of the people has remained essentially the same. The protagonist meets a variety of bizarre characters, such as drug-doing medics, weird patients and local drunks. He ends up in the Saint Nicholas Church, where he meets the priest who had baptized him ([[Đoko Rosić]]); the priest points him to Ada's current whereabouts as a performer in a [[nightclub]] under the [[stage name]] Gilda (a reference to ''[[Gilda]]'', as Ada also performs a Bulgarian-language version of ''Put the Blame on Mame'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1264914/movieconnections|title=Movie connections for Zift (2008)|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=2008-10-15}}</ref>

Moth finds Ada, who is now living with Slug, and has [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with her. He later reveals to Ada that he is aware of the diamond's location: in Vlad the Bijou's [[coffin]]. The two go to the graveyard, where Moth first insists to visit the grave of his son. However, he realizes that it is another Leonid's grave (his mother had been buried in the same grave very recently) and that he never actually had a son. At the same time he notices Slug standing behind him with Ada, who had apparently betrayed him. The three head to The Bijou's grave; while digging, Moth kills Slug with his [[pickaxe]], but is fatally wounded and stunned by Ada a moment later.

Moth wakes up in the gravediggers' shed. Realizing his impending death, he asks for his bitumen in order not to die with a foul breath. Tearing the bitumen apart, Moth reveals the black diamond had been stashed within it for all those years. He swallows the diamond and dies.<ref name=quietearth/><ref name=evestnik/>
