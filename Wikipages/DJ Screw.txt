'''Robert Earl Davis Jr.''' (July 20, 1971 &ndash; November 16, 2000), better known by his stage name '''DJ Screw''', was an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] based in [[Houston, Texas]], and best known as the creator of the now-famous [[chopped and screwed]] DJ technique.<ref name="nyt"/> He was a central and influential figure in the Houston hip hop community and was the leader of Houston's [[Screwed Up Click]].

Davis released over 350 mixtapes and was recognized as an innovator mostly on a regional level until his death of [[codeine]] overdose in 2000.<ref name="nyt">{{cite web|last1=Strauss|first1=Neil|title=THE POP LIFE; Rap Is Slower Around Houston|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/23/arts/the-pop-life-rap-is-slower-around-houston.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref> His legacy was discovered by a wider audience around 2005, and has gone on to influence a wide variety of artists.

==Early life==
Robert Earl Davis, Jr. was born in [[Smithville, Texas]]. His father, Robert Earl Davis Sr., was a long-haul truck driver based in Houston. His mother Ida May Deary (who had a young daughter from a previous marriage), came to the area to be with her mother when her son was born in 1971. She returned to Houston, but the marriage was floundering; soon it would be over, and she and her kids moved to [[Los Angeles]] for a couple of years, then back to Houston, and returned to Smithville in 1980 when Davis was age nine.<ref name=TheSlowLifeandFastDeathofDJScrew />

When young, DJ Screw had aspirations of being a truck driver like his father, but seeing the 1984 hit [[break dancing]] movie ''[[Breakin']]'' and discovering his mother's [[phonograph|turntable]] attracted him to music. His admiration of classical music drove him to resume piano lessons. After seven years of practice, he was able to play works like Chopin's Etude in C major by ear. His musical interest shifted as he took his mother's [[B.B. King]] and [[Johnnie Taylor]] records and [[scratching|scratch]]ed them on the turntable the way DJs did, slowing the spinning disc and then allowing it to speed back up, playing with sound.

Davis began buying records of his own and would spin with his friend Trey Adkins, who would rhyme. "Screw had a jam box and he hooked up two turntables to it and made a fader out of the radio tuner so he could deejay." Adkins said if Robert Earl didn't like a record, he would deface it with a screw. One day Adkins asked him, "Who do you think you are, DJ Screw?" Robert Earl liked the sound of that and, in turn, gave his long-time friend a new name: Shorty Mac.<ref name=TheSlowLifeandFastDeathofDJScrew>{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Michael|title=The Slow Life and Fast Death of DJ Screw|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/slow-life-and-fast-death-dj-screw?fullpage=1|publisher=Texas Monthly}}</ref>

==Career==

{{quotebox|
|text="The results of D.J. Screw's labors often sound like rap records played underwater on an old cassette deck that's running out of batteries and needs its tape heads cleaned. It is not music to dance to but music to lose yourself in, as if it is the last sound echoing in your head as you drift off to sleep."<ref name="nyt"/>

Davis began DJing at age 12 in 1983, and started his trademark slowed-down mixes in 1990, the style became his main focus in late 1991 – early 1992. The mixes began as special compilations requested by friends and those in the know. He soon made them available for sale when his close friend Toe offered to buy a mix from him for ten dollars. At that point, customers had increasingly begun requesting his more well-known mixes instead of personalized lists. During the early 1990s, he invited some of the Houston MCs from the city's south side to rhyme on those mixes.<ref name="Flashing Back to the Heyday of DJ Screw">[http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2009/07/flashing_back_to_the_heyday_of.php Flashing Back to the Heyday of DJ Screw]. [[Houston Press]]. July 2009.</ref> This coalition of emcees eventually became the fathers of the [[Screwed Up Click]]. Many members of the [[Screwed Up Click]], or S.U.C., are considered key figures in the canon of Houston hip hop. The original lineup included [[Big Hawk]], [[Big Moe]], [[E.S.G. (rapper)|E.S.G.]], and [[Fat Pat (rapper)|Fat Pat]], among others. The crew later gained then upcoming artists such as, [[Z-Ro]], [[Trae tha Truth]] as well as Lil Flip.<ref>[[Screwed Up Click]]</ref> His career began to advance once he met Russell Washington of BigTyme Recordz and signed to the label.

Davis later moved to a house in the 7600 block of Greenstone Street near [[Gulfgate Mall]]. Fans, some driving from far away areas such as [[Dallas]] and [[Waco]], lined up at his door to obtain his recordings. He started his own business and opened a shop up on 7717 Cullen Blvd in Houston, TX, called Screwed Up Records and Tapes. It has been shown in numerous music videos and documentaries as well as independent films. In the early 2010s, this location closed. It has since been relocated to 3538 West Fuqua, Houston, TX. Fans may also purchase merchandise, including mixtapes, on the [http://screweduprecords.com/ S.U.C. website].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/OriginalSUC/|title=Original S.U.C. Facebook}}</ref> There are now several Screwed Up Records and Tapes spread out through Texas, including one in Beaumont and in Austin.<ref name=TheSlowLifeandFastDeathofDJScrew />

==Death and legacy==
On November 16, 2000, Davis was found dead inside of his Houston recording studio in the 8100 block of Commerce Park Drive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Autopsy-shows-codeine-overdose-killed-DJ-Screw-2004303.php|title=Autopsy shows codeine overdose killed DJ Screw|first=Allan|last=Turner|date=Jan 8, 2001|website=Houston Chronicle|access-date=Jun 10, 2020}}</ref> Fans speculated about the true cause of his death.<ref name="Life in the Slow Lane">[http://www.houstonpress.com/2001-01-18/news/life-in-the-slow-lane/3/ Life in the Slow Lane]. [[Houston Press]]. December 18, 2001.</ref> When the coroner reports were released, they confirmed that he died of a [[codeine]] overdose in addition to mixed drug intoxication. The codeine came from a prescription-strength cough syrup that he would mix with soda to make [[Lean (drug)|lean ("purple drank")]]. In addition to codeine, [[Valium]] and [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] were found in his blood.<ref name="TheSlowLifeandFastDeathofDJScrew"/> His funeral took place at Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church in his hometown of [[Smithville, Texas]].<ref name="TheSlowLifeandFastDeathofDJScrew"/>

DJ Screw has been a considerable influence in the Houston scene and beyond, "helping to cement his legacy as an underappreciated [[avant-garde|avant-gardist]], creator of a ''sui generis'' sound that’s still growing and mutating."<ref name="slowly">{{cite web|last1=Caramanica|first1=Jon|title=Seeping Out of Houston, Slowly|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/arts/music/07witch.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref> Texas governor [[Rick Perry]] honored him by making him an official ''Texas Music Pioneer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gov.texas.gov/music|title=Home|website=gov.texas.gov|access-date=Jun 10, 2020}}</ref> [[Houston Press|The Houston Press]] named the 1995 album ''[[3 'n the Mornin' (Part Two)]]'' as no. 13 on its list of the 25 best Houston rap albums of all time,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/the-h-town-countdown-no-13-dj-screws-3-n-tha-mornin-pt-2-blue-6757896|title=The H-Town Countdown, No. 13: DJ Screw's 3 N' Tha Mornin' Pt. 2 (Blue)|first=Shea|last=Serrano|date=Oct 29, 2009|website=Houston Press|access-date=Jun 10, 2020}}</ref> crediting the release for the way it helped shape Houston's hip-hop culture.  When the Houston hip-hop scene became nationally prominent in 2004, many of the biggest acts could be traced to DJ Screw's crew, the Screwed Up Click.  Many artists outside of Houston rap have been influenced by Screw's work, including [[experimental music|experimental electronic]] artists such as [[Oneohtrix Point Never]], [[Balam Acab]], [[How to Dress Well]],<ref name="slowly"/> and [[Rabit (musician)|Rabit]].

The genre shown by DJ Screw has since evolved into a Houston-based subculture that is associated with the recreational consumption of [[codeine]], opulent jewelry and elaborate vintage vehicles. Screw has also left behind a cult following of listeners who self-identify as "screwheads". A music festival and car show in honor of DJ Screw was set up in 2006. The inaugural DJ Screwfest featured 200 vehicles and a set list featuring notable Houston hip-hop acts like Trae and Chingo Bling. The first festival took place at the Pasadena County Fairgrounds. The 2007 documentary film ''Screwed In Houston'', produced by ''VBS/[[Vice Magazine]]'', details the history of the Houston hip hop scene and the influence of the chopped and screwed sub-culture on Houston hip hop. The 5-part series devotes one full episode to DJ Screw and includes video footage of him days before his death. The [[University of Houston]] Libraries ''Houston Hip Hop Research Collection'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libraries.uh.edu/locations/special-collections/houston-hip-hop/|title=Houston Hip Hop Research Collection &#124; University of Houston Libraries|first=UH Libraries Web|last=Services|access-date=Jun 10, 2020}}</ref> includes the ''DJ Screw Papers'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://findingaids.lib.uh.edu/|title=Finding Aids &#124; University of Houston Libraries|website=findingaids.lib.uh.edu|access-date=Jun 10, 2020}}</ref> including approximately 1500 vinyl records owned by DJ Screw, original DJ Screw recordings, photographs, handwritten track lists, and more. Some of these materials have been digitized. In July 2019, [[University of Texas Press]] announced that ''Houston Rap Tapes'' author Lance Scott Walker was writing a book about DJ Screw to be published in spring 2022. In January 2020, the biopic ''All Screwed Up'' was revealed, detailing the life and events that DJ Screw went through. In December 2020, Sony announced that the film is in development, with Isaac Yowman directing. No date for release has been announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2020/12/sony-to-develop-isaac-yowman-biopic-based-dj-screw/|title=Sony to Develop Isaac Yowman-Helmed Biopic Based on DJ Screw|publisher=Complex Magazine|date=December 19, 2020|access-date=January 24, 2021|author=FNR TIGG}}</ref>
