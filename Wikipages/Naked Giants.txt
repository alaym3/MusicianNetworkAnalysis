==History==
===2014–2017: Formation and ''R.I.P.''===
Grant Mullen and Henry LaVallee met in pre-school. In their teenage years they took up practicing music together and discovered they had musical chemistry. At 17 or 18, the duo decided to pursue music together and create the band.  Naked Giants had their first practice in August, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJpSo0oSmnE&t=112s |title=Art Zone: Naked Giants perform 'Everybody Thinks They Know (But No One Really Knows)' |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>  Gianni was part of a synthpop band called ''Laser Fox'' at the time, playing bass for the group. LaVallee and Mullen discovered Aiello at a live performance at [[the Crocodile]] cafe in Seattle. According to Aiello, "they thought I looked really cool, and they liked my moves, and they said I could play the bass really well." He was then invited to perform with them in [[Mercer Island, Washington|Mercer Island]], and joined the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWnbF32K3Xc&t=797s |title=Naked Giants - Episode 321 - Band in Seattle |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> They released their first single ''Easy Eating'' in 2016, followed by three more prior to the release of the ''R.I.P.'' EP, distributed via Miscreant Records. The EP was well received by Andi Villegas of North West Music Scene.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andi Villegas |url=http://www.northwestmusicscene.net/review-naked-giants-rip-ep/ |title=Review: Naked Giants Exceed Expectations on 'R.I.P.' EP |website=Northwestmusicscene.net |date=2016-10-14 |access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> After finishing second in the Sound Off! music competition in Emerald City, Naked Giants became a member of [[New West Records]] and started work on their debut studio album.

===2017–2020: ''SLUFF'', touring, and ''Green Fuzz''===
In 2017, Naked Giants collaborated with fellow New Records signee [[Ron Gallo]] on his 7" single ''Sorry Not Everybody Is You/The Age of Information.'' Their debut album, ''SLUFF'' was produced by [[Steve Fisk]], who had previously worked with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Car Seat Headrest]]. On the direction for ''SLUFF'', Mullen said "it's a smorgasbord of shit. Loud rock music, that's what it is." Aiello spoke of the project, "it's that kind of thing where you make something and you don't really know what it is, but you understand it later."<ref>{{cite web|last=Burns |first=Chase |url=http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2018/03/29/25968068/a-smorgasbord-of-shit-naked-giants-on-their-debut-album-sluff |title="A Smorgasbord of Shit": Naked Giants on Their Debut Album, SLUFF - Slog |website=Thestranger.com |date=2018-03-29 |access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> Despite interpretations that SLUFF stands for [[Lake Washington|South Lake]] Union Fuck Faces, Naked Giants state that is only one view. "Sluff" can also be "either slang for the black gunk that comes off your shoes when it snows in the winter, ... or what a snake does when it sheds its skin" according to different members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nakedgiants.com/ |title=Naked Giants |website=Nakedgiants.com |access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>

The album was released on March 30, 2018, and included twelve tracks. The first single released off of the album was "TV", which was accompanied by a music video directed by Sean Downey and released on the New West Records [[YouTube]] channel. Their second single was "Everybody Thinks They Know (But No One Really Knows)", and the third single was the titular track "SLUFF". The album dabbles with [[blues]] on the song "Slow Dance II", and in themes of duality and [[gender identity]] on the closer track "Shredded Again."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kexp.org/read/2018/3/29/throwaway-style-naked-giants-make-emotional-stress-sound-thrilling-isluffi/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401144642/http://kexp.org/read/2018/3/29/throwaway-style-naked-giants-make-emotional-stress-sound-thrilling-isluffi/ |archive-date=2018-04-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Naked Giants went on tour with [[Car Seat Headrest]] performing both their own songs and Car Seat Headrest's in a seven-man set.

According to Henry LaVallee, "The Green Fuzz EP concept was to give a few of our longer songs a platform to exist that would be something excellent to own as a 10".<ref>{{cite web|author=Dean Brandt |url=http://www.floodmagazine.com/56558/premiere-naked-giants-show-off-their-long-game-on-green-fuzz-ep/ |title=FLOOD &#124; PREMIERE: Naked Giants Show Off Their Long Game on "Green Fuzz" EP |website=Floodmagazine.com |date=2019-01-24 |access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> On 17 July, 2019, Naked Giants released a music video for the song ''Green Fuzz'' with a plot revolving around three students attempting to solve the mystery of several missing students and a Green Fuzz monster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkE3atPRqG0 |title=Naked Giants - "Green Fuzz" [Official Video |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> In 2018, Naked Giants stated that they are already working on demos and takes for a new album. In the interview for ANCHR Magazine, Aiello stated that they had already completed 9 demos for a sophomore album. Aiello said that the second studio album would try to refine what was done well on ''SLUFF'' and that the album was about "realizing ... where you are in the world and how you fit into [the] balance of oppression and privilege and how to navigate that and navigate your own anxiety of these things you internalize."<ref>{{cite web|last=Noel |first=Alyssa |url=https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/naked-giants-continue-to-grow/Content?oid=14246929 |title=Naked Giants continue to grow &#124; Music &#124; Pique Newsmagazine &#124; Whistler, CANADA |website=Piquenewsmagazine.com |access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>

===2020-Present: ''The Shadow'', second album===
On 11 June 2020, Naked Giants released their lead single from their second studio album ''The Shadow'' produced by [[Chris Funk]], with a [[socially distanced]] music video due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The song was described by the band as representing the "dance-the-stress-away attitude we’ve had since the band was formed" and that the song's lyrics are meant to represent the "big unanswered questions in our lives, like the mechanisms of privilege and oppression or the capitalist oxymoron of individualism and assimilation, and we’re pairing it all with a danceable backbeat to tell people it’s ok to get up off the couch and do something about it." They also describe ''The Shadow'' as "a much more honest album than SLUFF" about the "part of yourself that’s hard to confront and understand" and "facing that darkness and having the strength to bring it into the light."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2020/06/naked-giants-announce-new-album-share-first-single-take-a-chance/ |title=Naked Giants Announce New Album, Share First Single ‘Take a Chance’|access-date=2020-06-14}}</ref> Aiello said that many of the songs on ''The Shadow'' had been brewing for a long time, and that they "leaned  into our ’80s and ’90s influences for this record. We took a lot of inspiration from bands like [[Devo]], [[The Cure]], [[U2]], [[Talking Heads]], [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], and [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], as well as our usual sources like [[Neil Young]], [[Black Sabbath]], and all that classic stuff." Aiello also said that [[Chris Funk]] was an important part of the creative process, suggesting taking away Henry's cymbals on some songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/naked-giants-the-shadow/|title=Naked Giants on the making of their highly-anticipated album, ‘The Shadow’|access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref> In an interview with [[American Songwriter]] upon releasing their single ''The Shadow'', the members stated they spent more of their time during the pandemic [[music education|teaching  children music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/the-shadow-naked-giants-song-premiere/|title=Naked Giants Bring Live Rock Energy To New Release, “The Shadow”|access-date=2021-04-22}}</ref> Their second album, ''The Shadow'' released on August 21st, 2020.

Critics noted the album's more diverse sound including more stylistic influences from [[Mudhoney]], and [[post-punk]] influences a la [[Joy Division]] on songs like ''Turns Blue'', ''[[Jack the Ripper|The Ripper]]'', and ''Unpeeled''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2020/08/21/naked-giants-the-shadow-album-review/|title=Naked Giants – The Shadow (Album Review)|access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref> Other influences noted by critics were [[The Ramones]] and [[The Talking Heads]]. The album has been received positively. Maeri Ferguson of [[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] notes that ''Turns Blue'' "is a standout, unexpectedly knocking the wind out of you with its silken vocals and air of solitude that feels fitting for a time of unprecedented loneliness and isolation," and that the trio "use their harmonies strategically, sometimes mono and hypnotic to work you into a trance, other times primal and deeply felt, like a long-awaited release of tension."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nodepression.com/album-reviews/rockers-naked-giants-find-quieter-moments-on-the-shadow/|title=Rockers Naked Giants Find Quieter Moments on ‘The Shadow’|access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref> Jeremy Lukens of ''Glide Magazine'' wrote that ''The Shadow'' was more melodic than ''SLUFF'' and, whilst having a "slightly overproduced pop sheen detracting from the band’s primal nature," that ''The Shadow'' "deftly blends Naked Giants’ influences of early-2000s garage rock with 1990s alternative. Lukens also found the eponymous song ''The Shadow'' to be the highlight of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://glidemagazine.com/247361/naked-giants-offers-fresh-fierce-collection-of-unrestrained-rock-on-the-shadow-album-review/|title=NAKED GIANTS BRING FRESH & FIERCE COLLECTION OF UNRESTRAINED ROCK ON ‘THE SHADOW’ (ALBUM REVIEW)|access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref> Michael Rietmulder of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' described the album as "glammy, synth-squiggling dance rock and a stoner rock leg-stretcher that sets up hazy, dream-pop send-off 'Song For When You Sleep' — all sprinkled across an album that never feels too scatterbrained."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/seattle-garage-rockers-naked-giants-grow-up-on-sophomore-album-the-shadow/|title=Seattle garage rockers Naked Giants grow up on sophomore album ‘The Shadow’|access-date=2021-02-20}}</ref> ''The Shadow'' made numerous Seattle music journalists and critics' year end lists for best 2020 Seattle albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/music/best-seattle-albums-of-2020-the-critics-ballots/|title=Best Seattle albums of 2020: the critics’ ballots|access-date=2021-02-20}}</ref>
