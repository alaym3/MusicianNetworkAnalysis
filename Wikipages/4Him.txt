'''4Him''' was a [[contemporary Christian music|Contemporary Christian]] group founded in 1990 in [[Mobile, Alabama]], US. The group has ten [[GMA Dove Awards|Dove awards]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination and three certified gold albums to their credit. The group was inducted into Alabama's Music Hall of Fame, following the awarding of The Governor’s Achievement Award. The group has also been featured performers for popular Christian Evangelist crusaders, [[Billy Graham]] and [[Luis Palau]].

4Him disbanded in 2006 to pursue individual careers of ministry and music. They have released 12 studio albums which have produced 27 number one singles.

The group has made sporadic reunion appearances since 2009.

==History==
[[Andy Chrisman]], [[Mark Harris (musician)|Mark Harris]], Marty Magehee, and Kirk Sullivan originally met when they sang together in [[Truth (American band)|Truth]], a [[Contemporary Christian]] vocal group founded in the late 1960s and directed by [[Roger Breland]]. Truth had a rotating roster of four male and four female vocalists. After three representatives from [[Benson Records]] attended several Truth concerts in the late 1980s during which Andy, Mark, Marty, and Kirk performed, Benson approached the quartet saying that they wanted to use the guys to create a new male four-member vocal group under the Benson label. "Where There Is Faith", their first single, stayed at No. 1 on the charts for eight weeks, two months before 4Him left Truth. Releasing their self-titled debut in 1990, they blended the traditions of [[Christian music]]'s past, with modern pop production and practical lyrics.

In 1996, with the release of ''The Message'', 4Him changed their overall sound in an effort to keep pushing the creative limits of the group. The guys replaced the over-the-top orchestrations and choral vocal arrangements with a stripped down, acoustic band approach where one of the guys would sing lead and the other three would sing backing vocals. On 1998’s ''Obvious'', each member took more ownership of their music – becoming more involved in the production and songwriting aspects.

By 2004, all four of the guys reevaluated the future of the ministry. After close to seventeen years together, the members of 4Him decided to embark on solo careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4him.net|title=4Him|work=4him.net}}</ref> On September 23, 2006, they performed their final concert at Cottage Hill Baptist Church in [[Mobile, AL]], the city where 4Him’s 17-year journey first started. At that concert, various individuals (including family members, record producers, management, and Truth founder Roger Breland) were recognized for their contributions to 4Him’s ministry.
