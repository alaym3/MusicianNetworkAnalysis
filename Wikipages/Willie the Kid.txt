'''Willie the Kid''' (foaled 1937 in [[Ontario]]) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] best known for winning the eighty-first running of the [[Queen's Plate|King's Plate]], Canada's most important race.

Bred by [[William F. Morrissey|Willie Morrissey]], Willie the Kid got his owner's nickname. He was out of the mare Mintwina, who was also the dam of Morrissey's [[Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Bunty Lawless]]. He was sired by [[Roselyon]] who had sired the 1930 King's Plate winner, [[Aymond]]. Roselyon was a son of the 1911 [[Epsom Derby]] winner and [[British Horseracing Hall of Fame]] inductee, [[Sunstar (racehorse)|Sunstar]].

Willie the Kid raced under the name of Willie Morrissey's  girlfriend, Miss Mildred A. Kane. Trained by [[Gordon J. McCann|Gordon McCann]], the oft-injured colt did not race at age two but as a three-year-old won three times in ten starts. In the May 18, 1940 [[Queen's Plate|King's Plate]] he beat a field that included [[Curwen]], the [[Harry C. Hatch|Harry Hatch]]-owned colt who had been sent off as the [[Parimutuel betting|betting]] favorite. The victory marked the first time a female owner won the Plate, and it was the first of six career Plate wins for trainer Gordon McCann.

In the ensuing [[Prince of Wales Stakes]], Willie the Kid again beat third-place finisher Curwen but was second to race winner, [[Hood (horse)|Hood]]. Willie the Kid came out of the race with an injury that ended his racing career. He was retired to [[Stud (animal)|stud]] duty but was not a success.
