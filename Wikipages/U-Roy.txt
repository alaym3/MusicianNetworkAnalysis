In 1970, Jamaican singer [[John Holt (singer)|John Holt]] (lead vocalist of [[the Paragons]]) heard Beckford toasting over a [[Duke Reid]] track at a dance.

Beckford then went on to work with other major producers on the island including [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]], [[Bunny Lee]], [[Phil Pratt]], [[Sonia Pottinger]], [[Rupie Edwards]], [[Alvin Ranglin]] and [[Lloyd Daley]]. 1971 saw the release of Beckford's Deejay version of The Paragons' "[[The Tide Is High]]".

===U-Roy's music and Rastafari===
[[Rastafari]] has been a feature of Beckford's lyrics from his earliest singles to his latest album ''Pray Fi Di People''. Beckford's second single "Rightful Ruler" (1969) opens with a profession of Rastafari faith given in the Ethiopian language [[Amharic language|Amharic]]:

<blockquote><poem>
Kibir amlak (Glory to Jah)
Qedamawi ras fetari (First creator)
Qedamawi iyesus kristos (Holy Jesus Christ)
Lebdama mabrak isad
Tenayistilgn (Greetings)
</poem></blockquote>

Beckford's "Joyful Locks" (1975) is a DJ version of [[Linval Thompson]]'s "Don't Cut Off Your Dreadlocks"; an encouragement to others to keep their dreadlocks and to "let it grow". The original song and Beckford's DJ version both allude to the biblical [[Samson]] who as a Nazarite was expected to make certain religious vows including the ritual treatment of his hair as described in Chapter Six of the [[Book of Numbers]]:<ref name="Mahddy2014">{{cite book|author=Rasta Mahddy|title=Reggae Vibe Summer Issue: Reggae Vibe Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BbJLBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT30|date=1 August 2014|publisher=Reggae Vibe Magazine|pages=30–|access-date=19 February 2021|archive-date=21 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210221195420/https://books.google.com/books?id=BbJLBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT30|url-status=live}}</ref>

<blockquote>All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
</blockquote>

==Death==
Beckford's death was confirmed on 17 February 2021 when his partner, Marcia Smikle, told the Jamaican newspaper ''[[The Gleaner]]''. [[Trojan Records]] was also informed about his death. As of 20 February, no cause of death has been made public, although he suffered from diabetes, hypertension, and problems with his kidneys prior to his death, and had been undergoing surgery at the hospital.<ref>{{cite news|last=Amorosi|first=A.

==Legacy==
Beckford was preceded by the toasters [[Count Matchuki]], [[King Stitt]] and [[Sir Lord Comic]] who themselves were influenced by the ''[[jive talk]]'' of the US [[disc jockeys]] that they heard on American radio stations whose broadcasts reached the Caribbean. Beckford was the first toaster to popularize the form through a series of successful releases on the Duke Reid label gaining a wider audience for toasting. This approach to production and the remixing of previously recorded tracks with a new vocal influenced the early [[hip-hop]] pioneers.<ref name="NYT">{{cite web |last1=Genzlinger |first1=Neil |title=U-Roy, Whose 'Toasting' Transformed Jamaican Music, Dies at 78 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/arts/music/u-roy-dead.html |website=[[New York Times]] |access-date=23 February 2021 |date=19 February 2021}}</ref> [[Kool Herc]] states:

<blockquote>"Hip-hop….the whole chemistry of that came from Jamaica…..In Jamaica all you needed was a drum and a bass. So what I did was go right to the ‘yoke’. I cut off all the anticipation and just played the beats. I’d find out where the break in the record was and prolonged it and people would love it. So I was giving them their own taste and beat percussion wise….cause my music is all about heavy bass."<ref>[http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/board.html Reggae’s Impact on Hip-Hop – Jamie Ann Board (UVM Debate Paper – 17 April 2000).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121172556/http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/board.html |date=21 January 2012 }} Retrieved 22 April 2013</ref></blockquote>
