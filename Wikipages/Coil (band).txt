'''Coil''' were an [[experimental music]] group, founded in 1982 in [[London]], England and concluded in 2005. Initially envisioned as a solo project by musician [[John Balance]] (of the band [[Psychic TV]]), Coil evolved into a full-time project with the addition of his partner [[Peter Christopherson]] (formerly of pioneering [[industrial music]] group [[Throbbing Gristle]]). Balance and Christopherson were the only constant members; other contributors throughout the band's career included [[Stephen Thrower]], [[Danny Hyde]], [[Drew McDowall]], [[William Breeze]], [[Thighpaulsandra]], and [[Ossian Brown]]. Coil's work explored themes related to [[alchemy]], [[the occult]], and [[sexuality]], influencing genres such as [[goth rock]], [[neofolk]], and [[dark ambient]].<ref name="Bio"/> [[AllMusic]] called the group "one of the most beloved, mythologized groups to emerge from the British [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]] scene."<ref name="Bio"/>

After the release of their 1984 debut EP ''[[How to Destroy Angels (Coil EP)|How to Destroy Angels]]'', Coil joined [[Some Bizzare Records]], through which they released two full-length albums, ''[[Scatology (album)|Scatology]]'' (1984) and ''[[Horse Rotorvator]]'' (1986). After departing from Some Bizzare, Coil had established their own record label, [[Threshold House]], through which they produced and released ''[[Love's Secret Domain]]'' (1991). Financial difficulties slowed the group's work in the early 1990s before they returned to the project on releases such as ''[[Astral Disaster]]'' (1999), and the ''Musick to Play in the Dark'' series  composed of ''[[Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 1|Vol. 1]]'' (1999) and ''[[Musick to Play in the Dark Vol. 2|Vol. 2]]'' (2000), as well as releasing several projects under aliases such as Black Light District, ELpH, and Time Machines.<ref name="Bio">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/coil-mn0000105561/biography|title=Coil {{!}} Biography & History|last1=Ankeny|first1=Jason|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|access-date=15 January 2018}}</ref>

The group started several smaller independent [[record labels]], including [[Eskaton]] and [[Chalice (record label)|Chalice]]. In 1985, the group began working on a series of soundtracks, among them the [[The Unreleased Themes for Hellraiser|rejected score]] for the first ''[[Hellraiser]]''. The group's first live performance in 16 years occurred in 1999, and began a series of mini-tours that would last until 2004.<ref name="Brainwashed Live Archive">{{cite web|url = http://www.brainwashed.com/coil/live/|title = Live Archive| work= [[Brainwashed (website)|Brainwashed]]

In 1978, John Balance (born Geoff[rey] Burton; also known as Rushton, by his stepfather's surname) was a teenage zine journalist, writing—along with his schoolmate Tom Craig, a grandson of [[Edward Carrick]] and grand-grandson of [[Edward Gordon Craig]]—under a moniker ''[[Stabmental]]'', through which he published the articles on UK underground artists, including seminal [[industrial music|industrial bands]] [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Keenan|2003|p=29}}; {{Harvnb|Reynolds|2005|p=481}}; {{harvnb|Reed|2013|p=143}}.</ref> A Throbbing Gristle fan, Balance had contacted them via mail, and thus befriended the Throbbing Gristle frontperson [[Genesis P-Orridge]].<ref>{{harvnb|Keenan|2003|pp=37–38}}; {{harvnb|Reed|2013|p=143}}.</ref> In February 1980, Balance had attended a Throbbing Gristle gig recorded and released as ''[[Heathen Earth]]'', where he had first met P-Orridge's bandmate [[Peter Christopherson]] and befriended him as well.{{sfn|Keenan|2003|p=37}}

Following the dissolution of Throbbing Gristle in 1981, P-Orridge, Christopherson, and [[Alex Fergusson (musician)|Alex Fergusson]] (formerly of [[Alternative TV]]) went on to form the new project, titled [[Psychic TV]], along with the accompanying fellowship titled [[Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth]].{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=167}} Balance, who had attended the [[University of Sussex]] for a short time and participated in Brian Williams' [[Lustmord]] project,<ref name="Unsound_Vol. 1_Issue 5"/> returned in London to live with Christopherson—with whom a romantic partnership had begun.<ref>{{harvnb|Keenan|2003|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Reynolds|2005|p=475}}.</ref> As a Psychic TV member, Balance participated in the recording of the single "Just Drifting" (from the album ''[[Force the Hand of Chance]]'') and, the following year, of the album ''[[Dreams Less Sweet]]''.{{sfn|Keenan|2003|p=43}}

Already having an experience of performing and recording previous to his tenure in Psychic TV, Balance went on to use the name Coil in 1982, originally envisioned for a solo project.<ref name="Scatology liner notes">{{cite AV media notes|title=Scatology|medium=vinyl disc|others=Coil|publisher=Force And Form|location=London|id=FFK1|year=1984|quote=The name 'Coil', first used by John Balance in Autumn 1982 for his solo works, now represents him in collaboration with Peter Christopherson.}}</ref><ref name="Bio"/><ref>{{harvnb|Neal|1987|p=116}}; {{harvnb|Gossling|2003|p=215}}; {{harvnb|Reed|2013|p=143}}.</ref> In 1983, Balance wrote a manifesto titled ''The Price of Existence Is Eternal Warfare'' and sent a tape of the song "On Balance", dated 5 May 1982,<ref name="LOCI CD13">{{cite AV media notes|title=Transparent|others=Zos Kia / Coil|year=1997|orig-year=1984|publisher=Threshold House|id=LOCI CD13|type=liner notes}}</ref> to Gary Levermore's label [[Third Mind Records]] for an inclusion on a compilation album ''Rising From The Red Sand''; Levermore, however, had rejected the track.{{sfn|Keenan|2003|p=101}} Despite this, Balance had recorded three more new tracks—"S for Sleep", "Red Weather", and "Here to Here (Double-Headed Secret)"—on 11 May 1983.<ref name="The Feverish 3"/><ref>{{harvnb|Sanders|Gaffney|1987|p=I}}; {{harvnb|Keenan|2003|p=101}}.</ref> On 4 August 1983, Coil—as the duo of Balance and Christopherson—had played its first gig in London at the Magenta Club, during a screening of films by [[Cerith Wyn Evans]] and [[Derek Jarman]].<ref name="The Feverish 3">{{citation |title=The Feverish|issue=3|date=1985-04-09|df=mdy-all|access-date=2018-02-12|via=''Brainwashed'' archive|url=http://brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/publications/coil-1985-the-feverish-3.pdf}}</ref>{{sfn|Keenan|2003|p=101}} Since Christopherson's commitments for Psychic TV—in which he had become disillusioned due to growing conflict with P-Orridge—still limited his participation in Coil, Balance approached [[John Gosling (Psychic TV musician)|John Gosling]]—also Psychic TV member who fronted his own project [[Zos Kia]]—to work with. Balance's and Gosling's collaboration resulted in the next three gigs during 1983, with the last one being performed in December on Berlin Atonal festival, where Balance participated as both Psychic TV and Coil member.

===1984–1986: ''How to Destroy Angels'' and Some Bizzare years===
The band's official recording debut, an extended play titled ''[[How to Destroy Angels (Coil EP)|How to Destroy Angels]]'', was released on the [[Good Friday]] (20 April) of 1984 by a Belgian-based label L.A.Y.L.A.H.

Shortly after in May 1984, Coil went on to record their first full-length studio album, eventually titled ''[[Scatology (album)|Scatology]]'', approaching [[JG Thirlwell]] as a co-producer and co-composer;<ref name="AbrAhAdAbrA">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/No01Abrahadabra/abrahadabra01#page/n17/mode/2up|language=nl|title=Coil Interview: The Price of Existence is Eternal Warfare|magazine=AbrAhAdAbrA|issue=1|date=23 January 1985|access-date=19 May 2017|via=Internet Archive|postscript=.

''Scatology'' was released in early 1985 with a 1984 copyright date by the band's own label, Force & Form, and K.422 (a [[Some Bizzare Records]] sublabel), to mainly positive feedback. Shortly after, a single featuring a remix of "[[Panic/Tainted Love|Panic]]" and a cover of "[[Tainted Love]]" was released, with the profits being donated to the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]];<ref>{{cite web|last=Vague|first=Tom|title=Boys From The Crap Stuff|url=http://www.brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/publications/coil-1985-zigzag.php?site=coil08|publisher=ZigZag Magazine|access-date=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bey|Bailey|2012|p=103}}; {{harvnb|Aston|2016|p=366}}.</ref> hailed since then as the first AIDS benefit music release, it was supported with the "Tainted Love" video directed by Christopherson, which was purchased by [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, U.S.<ref name="Lust's Dark Exit">{{cite news | url=http://www.brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/publications/coil-1991-lusts_dark_exit.php?site=coil08 | title=Lust's Dark Exit | work=Electric Dark Space | year=1991 |access-date=19 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="NME 1985">{{Cite magazine | last =Kopf | first = Biba | title = The Soil And Spoil Tactics Of Coil | magazine = NME | date = 20 April 1985 }}</ref><ref name="Option Coil ’92"/><ref>{{harvnb|Neal|1987|p=116}}; {{harvnb|Gossling|2003|p=215}}; {{harvnb|Keenan|2003|p=127}}; {{harvnb|Diesel|Gerten|2007|p=157}}.</ref><ref name="Bio"/>

''Horse Rotorvator'' followed in 1986 as the next full-length release. Although songs such as "The Anal Staircase" and "Circles of Mania" sound like evolved versions of ''Scatology'' material, the album is characterized by slower tempos, and represented a new direction for the group. The album has a darker theme than previous releases, according to Balance:

<blockquote>
Horse Rotorvator was this vision I'd had of this mechanical/flesh thing that ploughed up the earth and I really did have a vision of it—a real horrible, burning, dripping, jaw-like vision in the night ... The [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] killed their horses and use their jawbones to make this huge earth-moving machine."<ref name="The Wire 175">{{cite magazine|last=Keenan|first=David|date=September 1998|title=Time Out of Joint|issue=175|url=https://archive.org/details/the-wire-magazine-1998-09-cbz/page/n47|work=The Wire|pages=48–53|via=the Internet Archive|issn=0952-0686}}</ref></blockquote>

===''Gold Is the Metal...'' and ''Unnatural History'' (1986–1990)===
After the release of ''Horse Rotorvator'', Coil left Some Bizzare Records, since they fell out with its owner [[Stevo Pearce]].{{sfn|Reed|2013|p=144}} ''[[Gold Is the Metal (With the Broadest Shoulders)]]'' followed as a full-length release in 1987, marking the beginning of the band's own label, [[Threshold House]]—the album is described in the liner notes as "not the follow-up to ''Horse Rotorvator'', but a completely separate package&nbsp;– a stopgap and a breathing space – the space between two twins", which refers to ''Horse Rotorvator'' and ''Love's Secret Domain''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coil – Gold Is The Metal (With The Broadest Shoulders)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Coil-Gold-Is-The-Metal-With-The-Broadest-Shoulders/release/194181|website=Coil on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=4 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref>

The 13-track ''Unnatural History'' compilation was then released on Threshold House in 1990. The first three songs on the album were first released as one half of the ''Nightmare Culture'' mini-album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coil – Unnatural History (Compilation Tracks Compiled)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Coil-Unnatural-History-Compilation-Tracks-Compiled/release/3652115|website=Coil on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=4 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref>

===''Love's Secret Domain'' (1991–1992)===
''Love's Secret Domain'' (abbreviated ''LSD'') followed in 1991 as the next "proper" Coil album, although a few minor releases had been produced since ''Horse Rotorvator''. ''LSD'' represents a progression in Coil's style and became a template for what would be representative of [[List of post-industrial music genres and related fusion genres|newer waves of post-industrial music]], blended with their own style of [[acid house]].<ref name="Liar Society">{{cite web|url = http://liarsociety.tripod.com/blog/index.blog?from=20041130|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206210600/http://liarsociety.tripod.com/blog/index.blog?from=20041130|archive-date = 6 February 2008|title = Coil: Scatology, Horse Rotorvator, Love's Secret Domain| publisher = Liar Society|date=2004-10-30|access-date=12 February 2007}}</ref> Although the album was more upbeat, it was not intended as a dance record, as Christopherson explained "I wouldn't say it's a party atmosphere, but it's more positive."<ref name="Alternative Press, Issue 38"/><ref name="La Stampa">{{cite web

===Soundtracks and side projects (1993–1998)===
Coil separated their works into many [[side project]]s, publishing music under different names and a variety of styles. The pre-Coil aliases, Zos Kia and Sickness of Snakes, formed the foundation of a style that would evolve to characterize their initial wave of releases.

Before embarking on their second wave of side projects and pseudonyms, Coil created a soundtrack for the movie ''[[Hellraiser]]'', although they withdrew from the project when they suspected their music would not be used.<ref name="Compulsion, Number 1"/> Furthermore, Coil claimed inspiration for [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] was partly drawn from the piercing magazines that director Barker borrowed from the group.<ref name="Compulsion, Number 1"/> Balance explained after the release of ''Stolen and Contaminated Songs'', in around 1992:

<blockquote>
Yeah it would have been brilliant but we wouldn’t have carried on, because they were changing everything and they weren’t being very nice to us, the actual film people. They were keeping us in the dark a lot. We said we’d had enough just at the same time they decided they wanted to use Howard Shore. They just wanted normal film music. They didn’t want anything too scary which is sad and ridiculous for a horror film.<ref name="Con">{{cite web|title=Coil: An interview with John Balance|author=Tony Dickie|url=http://www.compulsiononline.com/interview_coil.htm|work=Compulsion|access-date=4 January 2015|date=1992}}</ref></blockquote>

Also in 1992, Threshold House released a "[[How to Destroy Angels (Remixes and Re-Recordings)|Remixes And Re-Recordings]]" version of ''How to Destroy Angels''. [[Nurse with Wound]]'s [[Steven Stapleton]] contributed a remix of the song, "How To Destroy Angels II".<ref>{{cite web|title=Coil – How To Destroy Angels (Remixes And Re-Recordings)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Coil-How-To-Destroy-Angels-Remixes-And-Re-Recordings/release/59384|website=Coil at Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=4 January 2015|date=2014}}</ref>

In 1993, Coil contributed music to [[Derek Jarman]]'s film ''[[Blue (1993 film)|Blue]]''. Their 1985 score for Jarman's ''[[The Angelic Conversation (film)|The Angelic Conversation]]'' was released on CD in 1994. In addition, they recorded soundtracks for the documentary ''[[Gay Man's Guide to Safer Sex]]'' as well as ''Sarah Dales Sensuous Massage''.<ref name="Compulsion, Number 1">{{cite news | url=http://brainwashed.com/coil/writings/compulsion.html | author = Dickie, Tony | title=Compulsion | work=Compulsion | date=Winter 1992 |access-date=20 April 2010}}</ref>

Much like the pre-Coil aliases, Coil's series of side projects represented a diverse basis from which the group evolved a different style of sound. While ''[[Nasa Arab]]''—credited to the group's project "The Eskaton"—was Coil's farewell to the acid house genre, the following projects, [[Born Again Pagans|ELpH]], [[A Thousand Lights in a Darkened Room|Black Light District]], and [[Time Machines]], were all based heavily on experimentation with [[Drone music|drone]], an ingredient that would define Coil's following work. These releases also launched the start of Coil's new label [[Eskaton]].

''Transparent'' was reissued in CD format in 1997 on Threshold House.{{Sfn|Gossling|2003|p=216}} A disc and booklet were packaged in a "thick" slipcase, which was released
in partnership with the World Serpent music company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zos Kia / Coil – Transparent|url=http://www.discogs.com/Zos-Kia-Coil-Transparent/release/90862|website=Zos Kia / Coil on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=4 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref>

===Late Coil (1998–2004)===
After the wave of experimental side projects, Coil's sound was completely redefined. Before releasing new material, the group released the compilations ''[[Unnatural History II]]'', ''[[Windowpane & The Snow]]'' and ''[[Unnatural History III]]''. In March 1998, Coil began to release a series of four singles which were timed to coincide with the [[equinox]] and [[solstice]]s of that year. The singles are characterized by slow, drone-like instrumental rhythms, and electronic or orchestral instrumentation.<ref name="Moons Milk (Brainwashed.com)">{{cite web

The second single, ''[[Summer Solstice: Bee Stings]]'', also featured performances by Breeze, and also included the [[industrial music|industrial]]-[[noise music|noise]] song "A Warning from the Sun (For Fritz)", which was dedicated to a friend of Balance and Christopherson's who had committed suicide earlier that year.<ref name="Coil News 1998">{{cite web

The single also features the song "Amethyst Deceivers", later reworked and performed throughout most of Coil's tour—it was eventually re-made into an alternate version on the LP ''[[The Ape of Naples]]''. The fourth single, ''[[Winter Solstice: North (album)|Winter Solstice: North]]'', also includes a track sung by McDowall, and is partially credited to the side project [[Rosa Mundi (group)|Rosa Mundi]]. The series would later be re-released as the double-CD set, ''[[Moon's Milk (In Four Phases)]]''.

''[[Astral Disaster]]'' was created with the assistance from new band member [[Thighpaulsandra]], and was released in January 1999 via [[Sun Dial]] member Gary Ramon's label, Prescription.<ref name="Astral Disaster (Brainwashed.com)">{{cite web

''[[Queens Of The Circulating Library]]'' followed in April 2000, with production credit given to Thighpaulsandra. The single-track, full-length drone album is the only Coil release made without the assistance of Christopherson. ''[[Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 2]]'' followed in September 2000, and Coil began to perform live more intensively, a period that also included writing the music for ''[[Black Antlers]]'' in between a series of mini-tours.<ref name="Black Antlers (Brainwashed.com)">{{cite web

Coil finally released ''Black Antlers'' in June 2004.

In contrast to many of their earlier releases, Coil's later material is characterized by a slower sound which relies more on drone than acid house. This change in sound was reflected in their live performances, as songs like "Ostia" and "Slur" were slowed down from their original pace, as well as re-recordings of "Teenage Lightning" and "Amethyst Deceivers" that were later released on ''The Ape Of Naples''.<ref name="The Ape Of Naples (Brainwashed.com)">{{cite web| url = http://www.brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/discog/thresh2.html

===Coil Live===
Coil's live incarnation is associated with a distinct legacy. The first live shows took place in 1983, but after only four performances, 15 years would pass before they would play live again.<ref name="Brainwashed Live Archive"/>

On 14 December 1999, Coil performed ''[[elph.zwölf]]'' at [[Volksbuehne]] in Berlin. Although the performance lasted just under 18 minutes, it marked the beginning of a new era of live performances. Coil would go on to perform close to 50 additional concerts, with varied [[set list]]s as well as performers.

Coil performed twice at the Royal Festival Hall in 2000. The first concert was in April, as part of a weekend curated by Julian Cope, when they first performed as the full band line-up&nbsp;– and wearing the "fluffy suits" that would become a staple of live performances for the first time&nbsp;– performing ''Time Machines''. They performed again in September, sharing a bill with Jim Thirlwell (as [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]]) on that occasion. Both performances were full sets.

Coil's performances were surrealistic visually and audibly. The signature fluffy suits, an idea inspired by [[Sun Ra]], played a foremost role at the live shows.<ref name="Rattlebag Radio RTE interview">{{cite interview|subject=Coil |interviewer=Dungan, Myles. |title=Rattlebag |publisher=[[RTÉ Radio 1]] |url=http://brainwashed.com/common/sounds/mp3/coil-interview-rattlebag_dublin-20041022.mp3 |location=Dublin, Ireland |date=22 October 2004 |access-date=26 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505090755/http://brainwashed.com/common/sounds/mp3/coil-interview-rattlebag_dublin-20041022.mp3 |archive-date=5 May 2006 }}</ref> The suits would later be used as album covers for the release ''[[Live One (Coil album)|Live One]]'', while other costumes appear on the covers of ''[[Live Two]]'' and ''[[Live Three]]''—straitjacket and mirror-chested hooded jumpsuit, respectively. Video screens projected footage and animations created by Christopherson, while fog machines created an eerie atmosphere. Balance would often screech and howl during performances, which would add to the effect.

The band's performance at the 2003 [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival was released as ''[[...And the Ambulance Died in His Arms]]''. Released on Threshold House in 2005 as a digipak, a Thai version was released the following year. ''...And the Ambulance Died in His Arms'' was released under a name chosen by Balance before his death in November 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coil – ...And The Ambulance Died In His Arms|url=http://www.discogs.com/Coil-And-The-Ambulance-Died-In-His-Arms/release/4948357|website=Coil on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=4 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Coil – ...And The Ambulance Died In His Arms|url=http://www.discogs.com/Coil-And-The-Ambulance-Died-In-His-Arms/release/444071|website=Coil on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=4 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref>

Many Coil performances were released, including the widely available releases of ''[[Live Four]]'', ''[[Live Three]]'', ''[[Live Two]]'', ''[[Live One (Coil album)|Live One]]'' and ''...And The Ambulance Died In His Arms'', as well as several very limited editions, such as ''[[Selvaggina, Go Back Into The Woods]]'' and ''[[Megalithomania!]]''. Video recordings of several concerts were released on the DVD box set, ''[[Colour Sound Oblivion]]'', in 2010.<ref name="Brainwashed 2006 News">{{cite web

===Deaths of Balance and Christopherson===
Balance died on 13 November 2004, after he fell from a second-floor landing in his home. Christopherson announced Balance's death on the Threshold House website, and provided details of the circumstances of the death. Balance's memorial service was held near Bristol on 23 November 2004, and was attended by approximately 100 people.<ref name="Departures">{{cite web|last=Christopherson |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Christopherson |title=Who'll Fall? |work=Threshold House |url-status=dead |year=2005 |access-date=2 March 2007 |url=http://www.thresholdhouse.com/departures.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226223256/http://www.thresholdhouse.com/departures.html |archive-date=26 February 2007 }}</ref>

The final studio album, ''The Ape of Naples'', was released on 2 December 2005. In August 2006, the rare CD-R releases ''[[The Remote Viewer]]'' and ''Black Antlers'' were "sympathetically remastered" and expanded into two-disc versions, which included new and recently remixed material. A comprehensive 16-DVD boxset, titled ''[[Colour Sound Oblivion]]'', was released in July 2010. A "Patron Edition" was pre-orderable in November 2009 and sold out in three hours. Christopherson also discussed the possibility of releasing Coil's entire back catalogue on a single [[Blu-ray]] disc.<ref name="Coil: The Million Dollar Altar">{{cite web

==Artistry==
===Style, instruments and creative methods===
Coil worked in such genres as industrial, noise, [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[dark ambient]], [[neo-folk]], [[spoken word]], drone, and [[Minimal music|minimalism]], treating their works more as magical rituals than as musical pieces;{{sfn|Keister|2016|p=154}} Balance explicitly referred to this approach as "magickal music".<ref name="Radio Inferno, Dutch Radio4 Supplement"/> Balance described early Coil work as "solar" and the later work as "moon musick".<ref name="Radio Inferno, Dutch Radio4 Supplement"/>{{sfn|Bey|Bailey|2012|p=112}}

Coil incorporated many exotic and rare instruments into their recordings and performances. The group expressed particular interest in [[modular synthesizer]]s, including the [[Moog synthesizer]].<ref name="The Complete Interview"/><ref name="Mutek">{{cite web

Other instruments the group incorporated into their music included the [[theremin]] and electronic [[shakuhachi]]. During Coil's later period, [[marimba]] player Tom Edwards joined the group, and performed on the live albums ''Live Two'' and ''Live Three'', as well as on the studio album, ''The Ape of Naples''.

===Limited editions===
Coil's distribution and marketing techniques sometimes included releasing a limited number of albums, thereby making them collectors' items among fans.<ref name="Coil News 2000">{{cite web| url = http://brainwashed.com/coil/news/news2000.html| title = Coil News 2000| publisher = Brainwashed.com | date=2000| access-date=23 December 2006}}</ref> Including things such as "art objects", blood stains and [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]]-like autographs in the packaging of their albums, Coil claimed that this made their work more personal for true fans, turning their records into something akin to [[occult]] artifacts.<ref name="Radio Inferno, Dutch Radio4 Supplement"/> This practice was markedly increased in the later half of Coil's career.

<blockquote>
We don't follow any particular religious dogma. In fact, quite the reverse, we tend to discourage the following of dogmas, or false prophets, as it were. And we don't have a very sympathetic view of Christians up to this point.

==Influences and legacy==
Although Coil expressed interest in many musical groups, they rarely, if ever, claimed to be influenced by them. Coil explicitly stated the influence of such non-musical sources as [[William Burroughs]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Brion Gysin]] and [[Austin Spare]].<ref name="Radio Inferno, Dutch Radio4 Supplement"/> Furthermore, the group were friends with Burroughs and owned some of Spare's original artwork.<ref name="Mutek"/>

Balance encouraged fans to trade, discuss and discover new and different forms of music, stressing the importance of variety. Music that Coil expressed interest in is diverse and wide-ranging, from [[musique concrète]] to [[folk music]] to [[hardcore punk]] to [[european classical music|classical]] to [[techno]]. Among the musicians Coil expressed interest in were early electronic, experimental and [[Minimal music|minimalist]] artists: [[Harry Partch]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] (once referred to by Balance as "an honorary member of Coil"), [[Alvin Lucier]], and [[Arvo Pärt]].<ref name="The Complete Interview">{{Cite news| last = Whitney | first = Jon | author-link = Jon Whitney (DJ) | title = The Complete Interview

<blockquote>
[Coil's] 'Tainted Love' video remains one of the greatest music videos of all time. I was always more attracted to Coil than Throbbing Gristle; the darkness and the scatology really chimed with me. If it's not immediately obvious: Horse Rotorvator was deeply influential on me. What they did to your senses. What they could do with sound. What Jhonn was doing lyrically. The exotic darkness of them permeated their work.<ref name="Harry">{{cite web|title=Trent Reznor On Coil & Nine Inch Nails, Plus Recoiled Review|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/14600-trent-reznor-interview-coil-nine-inch-nails|work=The Quietus|publisher=The Quietus|access-date=28 February 2014|author=Harry Sword|date=27 February 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

The track "At the Heart of It All" (found on ''Scatology'') later became the name of an [[Aphex Twin]] track on the Nine Inch Nails remix album ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]''; Coil also provided remixes for ''Further Down the Spiral'' as well as "Gave Up" on the remix album ''[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]''. Furthermore, in 2010, Reznor, [[Mariqueen Maandig]] and [[Atticus Ross]] started a new band called [[How to Destroy Angels (band)|How to Destroy Angels]]—named after the Coil song—which received Christopherson's blessing after Reznor made contact with him.<ref name="Harry" />{{sfn|Steirer|2015|p=192}}
