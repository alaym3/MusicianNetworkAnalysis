==History==
===Early days (2001–2003)===
A Day in the Life were formed by JT Woodruff, Jesse Blair, Andy Saunders, Josh Bethel, and Andy Lazier in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in 2001. They took their name from the popular [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[A Day in the Life]]".

Their first record was a demo titled ''Four Bullets for One Girl'', which sold its 500 copy run in 2 months.<ref name="showpreview">[http://www.athensmusician.net/archive/2003-04-23_dayinlife.php Show Preview: A Day In The Life, When Sparks Fly - by Maggie Brown - 4/23/2003<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201084348/http://www.athensmusician.net/archive/2003-04-23_dayinlife.php |date=December 1, 2007 }}</ref> This brought them to the attention of Confined Records, with which they released an album titled ''[[Nine Reasons to Say Goodbye]]''. Finally, they released a 6-song EP titled ''Paper Chromatography: The Fade from Dark to Light'' (which was later re-released as part of the compilation ''From Ohio With Love'')  in the winter of 2003.<ref name="showpreview"/>

In 2003, Matt Ridenour, bassist and vocal harmonies, would pass a Hotel called Hawthorn Inn & Suites on his way to work. He decided to add an e and Heights to make Hawthorne Heights. The rest of the band agreed.<ref>Hawthorne Heights Home School Session 2.</ref> 

===''The Silence in Black and White'' and ''If Only You Were Lonely'' (2004–2006)===
{{Main|The Silence in Black and White|If Only You Were Lonely}}
On the DVD portion of ''The Silence in Black and White'', drummer Eron Bucciarelli states that the band took their current name from the author [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. Vocalist and guitarist JT Woodruff is the only original member. The first song the band wrote after the change is titled "[[The Transition (song)|The Transition]]".

Their first album ''The Silence in Black and White'', was recorded over a four-week period, and was released in 2004. The album was slow to build sales at first; however, soon the video for the song "[[Ohio Is for Lovers]]" began getting airplay on MTV, and the band enjoyed breakout success at radio as well as a growing nationwide fan base, and the album became [[Victory Records]]' highest selling debut. ''The Silence in Black and White'' peaked at number 56 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts. The singles "Niki FM" and "Silver Bullet" were released in 2005.

When their second album ''If Only You Were Lonely'' was released on Feb 28, 2006, it debuted at number 3 on the Billboard charts, powered by the lead single "[[Saying Sorry]]" which has received regular airplay on MTV, [[VH1]] and Fuse. [[The Legion of Doom (mash up group)|The Legion of Doom]] remixed a song from the album, entitled "Where Can I Stab Myself in the Ears?" and it appeared on the ''[[Underworld: Evolution: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|Underworld: Evolution Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]''. The remix was re-titled "Where Do I Stab Myself in the Ears".

The band performed on the 2006 [[Nintendo Fusion Tour]]. A live CD/DVD was intended to be recorded from this tour, but was cancelled, likely due to complications with Victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/hawthorne_heights_to_record_for_live_cddvd.html |title=Hawthorne Heights To Record For Live CD/DVD &#124; News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date=September 29, 2006 |access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>

===Death of Casey Calvert (2007)===
Casey Calvert, the band's rhythm guitarist, was found dead on the band's tour bus on November 24, 2007. The band had begun its American tour just the day before in [[Detroit, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawthorneheights.com |title=Hawthorne Heights website |publisher=Hawthorneheights.com |date=September 26, 2012 |access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=279944 "I'm Sorry I Have to Be the One to Post This."] Absolutepunk.net. November 24, 2007.</ref> Toxicology and autopsy reports stated that Calvert died of [[combined drug intoxication]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1576570/20071217/hawthorne_heights.jhtml |title=Hawthorne Heights' Calvert Died of Medication Mixture|website=Mtv.com |date=December 17, 2007 |access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref> A statement issued by the members of the band said that Calvert died in his sleep, and that his body was discovered before the band was to carry out a sound check before its show at the 9:30 Club in [[Washington, D.C.]] The members of the band spent a few days mourning, reflecting, and writing a song about the death.

This song became "Four Become One" on its album ''[[Fragile Future]]''. The members also dedicated another song to Calvert called "Sugar in the Engine". In the end of the song, JT Woodruff can be heard speaking of Calvert. Calvert was 26 years old when he died. When the band plays old hits from either ''[[The Silence in Black and White]]'' or ''[[If Only You Were Lonely]]'', Carli stepped in and did all of Calvert's parts, until he left the band in 2015 Mark McMillon is now the current unclean vocalist for the band.

According to the results of an autopsy performed by the office of the chief medical examiner in Washington, and released in December 2007, Calvert's death was accidental. Dr. John Mendelson, a pharmacologist at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, told [[MTV News]] that "Cases like Calvert's are so rare that they're almost nonexistent. It's so rare that you can't even put a number on it,"<ref name=caseydrugresult>{{cite news

Drummer Eron Bucciarelli issued the following statement:

<blockquote>From the time of the incident we suspected a possible drug interaction as the cause. Casey wrestled with depression for as long as we knew him. He saw numerous doctors and took an ever-changing array of medicines to get better. He finally had his depression under control. According to the toxicology report, the cause of death was due to a fatal interaction between depression meds, anxiety meds, and an opiate. Opiates being mentioned along with the term "substance abuse", coupled with "rockstar" stereotypes immediately conjure up images of hard drug use and addiction, which simply couldn't be further from the truth in Casey's instance. What the toxicology report doesn't show is that before our leaving for tour, Casey had a root canal, and he was prescribed Vicodin (an opiate) for the pain. Once again, Casey was not involved in anything illegal, nor was he a substance abuser.<ref>{{cite news

{{Main|Fragile Future}}
Hawthorne Heights released a demo for their new song "Come Back Home" on their MySpace page in 2007. A reprised version of the song became one of the twelve tracks that were selected for the band's third studio album. A second song was released on their Myspace, a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Smashing Pumpkins]] song "[[Bullet with Butterfly Wings]]", which was contributed to MySpace Tribute to The Smashing Pumpkins.

{{Main|Skeletons (Hawthorne Heights album)|Midwesterners: The Hits}}
Hawthorne Heights posted a blog through their MySpace profile stating that they had officially been signed to [[Wind-up Records]], and had been writing and recording for a new record. The band revealed that while there is not a new member of the band and no replacement was made for Hawthorne Heights former vocalist, Casey Calvert, the new album would feature a new "screamer".<ref>[https://archive.today/20120728194916/http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1031552] </ref> While on tour, Hawthorne Heights announced that Micah Carli would now be providing screaming vocals for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenjunderground.com/blog/2009/11/16/hawthorne-heights-school-of-rock-111309.html |title=Hawthorne Heights @ School of Rock 11.13.09 - News - Fake Walls |website=Thenjunderground.com |date=2009-11-16 |access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>

As the album was being recorded, lead singer JT Woodruff and drummer Eron Bucciarelli named two songs from the record on several occasions, leading many to believe that they would be released as singles. Acoustic versions of the two songs were also said to have been recorded. The songs are entitled "Here I Am" and "Nervous Breakdown".  "[[Nervous Breakdown (Hawthorne Heights song)|Nervous Breakdown]]" did become the first single from the album on March 23, 2010. On October 2, 2009, both Woodruff and Buicarelli posted updates on their Twitter pages saying that they had just finished gang vocals for the record. Woodruff stated "Just finished up doing gang vocals on a few songs. Return to hardcore!"<ref>{{cite web|author=JTHawthorne |url=https://twitter.com/JTHawthorne |title=JT Woodruff (JTHawthorne) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=February 26, 2010}}</ref>

On October 14, an e-mail was sent out to the official mailing list telling fans that the new album would be titled ''[[Skeletons (Hawthorne Heights album)|Skeletons]]'' and would be released in early 2010. The e-mail stated:

Eron Bucciarelli, the band's drummer, noted that the band's sound has "always been pigeon holed as emo or screamo".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drivenfaroff.com/2007/07/28/hawthorne-heights-interview-july-25th-2007/ |title=Hawthorne Heights Interview – July 25, 2007 |publisher=Driven Far Off |access-date=February 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930032058/http://www.drivenfaroff.com/2007/07/28/hawthorne-heights-interview-july-25th-2007/ |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the same interview he said that the band prefers to be referred to simply as "a rock band".

While commenting on the band's first album, ''[[The Silence in Black and White]]'', Eron said that the "triple guitar attack" allows them to "add a lot of layering effects and intricacies to our music along with legitimately pulling in different musical styles."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=2704 |title=Hawthorne Heights - The Silence in Black And White (album review) |website=Sputnikmusic |date=June 25, 2005 |access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref> The album also includes feminine backing vocals provided by band member Micah Carli's sister, Graci Carli.

===Incident with Ne-Yo===

{{quote|As for Ne-Yo, the name of the game is to decrease the chances of a sale here. If you were to pick up handful of Ne-Yo CDs, as if you were about to buy them, but then changed your mind and didn't bother to put them back in the same place, that would work. Even though this record will be heavily stocked and you might not be able to move all the stock, just relocating a handful creates issues: Even though the store will appear to be out of stock, the computer will see it as in stock and not re-order the title once it sells down and then Ne-Yo will lose a few sales later in the week.<ref>

On March 5, 2007 a federal judge in Chicago ruled that Victory Records does ''not'' hold exclusive rights for the band's recording services and that the band can record for any label. Specifically, the Judge stated: "The agreement contains no exclusivity provision, nor does any of its language appear to prevent [the band] from recording elsewhere during the life of the agreement".<ref>{{cite news

The judge later reaffirmed this ruling on May 17, 2007, stating that Hawthorne Heights is still contractually bound to deliver two albums to Victory, but may record albums which are released elsewhere.<ref>{{cite news
