'''Waxahatchee''' is an American [[independent music|indie]] music project, formed in 2010 by American singer-songwriter '''Katie Crutchfield''' (born January 4, 1989), previously a member of [[P.S. Eliot]]. The band is named after [[Waxahatchee Creek]], in [[Alabama]], where Crutchfield grew up.<ref name="pitchrising">{{cite web |url= http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9045-waxahatchee/ |title=Rising: Waxahatchee |first=Jenn |last=Pelly |work=Pitchfork.com |access-date=29 December 2013}}</ref> Originally an acoustic solo project, her recordings now tend to involve a backing band, and the music has increasingly been performed this way. Crutchfield, as Waxahatchee, has released 5 albums to date: ''[[American Weekend]]'' (2012), ''[[Cerulean Salt]]'' (2013), ''[[Ivy Tripp]]'' (2015), ''[[Out in the Storm]]'' (2017) and ''[[Saint Cloud (album)|Saint Cloud]]'' (2020).
