'''Enanitos Verdes''' (literal translation: "Little green dwarves", roughly equivalent to the English phrase "[[Little green men]]") is a [[rock music|rock]] [[Trio (music)|trio]] from [[Argentina]], formed in 1979 in the city of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]].

==History==
The band started in 1979, with [[Marciano Cantero]] ([[bass guitar]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s and [[vocals]]), [[Felipe Staiti]] ([[guitar]]) and [[Daniel Piccolo]] [[drums]]. That same year, they performed throughout the [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo region]]. Later they traveled to [[Buenos Aires]] to record a demo, with unusable results that were never released. In spite of this failure, they continued doing shows in [[Mendoza province|Mendoza]] and in Buenos Aires.

In 1984 the band added two new members: [[Sergio Embrioni]] (guitar and vocals) and [[Tito Dávila]] (keyboard). As a quintet they published the disc ''Los Enanitos Verdes'', with the hit "Aún sigo cantando" ("I'm still singing"). Embrioni left the band in 1985.

In 1986 they published their second album, entitled ''Contrarreloj'' (''Counterclockwise''), with the artistic production of [[Andrés Calamaro]]. The album included songs such as "Tus viejas cartas" ("Your old letters"), "Cada vez que digo adiós" ("Every time I say goodbye"), and "La muralla verde" ("The green wall"). Their third album ''Habitaciones extrañas'' (''Strange Rooms'') would arrive the following year. Produced again by Calamaro, it included "Te vi en un tren" ("I saw you in a train"), "Por el resto" ("For the rest") and "El extraño de pelo largo" ("The stranger with the long hair").

In 1988 they did an extensive tour, following in the footsteps of [[Miguel Mateos]]/Zas and [[Soda Stereo]]. During six months three particular concerts stood out: [[Viña del Mar]] (50,000 spectators), [[Mendoza, Argentina]] (35,000) and [[Santiago, Chile]] (32,000). In that same year they published their new LP, ''Carrousel''. The song "Guitarras blancas" (white guitars) became one of the main hits of the album. A year later the group broke up, with [[Marciano Cantero]] starting his solo career. In 1992, the group got back together, recording the album ''Igual que ayer'' (''Same as Yesterday'').

After recording four more albums, in 1998 they released their album ''Tracción acústica'', with the US record company [[PolyGram|Polygram]]. This album made them the first Argentine group and third Argentine artist to sign with a US company. This album was nominated for the [[Grammy|Grammies]] in the category "Best Latin Rock Album".

They were part of the Watcha Tour 2000, which included seventeen shows along with [[Molotov (band)|Molotov]], [[Aterciopelados]], [[Café Tacuba]] and A.N.I.M.A.L.

In 2003, they went on tour with [[Alejandra Guzmán]]. They have, among other things, earned a ''Gaviota de Plata'' (''Silver Gull'') at the ''[[Festival de Viña del Mar]]'' in [[Chile]]. That same year they recorded their album ''Amores Lejanos'' with the hit single "Amores Lejanos"
In 2009 original member Daniel Piccolo (drummer) left the band. Jota Morelli from Fito Paez's band replaced him.
