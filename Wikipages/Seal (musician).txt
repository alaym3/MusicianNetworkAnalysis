==Music career==
<!-- This section is linked from [[Francisca Urio]] -->

===Early career===
In the 1980s, Seal spent a short time singing in local clubs and bars. In 1987, he joined Push, a British funk band, and toured with them in Japan. In [[Thailand]], he joined a [[blues]] band for a while before separating from the group and journeying throughout [[India]] on his own. He returned to England, sleeping on the couch of friend Julian Bunster, then a model. He sometimes asked him, "do I sing well?", to which he often received the response that he sang better than most current artists. He then met producer [[Adamski]] and performed the lyrics on Adamski's single "[[Killer (Adamski song)|Killer]]".<ref name="vh1.com VH1 biography"/>

===''Seal'' (1991)===
{{Main article|Seal (1991 album)}}
"Killer" eventually reached number one in the UK.<ref name="UKChart"/> Seal subsequently signed to [[ZTT Records]] and released his [[Seal (1991 album)|self-titled début album]] (produced by [[Trevor Horn]]) in 1991. Two versions of the album are known to be in circulation: the original "premix" version and a second, more common version with an updated mix. This is attributed to the demand for a produced single rushing the final album edit, and as Seal puts it, producer Horn's "inability to let go".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futureloveparadise.co.uk/index.html?s=anthology&d=disc-album&p=seal1edit |title=10 Years on and Still the Web's Best Source of Seal Info |publisher=Future Love Paradise |access-date=26 April 2011}}</ref>

''Seal'' was positively received by critics. The singles "[[Crazy (Seal song)|Crazy]]", "Future Love Paradise", and his own rendition of "Killer" performed well on the charts. In particular, "Crazy" became an international hit in 1991, reaching number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the US.<ref name="UKChart"/><ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=seal|chart=all}} |title=Seal: Single Chart History |work=Billboard |access-date=26 April 2011}}</ref> Seal stole the show at the [[List of BRIT Awards ceremonies#1992|1992]] [[Brit Awards]] held at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]], London, with the first hat-trick of wins in the history of the event.<ref name="Brits">{{cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1992 |title=History |publisher=Brit Awards |date=16 October 2015 |access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref> He won in three categories: Best British Male, Best British Video ("Killer"), and Best British Album (''Seal'').<ref name="Brits"/>

In 1992, Seal appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD ''[[Red Hot + Dance]]'', contributing an exclusive track "Crazy (If I Was Trev Mix)". The album, featuring [[George Michael]] and [[Madonna]] among others, raised money and awareness in support of the AIDS epidemic by donating all proceeds to AIDS charities.

===''Seal II'' (1994)===
{{Main article|Seal (1994 album)}}
After Seal regrouped with Trevor Horn, his second album, also [[Seal (1994 album)|self-titled]], was released in 1994. A success, the album featured the singles "Prayer for the Dying" and "Newborn Friend", and later received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. "Prayer for the Dying" became a minor pop hit in the US, peaking at number 21 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. A third single, "[[Kiss from a Rose]]", performed modestly when released, but was later featured to much wider popularity when it was remixed for the soundtrack to ''[[Batman Forever]]''. "Kiss from a Rose" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] in 1996, becoming Seal's best-performing single on the US market (it topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in late August 1995) and hit number four in the UK.<ref name="UKChart">Roberts, David (2006). [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]. London: Guinness World Records Limited</ref><ref name="Billboard"/>

===''Human Being''===
{{Main article|Human Being (album)}}
In 1998, Seal released ''Human Being''. The album was the product of a turbulent time in his life, including a split and later reconciliation with producer Horn, as well as Seal's parting with ZTT Records and his signing with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1997. The record was panned upon its release. It received gold record certification by the [[RIAA]] just two months after its release date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/ |title=Home |publisher=RIAA |date=3 November 2015 |access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref> The album provided three singles, "Human Beings", "Latest Craze", and "Lost My Faith".

===''Togetherland''===
{{Main article|Togetherland}}
In 2001, fans awaited the arrival of a new album, announced as ''Togetherland''. After a protracted postproduction period, the album was cancelled. The official word was that Seal simply did not think it made the grade, although this conflicts with other reports,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/co2/redwolf707/seal.html |title=Clay's Seal Page |website=Angelfire.com |access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref> that said the album was turned down by the label because producers felt the album would not be commercially successful. Even so, one single was released from the album; "This Could Be Heaven" was released in the US and featured on ''[[The Family Man]]'' soundtrack. Since December 2006, Seal has indicated that he has plans to excerpt cuts from ''Togetherland'' and make them available for streaming download. Meanwhile, Seal co-wrote and provided vocals for the hit single "[[My Vision (song)|My Vision]]" from [[Jakatta]] in 2002. He also recorded a successful duet with French singer [[Mylène Farmer]] called "[[Les Mots (song)|''Les Mots'']]" during that same period. Also in 2002, Seal lent his vocals to the song "You Are My Kind", the fourth track on [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]'s album ''[[Shaman (album)|Shaman]]''.

===''Seal IV''===
{{Main article|Seal (2003 album)}}
In 2003, Seal released his fourth album ''Seal IV''. Although it never achieved the sales figures of either of his first two albums, this release brought him back into the public eye in the United States and continental Europe. Singles from the album include "Waiting for You", "Get It Together", and "[[Love's Divine]]" – this single was released in 2004 and was a big hit in several European countries.

===Greatest hits album: ''Best 1991–2004''===
{{Main article|Best 1991–2004}}
In 2004, a greatest-hits album entitled ''Seal: Best 1991–2004'' was released, including a cover of the [[Burt Bacharach|Bacharach]]/[[Hal David|David]] classic "Walk On By" and a cover of [[Echo & the Bunnymen]]'s song "Lips Like Sugar". An edition of the album was available that included an extra CD with acoustic versions of some of Seal's hits.

===''Live in Paris''===
Also in 2004, Seal performed shows at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia Theatre]] in Paris. The show of 6 July 2004 was recorded and released about one year after as a CD/DVD package, simply titled ''Live in Paris''.

===''One Night to Remember''===
In June 2005, Seal recorded a concert which was subsequently released in 2006, entitled ''One Night to Remember'', as a CD/DVD combination. The DVD includes a "making of" documentary in addition to the live performance. Recorded in a historic steel mill, the ''Altes Kesselhaus'' ("old boiler house"), in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany, this performance includes a version of Brahms' ''Lullaby'' which Seal sings in German and then in English. Unlike earlier recordings in which Seal is accompanied by his band, a full orchestra and choir of 52 musicians accompanies the singer.

===''System''===
{{Main article|System (album)}}

On the track titled "Wedding Day", Seal sings a duet with his then wife, model [[Heidi Klum]].

About these renewals, Seal said in 2010, "Each year, Heidi and I get remarried. It's a great party, but for about an hour, we go off on our own down to a private beach.

On 11 June 2009, Seal, on tour with his new album ''Soul'', revealed, "It is nice to be in newspapers and magazines for something other than my marriage".

==Controversy==
In October 2011, Seal came under criticism from human-rights groups for appearing at an event in [[Grozny]], [[Chechnya]], that turned into a birthday celebration for [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], the President of Chechnya.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/466042/seal-takes-heat-for-serenading-chechen-strongman |title=Seal takes heat for serenading Chechen strongman |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=13 October 2011 }}</ref> Also appearing at the event were the actress [[Hilary Swank]], actor [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], and violinist [[Vanessa-Mae]]. The New York-based [[Human Rights Foundation]] claims that it sent letters to invitees in advance of the event noting Kadyrov's record and asking them to decline the invitations.<ref name="humanrightsfoundation1">{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsfoundation.org/media/HilarySwankapologizes20111012.html |title=Hilary Swank apologizes – Pleads ignorance; but will she keep the Chechen warlord's money? |publisher=[[Human Rights Foundation]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017115719/http://www.humanrightsfoundation.org/media/HilarySwankapologizes20111012.html |archive-date=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Human Rights Watch sent an inquiry to Seal regarding his performance at the event and released a statement about the incident that said:
<blockquote>Ramzan Kadyrov is linked to a litany of horrific human rights abuses. It's inappropriate for stars to get paid to party with him. It bolsters his image and legitimizes a brutal leader and his regime. And getting paid to be part of such a lavish show in Chechnya trivialises the suffering of countless victims of human rights abuses there.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seal-chechnya-human-rights-247508 |title=Seal's Chechen Leader Birthday Bash Performance Questioned By Human Rights Group |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Kim |last=Masters |date=12 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/13/hilary-swank-regrets-chechen-party |title=Hilary Swank 'regrets' partying with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Miriam |last=Elder |date=13 October 2011 }}</ref></blockquote>

Seal refused to apologise for appearing at the event, sending a message from his Twitter account telling people to "leave me out of your politics".<ref name="humanrightsfoundation1"/> Seal was reported to have made $500,000 for singing at the party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/10/24/celebrities-chummy-with-dictators-risk-damaging-their-brand/ |title=Hilary Swank cancels Toronto speech amid controversy over Ramzan Kadyrov birthday appearance |first=Tom |last=Blackwell |work=[[National Post]] |date=24 October 2011 |access-date=31 October 2011 }}</ref>
