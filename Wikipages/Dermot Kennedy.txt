==Career==
Dermot Kennedy officially began his career [[Street performance|busking]] at 17 years old; however, his career did not become viable until his mid-twenties, having spent over a decade in the industry.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Clayton-Lea|first=Tony|date=13 July 2020|title=Dermot Kennedy: 'I won't let anyone take advantage of me or my music'|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/dermot-kennedy-i-won-t-let-anyone-take-advantage-of-me-or-my-music-1.4301630|website=The Irish Times|language=en}}</ref> Through busking, he was able to develop his sound, travelling to multiple major cities such as [[Dublin]], in his home country Ireland, and [[Boston]] in the United States to perform.<ref name="riff"/> Kennedy was also invited to open for [[Glen Hansard]], whom he had previously met while busking in Dublin and stayed in touch with via text message.<ref name="riff"/>

Outside of his solo career, Kennedy began a band named "Shadows and Dust" with three other members during his studies, including Michael Quinn who is the current drummer for Dermot. Although he enjoyed the experience, the band later split up in 2015.<ref name="riff" />

In 2018 and 2019, he toured the United States, Australia and Europe to sold-out audiences. His first festivals were [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in 2017; [[Lollapalooza]],<ref name="grammy">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/dermot-kennedy-how-producer-mike-dean-changed-his-outlook|title=Dermot Kennedy On Mike Dean Collaboration|date=11 September 2018|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en|access-date=18 January 2019}}</ref> [[South by Southwest|South by Southwest Festival]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2018/08/23/641211708/dermot-kennedy-on-world-cafe|title=Dermot Kennedy On World Cafe|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=18 January 2019}}</ref> and [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Austin City Limits Radio|title=93 Seconds with Dermot Kennedy [Interview] {{!}} Austin City Limits Radio|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3dz5szCqF8|access-date=18 January 2019}}</ref> in 2018.

== Philanthropy ==
In early 2020, in collaboration with other artists, Kennedy contributed his vocals to [[Songs for Australia|Songs For Australia]], covering [[Matt Corby]]'s "Resolution".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Zemler|first=Emily|date=17 February 2020|title=The National, Kurt Vile Contribute Covers to 'Songs For Australia' Benefit Album|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-national-kurt-vile-songs-for-australia-benefit-album-953831/|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> The album, organized by [[Julia Stone]], was created to raise proceeds in aid of organizations helping Australia recover from their bushfire crisis.

Amidst the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Kennedy participated in ''Billboard''{{'}}s Live At-Home concert.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dermot Kennedy Covers Kid Cudi's 'Pursuit of Happiness' During Billboard Live At-Home Concert: Watch|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9346442/dermot-kennedy-live-at-home-performance|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref> He helped them raise money for the non-profit [[Housing Works]], by organizing a short virtual concert. Following that event, Kennedy organized his own virtual concert, Sound Waves, in May 2020 in support of [[World Health Organization|WHO]]'s [[COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund|Solidarity Response Fund]].<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web | title=Here Are All the Livestreams & Virtual Concerts to Watch During the Coronavirus Crisis: Week of May 18 | website=Billboard | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9379590/livestream-concerts-to-watch-week-of-may-18 | access-date=9 December 2020}}</ref>

==Style and influences==
In his music, Kennedy has tried to bridge his two genres, [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Hip hop|hip-hop]], together.<ref name="riff" /> This is a change from his past works, which were more acoustic. Unlike some songwriters, he does not write with specific moments or events in mind. He writes them naturally when listening to the track, as specific memories and emotions are triggered through the music.<ref>{{Cite web|date=26 February 2020|title=Interview - Dermot Kennedy|url=https://www.montrealrocks.ca/interview-dermot-kennedy/|website=Montreal Rocks|language=en-US}}</ref>

''[[GQ]]'' magazine described Kennedy as a "singer with a rich, reverbant voice, [with] epically emotive songwriting skills (think [[Ed Sheeran]], but darker, more melancholy)."<ref name="gq" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'', of his 2018 [[South by Southwest]] Festival performance, said he has "a grainy, melancholy voice that can crest with a howling rasp..."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/arts/music/sxsw-south-by-southwest-festival-best-music.html|title=South by Southwest Music Festival: 17 Acts That Stood Out|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=18 March 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=18 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

He cites [[Ray LaMontagne]], [[David Gray (musician)|David Gray]], [[Damien Rice]] and [[Glen Hansard]] as inspirations for his folk style. His recent work has included hip-hop influences, reflected notably in his collaborative work with [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] on the EP ''Mike Dean Presents: Dermot Kennedy'', which Kennedy has also described as a "[[Mixtape|mix tape]]".<ref name="grammy" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.joe.co.uk/entertainment/you-should-know-dermot-kennedy-171116|title=You Should Know...
