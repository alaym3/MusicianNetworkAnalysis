==History==
Beast Coast was formed in 2012, but the relationships within the group members date back to the time growing up together in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] and [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford–Stuyvesant]]. [[Pro Era]] formed their collective while attending Edward R. Murrow High School. [[The Underachievers]] and [[Zombie Juice]] became acquainted through a childhood friend of [[AK the Savior]]. The co-founder of Pro Era, [[Capital Steez|Capital STEEZ]], died by suicide in December 2012, followed by the death of ASAP Yams in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rinder |first1=Grant |title=The Brotherhood of Beast Coast |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/05/beast-coast-escape-from-new-york-profile-interview |website=Complex |accessdate=23 May 2019}}</ref>
