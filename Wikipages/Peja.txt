'''Peja''' ({{lang-sq-definite|Pejë}} {{IPA-sq|pɛˈjə|pron}}) or '''Peć''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Пећ}} {{IPA-sr|petɕ|pron}}) is the fourth largest [[List of cities and towns in Kosovo|city]] of [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} and seat of Peja Municipality and [[District of Peja|Peja District]]. It is situated in the region of [[Rugova (region)|Rugova]] on the eastern section of the [[Accursed Mountains]] along [[Peja's Lumbardh]] in the western part of Kosovo.

In medieval times the city, then commonly known under its Serbian name, was the seat of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1346. The [[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Patriarchal monastery of Peć]] is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] as part of the [[Medieval Monuments in Kosovo]].<br/>
Under Ottoman rule the city, then commonly known under the Turkish name ''İpek'', became a district capital with mosques and civil architecture.<br/>
From the end of the nineteenth century until today, the city has been the site of nationalist aspirations and claims for both [[Albanians in Kosovo|ethnic Albanians]] and [[Serbs in Kosovo|Serbs]], often resulting in tense inter-ethnic relations and conflict.

According to the 2011 census, the city of Peja has 48,962 inhabitants, while the municipality has 96,450 inhabitants. The municipality covers an area of {{convert|602|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, including the city of Peja and 95 villages; it is divided into 28 territorial communities.

== Etymology ==

In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], ''peć'' means "furnace" or "cave", and its name is probably connected with nearby caves in the [[Rugova Canyon]] which served as hermit cells for Serbian Orthodox monks.<ref>[http://ia311343.us.archive.org/GnuBook/GnuBookImages.php?zip=/1/items/lacivilisationse00jireuoft/lacivilisationse00jireuoft_jp2.zip&file=lacivilisationse00jireuoft_jp2/lacivilisationse00jireuoft_0029.jp2&scale=4] {{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> In medieval [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] documents, the Serbian name of the city (Peć, lit. "furnace") is sometimes translated as ''Forno'', meaning "furnace" in [[Italian language|Italian]]. During Ottoman rule, it was known as [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''İpek'' (ايپك). The [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name's definite form is ''Peja'' and the indefinite ''Pejë''. Other names of the city include [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Pescium'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Episkion'' (Επισκιον). The city was first mentioned as Siparantum, by [[Ptolemy]] in his work ''Gheographia''. <ref> |date=August 2021}}  https://historikuipejes.weebly.com/historiku-i-pejes.html</ref>

== History ==

=== Early development ===

[[File:Patrikana_e_Pejës.jpg|thumb|left|The Patriarchal Monastery of Peć was the seat of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] from the 14th century, when its status was upgraded into a patriarchate.]]

The city is located in a strategic position on [[Peja's Lumbardh]], a tributary of the [[White Drin]] to the east of the [[Accursed Mountains]]. The medieval city was possibly built on the ruins of ''Siparant(um)'', a Roman ''[[municipium]]'' (town or city).<ref name="PakVrišer1980">{{citation|author1=Mirko Pak|author2=Igor Vrišer|title=Urban and industrial geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WoLAQAAIAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Inštitut za geografija univerze Edvarda Kardelja v Ljubljani|quote=Prema tome, od gore spomenutih cinjenica mozemo pretpostaviti da je stara Pec bila municipij i da se u dardansko-rimsko doba nazivala Siparant, odnosno Slparantum.}}</ref> The area has the most unearthed [[stelae]] in all of Kosovo.<ref name="PakVrišer1980"/>

Slavs ([[Sclaveni]] and [[Antes (people)|Antes]]) settled the Balkans, heavily depopulated by "[[Barbarians in the Byzantine Empire|Barbarians]]", in the 6th century. The [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] fought for control of the area until it finally fell under full Serbian control. Between 1180 and 1190, Serbian Grand Prince [[Stefan Nemanja]] liberated Peja with its surrounding ''[[župa]]'' (district) of [[Hvosno]] from the Byzantine Empire, thus establishing Serbian rule over the city of Peja for next 300 years.<ref>{{citation|author1=John V. A. Fine|author2=John Van Antwerp Fine|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDFVUDmAIqIC|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08260-5|page=7}}</ref> In 1220, Serbian King [[Stefan Nemanjić]] donated Peja and several surrounding villages to his newly founded monastery of [[Žiča]].<ref>[http://ia331403.us.archive.org/GnuBook/GnuBookImages.php?zip=/0/items/monumentaserbica00mikluoft/monumentaserbica00mikluoft_jp2.zip&file=monumentaserbica00mikluoft_jp2/monumentaserbica00mikluoft_0029.jp2&scale=4] {{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> As Žiča was the seat of a Serbian archbishop, Peja came under direct rule of Serbian archbishops and later patriarchs who built their residences and numerous churches in the city starting with the church of Holy Apostles built by archbishop [[Saint Arsenije I Sremac]]. After the Žiča monastery was burned by the [[Cumans]] (between 1276 and 1292) the seat of Serbian archbishop was transferred to a more secure location - [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć]] where it remained until the abolition of the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] in 1766.

The city became a major religious center of [[History of Medieval Serbia|medieval Serbia]] under the Serbian Emperor [[Stefan Dušan]], who made it the seat of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1346. It retained this status until 1766, when the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć was abolished. Today, Peja holds the memory of old Serbian Patriarchate. The city and its surrounding area are still revered by adherents of Serbian Orthodoxy; the city is the site of the [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć]], which is an easy walk from the city center and consists of four fresco-decorated churches, a library, and a treasury. The 14th century [[Visoki Dečani monastery]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], lies about {{convert|19|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south, in nearby [[Dečani|Deçan]].

In 1835 the Albanian population supported by other Albanian rebels from Shkodra took over the town from the Ottomans.<ref name=Pollo1984p124> {{harvnb|Pollo|1984|p.124}}</ref>

The Albanian nationalist organization [[League of Peja]] established in 1899 was based in the city. The organization, led by [[Haxhi Zeka]], adopted the character of the earlier [[League of Prizren]] to defend the rights of Ottoman Albanians and seek autonomous status within the empire. After an armed clash with Ottoman forces in 1900 the organization ended its operations.<ref>Bep Jubani et al., ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: për shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Pristina, 2002) 182-185.</ref>{{better source needed|date=December 2020}}

=== Modern period ===

Ottoman rule came to an end in the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912–13, when [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] took control of the city on 28 October 1912. On 8 January 1916, during [[World War I]], [[Austria-Hungary]] took the city. Peja was taken by Serbian forces on 17 October 1918. After World War I, the city became part of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (at first officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes). Between 1931 and 1941 the city was part of [[Zeta Banovina]]. During [[World War II]] Peja was occupied by the Italian puppet state of [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Albania]]. After the war, Peja again became part of [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] as part of the [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945–1963)]], an autonomous unit within the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]].

Relations between [[Serbs in Kosovo|Serbs]] and [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians]], who were the majority population, were often tense during the 20th century. They came to a head in the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999, during which the city suffered heavy damage and mass killings.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mcgeary |first=Johanna |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991342-1,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203000824/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991342-1,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 3, 2008 |title=Crimes Of War |publisher=TIME |date=1999-06-28 |access-date=2016-01-13}}</ref> More than 80 percent of the total 5280 houses in the city were heavily damaged (1590) or destroyed (2774).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/kosovo/undword-03.htm |title=UNDER ORDERS: War Crimes in Kosovo – 4.

=== Architecture ===

The architecture in Peja show different architectural styles, from the [[medieval Serbian architecture|medieval Serbian]], [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]], Yugoslav, and contemporary architecture. Because of this there are many churches, mosques, buildings which are attraction points in the city and were built by the aforementioned influences.

Notable architectural traits of Peja include:
*[[Bazaar of Peja]], Ottoman-era market in the center of the city. It was destroyed during World War II and the Kosovo War. It has been fully rebuilt.
*[[Bajrakli Mosque, Peja|Bajrakli Mosque]], Ottoman-built mosque in the Bazaar of Peja. It was destroyed during World War II and then rebuilt.
*[[Hamam of Peja]], Ottoman-era bath

=== Cinema ===

Peja has one local cinema, [[Kinema Jusuf Gërvalla]], which also functions as a cultural center. It was built in 1955 with money of the Workers’ Union. Back then, the cinema was called 'Kino Rad' ('Workers' Cinema'). Its goals was to provide a cultural space in the city of Peja. During the period 1955-1998 it served as a central point of joint cultural activities for the residents of Peja. Activities included screenings of the latest films, public discussions, music concerts, theatrical performances and children’s programs. The cinema was closed down when the war started in 1998 and was heavily damaged in the years after, just like the rest of Peja. In 2000, the building was renovated and partly reconstructed. In 2001, the cinema was reopened, with its name changed to ‘Kinema Jusuf Gërvalla’ in 2002. However, activities became more sporadic, due to technical difficulties and lack of public interest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anibar.org/cinema/bioskopi/|title = Bioskopi}}</ref>

In 2016, by a municipal decision, the cinema with all its assets was given to the non-governmental organization [[Anibar International Animation Festival|Anibar]], which since 2010 organized the Anibar International Animation Festival in the cinema. The goal was to revitalize Kinema Jusuf Gërvalla. But later that year the Privatization Agency of Kosovo put the building on the list of buildings for privatization, which meant it would lose its public function. However, backlash emerged against the idea of taking this important historic and cultural site from the local community. The protests secured Kinema Jusuf Gërvalla a spot on the temporary list of protected cultural heritage buildings in Kosovo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anibar.org/cinema/bioskopi/|title = Bioskopi}}</ref> Currently, Kinema Jusuf Gërvalla is functioning as a cultural center which hosts movie screenings, musical performances, poetry nights, board game nights, and more. It also offers guided tours, which introduces you to the rich history of the cinema.
