==History==
===2015–2018: Formation, singles and the ''This Is as One'' EP ===
The band initially formed in 2015, fronted by vocalist Zac Vernon who appears on their first recorded and released tracks, including "Immerse" and "Luna". However, he soon parted ways with the band and formed Parting Gift<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/interview-holding-absence-07052017/|title=INTERVIEW: Holding Absence (07/05/2017)|website=Dead Press!|date=7 May 2017}}</ref> leaving the door open to Lucas Woodland of defunct outfit, Falling With Style.

Upon Lucas joining the band in 2016, Holding Absence released "Permanent", their debut single under this iteration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/video-holding-absence-permanent/|title=VIDEO: Holding Absence – Permanent|website=Dead Press!|date=19 August 2016}}</ref> The band would soon go on to follow up the release of "Permanent" with their contrasting single "Dream of Me", gaining the attention of US-based record label "[[SharpTone Records|Sharptone Records]]".<ref name="auto"/>

In 2017, the band signed with [[SharpTone Records]], with a physical release of the double-A side single ''Permanent/Dream of Me''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/sharptone_records_signs_cardiff_heavyweights_holding_absencewatch_their_new|title=Sharptone Records sign Cardiff heavyweights Holding Absence—watch their new video – News – Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|date=10 February 2017|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref> The following few months were spent touring the UK alongside several bands, including [[Blood Youth]] and [[We Are the Ocean|We Are The Ocean]], before eventually performing at the prestigious [[Download Festival]] in [[Donington Park|Donington]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alreadyheard.com/interview-holding-absence/|title=Interview: Holding Absence|date=17 March 2017}}</ref>

According to Woodland, "the split came about both at a stage in our careers where we could have benefited from releasing music, but also we wanted to do something a little different".<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/interview-holding-absence-27-05-2018/|title=INTERVIEW: Holding Absence (27/05/2018)|website=Dead Press!|date=5 June 2018}}</ref> This tour was Holding Absence's first foray into European territory and on the UK leg the bands opted to hand-pick the support acts for each date, including artists such as Sleep Token, Modern Error and Parting Gift.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://distortedsoundmag.com/interview-lucas-woodland-erik-bickerstaffe-holding-absence-loathe/ | title=INTERVIEW: Lucas Woodland + Erik Bickerstaffe – Holding Absence / Loathe|date=29 March 2018}}</ref>

===2018–2019: Line-up changes and the release of ''Holding Absence''===
Soon after returning from the ''This Is as One'' tour, founding member and guitarist Feisal El-Khazragi left the band,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Holdingabsence/posts/873189219521252|title=Holding Absence|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> it was later announced that he had joined Loathe on bass duties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-loathe-enlist-feisal-el-khazragi-ex-holding-absence-as-new-bassist/|title=NEWS: Loathe enlist Feisal El-Khazragi (ex-Holding Absence) as new bassist!|website=Dead Press!|date=17 May 2018}}</ref>

A new-look Holding Absence (including future guitarists Scott Carey and Chris Smitheram) made their first live appearances at Slam Dunk Festival,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/photos/view/10-photos-of-holding-absence-tearing-up-the-rock-sound-breakout-stage-at-sl|title=10 Photos Of Holding Absence Tearing Up The Rock Sound Breakout Stage At Slam Dunk North – Photos|website=Rock Sound Magazine}}</ref> before jetting off to Europe again, this time to support [[Being as an Ocean|Being As An Ocean]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontview-magazine.be/en/news/holding-absence-to-support-being-as-an-ocean#.XS-ssS3MyLI|title=Holding Absence to support BEING AS AN OCEAN! &#124; FrontView Magazine}}</ref> The band went on to win the Cardiff Music Award for "Best Breakthrough Band",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.native.fm/article/the-cardiff-music-awards-2018-in-pictures|title=The Cardiff Music Awards 2018 in Pictures – native.fm|website=www.native.fm}}</ref> as well as being nominated at the Heavy Music awards for the "Best UK Breakthrough Band".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharptonerecords.co/loathe-holding-absence-nominated-heavy-music-awards-uk/|title=LOATHE & HOLDING ABSENCE NOMINATED FOR HEAVY MUSIC AWARDS UK!|date=27 April 2018|website=SharpTone Records}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> After finishing the summer by playing sporadic UK festivals Holding Absence went on to close the year off with their biggest tour yet supporting fellow UK Post-Hardcore band [[As It Is (band)|As It Is]], alongside [[Trash Boat]] and [[Courage My Love]].<ref name="auto1"/>

In support of this tour, Holding Absence released "Like A Shadow",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharptonerecords.co/holding-absence-release-like-a-shadow-video/|title=HOLDING ABSENCE RELEASE 'LIKE A SHADOW' VIDEO|date=20 November 2018|website=SharpTone Records}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> the first single off the, at the time, unannounced debut album. After the uncertainty with the band's line-up earlier in the year, Like A Shadow was seen as a reintroduction to the band and their new line-up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://killyourstereo.com/news/1104761/holding-absence-move-like-a-shadow-on-newest-single/|title=Holding Absence Move 'Like A Shadow' On Newest Single|first=Alex|last=Sievers|website=Killyourstereo.com}}</ref>

Later in the year, Holding Absence announced their debut, self-titled record would be released on 8 March 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/holding-absence-have-announced-the-details-of-their-debut-album|title=Holding Absence Have Announced The Details Of Their Debut Album – News|website=Rock Sound Magazine}}</ref> They released 3 more singles before the album release, Perish,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharptonerecords.co/holding-absence-release-music-video-for-new-single-perish/|title=HOLDING ABSENCE RELEASE MUSIC VIDEO FOR NEW SINGLE 'PERISH'|date=11 January 2019|website=SharpTone Records}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> You Are Everything<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharptonerecords.co/holding-absence-release-music-video-you-are-everything/|title=HOLDING ABSENCE RELEASE MUSIC VIDEO 'YOU ARE EVERYTHING'|date=15 February 2019|website=SharpTone Records}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> and Monochrome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharptonerecords.co/holding-absence-release-monochrome-music-video/|title=HOLDING ABSENCE RELEASE 'MONOCHROME' MUSIC VIDEO|date=1 March 2019|website=SharpTone Records}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>

Woodland mentions in several interviews how hard the song-writing process was. In regards to El-Khazragi's leaving the band he said that the "line-up change happened not just mid-album, but mid-recording" and how the band "were left having to write and record another half of the album" without him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bringthenoiseuk.com/201903/music/interviews/music-interview-holding-absence-2|title=MUSIC INTERVIEW: Holding Absence|date=6 March 2019}}</ref> The record was also recorded in two parts, which caused the band further complications while trying to get it finished. Woodland believes that the changes benefitted the record in the end, as tracks like "Wilt", "Monochrome" and "Like A Shadow" wouldn't have existed if the band remained in its original form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/interview-holding-absence-27-03-2019/|title=INTERVIEW: Holding Absence (27/03/2019)|website=Dead Press!|date=18 April 2019}}</ref>
