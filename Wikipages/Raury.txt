== Early life ==
Raury Deshawn Tullis was born on June 10, 1996, in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]]. It was at age fourteen when Raury decided that he wanted to work with music for the rest of his life.

Influenced by [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], a lot of his early music was sad, aggressive, and about love. His music told stories and he used music as a tool to express himself.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1957925/who-is-raury/|title=19 Things We Learned About Raury – Including The Origin Of The 'Raury Hat'|work=MTV News|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}</ref> In high school, Raury played guitar in a cover band.
