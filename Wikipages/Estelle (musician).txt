==Early life==
Estelle Swaray was born and raised in [[Hammersmith]], London, England.<ref name="evestd">{{cite web|last= Raphael|first= Amy|title= Hammersmith homegirl Estelle back for more global glory|date= 20 January 2012|website= www.standard.co.uk|url= https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/hammersmith-homegirl-estelle-back-for-more-global-glory-7309991.html}}</ref> Her mother's family came from Dakar, [[Senegal]], and her father is from the Caribbean island of [[Grenada]]. She was the second born of nine children. Estelle's parents were very religious when she was growing up, and [[secular music]] was not allowed in the family's home. Instead, spiritual music—particularly American gospel—and traditional African music were what Estelle grew up listening to. However, she would sometimes listen to hip hop when not at home.<ref name="randb.about.com">{{cite web|url=http://randb.about.com/od/g1/p/Estelle-Swaray.htm |title=Estelle bio |publisher=Randb.about.com |date=18 January 1980 |access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref>

She spent her childhood listening to her parents' reggae records and her aunt's soul collection before discovering hip hop. "I got into hip hop from my uncle; he was always playing us [[Kool G Rap]] and [[Big Daddy Kane]]; he was a bad boy and my mum wasn't really happy that I was hanging out with him".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukhh.com/bhh/artists/estelle-biog.htm |title=Low-Life &#124; Est'elle :: Biography |publisher=Ukhh.com |access-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806070624/http://www.ukhh.com/bhh/artists/estelle-biog.htm |archive-date=6 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> By the time she was in her early 20s, she had decided on a music career. She used to be a child minder before she began her music career. 

== Career ==

=== 2000–2005: Early work and ''The 18th Day'' ===
Estelle got her start in London's renowned hip-hop record store Deal Real. Her fellow employees encouraged her to take a chance and get on the mic on-stage; soon she was playing numerous London clubs and appearing with the likes of Manuva and [[Rodney P]]. Local hero [[DJ Skitz|Skitz]] asked her to appear on his 2000 album, ''Countryman'', and soon she landed on albums by artists such as [[The 57th Dynasty]] and [[Blak Twang]]. She made her solo debut in 2003 with the 12" "Excuse Me", released on the label Paradise Isle.<ref name="itunes.apple.com">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/estelle/id27060010 |title=iTunes Music – Estelle |publisher=iTunes Store |date=18 January 1980 |access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref>

Her career got a jump-start in the early 2000s when she happened to see [[Kanye West]] sitting in a restaurant while on a trip to Los Angeles. Estelle approached Kanye, introduced herself and asked for an introduction to [[John Legend]]. She eventually got that introduction, and Legend eventually helped produce two songs on her debut album,<ref name="about1">{{cite web|url=http://randb.about.com/od/g1/p/Estelle-Swaray.htm |title=Estelle bio |publisher=Randb.about.com |access-date=24 April 2012}}</ref> ''[[The 18th Day]]'', which was released in the UK in October 2004.<ref name="randb.about.com" /> Her breakthrough track came when "[[1980 (Estelle song)|1980]]" was released by the V2 label and reached number 14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. A street-level mixtape series called ''Da Heat'' and further 12"s like "Free" and "Go Gone" helped build a loyal following, and Estelle gave back to the UK hip hop scene by forming her own Stellarents label to sign new artists.  The album was a modest success, debuting at No. 35 on the UK albums chart, and generating two top 20 singles. She received a [[MOBO Awards|MOBO (Music of Black Origin)]] Award in the UK for Best Newcomer.<ref name="randb.about.com" /><ref name="itunes.apple.com" />

===2008–2009: ''Shine'' and mainstream success===
[[File:Estelle in Zac Posen.jpg|thumb|Estelle during the campaign ''Heart Truth'' sponsored by the [[National Heart Forum]] and Blood Institute for heart disease in 2009.]]
Three years later, US R&B singer [[John Legend]] announced that Estelle would be the first signee to his Homeschool label, distributed by [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] in the US. Four years after ''The 18th Day''{{'}}s release, Estelle returned with her second album, ''Shine''. Though it was her second album, it was the first to be released in the US and her major-label debut.

[[Kanye West]], [[Swizz Beatz]], [[Wyclef Jean]], [[Will.i.am]], [[Mark Ronson]] and [[Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections|Cee-Lo Green]] and [[Jack Splash]] all worked on the album, which was executive produced by [[John Legend]]. "Her sound is a unique blend of hip hop, R&B, reggae and soul," explains Legend. "She has a special voice, unlike any other voice out there in mainstream music, and she can really write. She writes hip lyrics with unforgettable melodies. I recognised that in her when I first worked with her in 2004." He continues, "I'm excited and honored to have Estelle as the first artist on my label, Homeschool Records. I believe the world is going to fall in love with her album, as I already have. Estelle is an amazing talent, and she's going to do big things."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.take40.com/artists/1877/estelle/bio |title=Estelle – Biography, Overview, Music Video & Songs, News, Facts |publisher=Take 40 |access-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220920/http://www.take40.com/artists/1877/estelle/bio |archive-date=27 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Estelle confirmed her third album would be titled ''[[All of Me (Estelle album)|All of Me]]''.
