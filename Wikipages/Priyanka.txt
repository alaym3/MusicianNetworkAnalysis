 
'''''Priyanka''''' is a popular female given name in [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] cultures. It is a name derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word 'Priyankera' or 'Priyankara', meaning someone or something that is amiable, lovable, or makes you happy and very talkative.<ref>[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=priyaMkara&script=&direction=SE&link=yes SpokenSanskrit.de Dictionary translation of the word 'priyamkar'.]</ref> In its [[adverb]] form it can also mean endearing behavior, for example an act of showing kindness or happiness or excitement; or kind agree-ability. 

The [[Sanskrit]] word Priyankara is also used to describe the white variety of the 'Kantakari' flower (Sweta kantakari). Some of the earliest mentions of the Kantakari flower can be found in the ancient [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Ayurveda]] text from the mid-second millennium [[BCE]].
