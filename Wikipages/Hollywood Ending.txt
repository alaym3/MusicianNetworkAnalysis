'''''Hollywood Ending''''' is a 2002 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Woody Allen]], who also plays the principal character. It tells the story of a once-famous [[film director]] who suffers [[conversion disorder|hysterical blindness]] due to the intense pressure of directing.

==Plot==
Val Waxman is a once-prestigious film director who now directs television commercials. When he is thrown off his latest effort (a deodorant commercial filmed in the frozen north of Canada), he desperately seeks a real movie project.

Out of the blue, Val receives an offer to direct a big-budget blockbuster to be set in New York City. However, the offer comes from his former wife, Ellie, and her boyfriend, Hal, the studio head who stole her from Val years ago.

Pushed by his agent Al Hack, Val reluctantly agrees to the project, but a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic ailment]] strikes him blind just before production is to begin. With Al's encouragement and aid, Val keeps his blindness a secret from the cast and crew (and Hal). During filming, Val rekindles his relationship with Ellie and reconnects with his estranged son, Tony, while his much younger girlfriend, Lori, leaves him. When Val regains what had been missing his life, he regains his sight as well, and realizes that the movie he directed while blind is a disaster.

Sure enough, the movie flops - but is a hit in France, where he is invited to direct a film. After winning Ellie back, he happily proclaims, "Thank God the French exist."

==Production notes==

[[Haskell Wexler]] was the original cinematographer, but was fired by Woody Allen after a week of filming as they couldn't agree on how to film certain shots.

The film received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that the film received 46% positive reviews, based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 5.42/10. The website's critics consensus states: "Although ''Hollywood Ending'' contains some zany one-liners, its promising premise is far from developed."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hollywood_ending|title=Hollywood Ending (2002)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=9 July 2020|archive-date=27 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927094544/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hollywood_ending|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 46 out of 100, based on 37 reviews.<ref>{{metacritic film|id=hollywood-ending|title=Hollywood Ending}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B-" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |title=Home - Cinemascore |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |website=Cinemascore |access-date=28 December 2019 |archive-date=12 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212150805/https://www.cinemascore.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Film critic Bryant Frazer thought that it suffered from poor editing. He wrote, "What's most frustrating is the sense that ''Hollywood Ending'' could have been quite a bit better than it actually is. At 114 minutes, it's decisively lacking in the brevity that used to characterize Allen's pictures&mdash;even the super-serious, [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]]-inspired stuff. Worse, his timing seems to be off&mdash;the filmmaker who was once notorious for cutting his films to the absolute bone now gives us rambling, overlong shots featuring performers who almost seem to be ad libbing their dialogue. I ran to the [[Internet Movie Database]] to investigate, and discovered what may be the problem&mdash;[[Susan E. Morse|Susan Morse]] is gone. Morse, the editor who had worked with Allen since ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' in 1979 and who turned into a real soldier by the time of the jazzy montage that characterized ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'', was reportedly a victim of budget-cutting within the ranks."<ref>{{cite web |last=Frazer |first=Bryant |title=Hollywood Ending |url=http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/hollywoo.html |work=Deep Focus  |access-date=2009-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616164000/http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/hollywoo.html |archive-date=2016-06-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
