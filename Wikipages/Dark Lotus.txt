'''Dark Lotus''' was an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[group (music)|group]] based in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], United States. Formed in 1998 as a side project of [[Insane Clown Posse]] and [[Twiztid]], Dark Lotus was best known as a representative of the [[horrorcore]] subgenre. From 1998 to 2017, Dark Lotus' lineup changed multiple times, with the most consistent members of the group being [[Violent J]], [[Shaggy 2 Dope]], [[Jamie Madrox (rapper)|Jamie Madrox]], [[Monoxide Child|Monoxide]] and [[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]].

==History==
Initially in 1998, Dark Lotus was announced as a supergroup of artists that were currently signed to [[Psychopathic Records]]. In addition to the official [[hotline]], it was also publicly announced in an exclusive interview with [[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]. The original members were Insane Clown Posse (Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J), Twiztid (Jamie Madrox and Monoxide Child), and [[Myzery]]. The idea stemmed from the five artists recording the collaboration song "Meat Cleaver" on Twiztid's 1998 debut album ''[[Mostasteless]]''. After Myzery distanced himself from Psychopathic Records, the remaining four members made its official Dark Lotus debut with the single "Echoside"<ref name="BehindthePaint560">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |author-link=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/n571 560]–561 |chapter=Complete Discography }}</ref> which was originally intended for the group's debut, but released on [[Insane Clown Posse]]'s 1999 album ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]'' instead, because the Dark Lotus album's production took longer than expected.<ref name="BehindthePaint560"/>

The group attempted to add [[Esham]] as the official fifth member, with various interviews confirming his inclusion. In the demo version of the song "Whut?" from Insane Clown Posse's album ''[[Bizaar]]'', Esham mentioned in the lyrics joining the supergroup; however, he was replaced by Twiztid in the final version, and ultimately had not stayed in the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://faygoluvers.net/v5/2015/05/unreleased-underground-the-hatchet-family/|title=Unreleased Underground (selection of rare and unreleased songs)|website=Faygoluvers.net}}</ref> It was then announced that [[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]] would become the official fifth member of Dark Lotus. It was later announced that each member "would act as a 'petal' of the lotus",<ref name="Allrovi">[https://archive.today/20120721142230/http://www.allrovi.com/name/dark-lotus-mn0000956747]</ref> and that there would be six members. Another attempt at a new member came about with professional wrestler [[Vampiro]]. Both Blaze Ya Dead Homie and Vampiro appeared on the track "Maniac Killa" off of Twiztid's second album ''[[Freek Show]]'', along with Insane Clown Posse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Twiztid-Freek-Show/release/507913|title=Freek Show album credits|website=Discogs.com}}</ref> The track was credited to Dark Lotus. The following year, it was announced that [[Marz (rapper)|Marz]] would be a member, thus replacing Vampiro, and cementing himself as the sixth member.<ref name="Allrovi"/>

Dark Lotus released their first album, ''[[Tales from the Lotus Pod|Tales From the Lotus Pod]]'', in 2001. [[Mike E. Clark]] was brought in to produce the album, but left the project after producing four songs. Twiztid, Fritz the Cat, and Mike P of [[Zug Izland]] finished the remainder of the album.<ref name="BehindthePaint470">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |author-link=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/470 470–496] |chapter=Hatchet Rising }}</ref> The album peaked at #1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Heatseekers [[Billboard charts|chart]], #6 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #158 on the [[Billboard 200]].<ref name="Charts">[https://archive.today/20120721142230/http://www.allrovi.com/name/dark-lotus-mn0000956747] </ref> Later in the year, Marz left the group, and was replaced by [[Anybody Killa]].

In 2002, ''Tales From the Lotus Pod'' was reissued in a new version removing Marz's vocals.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe |last=D'Angelo |title=Insane Clown Posse Axed By Label, Launching Tour |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449157/20010925/i_c_p.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=September 25, 2001 |access-date=November 3, 2008 }}</ref> On April 6, 2004, Dark Lotus released their second studio album, ''[[Black Rain (Dark Lotus album)|Black Rain]]''. It peaked at #3 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and at #71 on the Billboard 200.<ref name="Charts"/> In the ensuing years, various Dark Lotus non-album tracks appeared on other Psychopathic Records releases, such as the ''[[Psychopathics From Outer Space]]'' and ''[[Cryptic Collection]]'' compilations.

Afterwards, Anybody Killa left the group, and a third album, ''[[The Opaque Brotherhood]]'', on April 15, 2008 was released without him.<ref name="Allrovi"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realdetroitweekly.com/article_1954.shtml |title=The Calm Before the Storm |access-date=July 14, 2008 |last=Bonaventura |first=Andrea |date=October 25, 2006 |publisher=[[Real Detroit Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017105348/http://realdetroitweekly.com/article_1954.shtml |archive-date=October 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It peaked at #4 on the Top Independent Albums chart, #23 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, #45 on the Top Internet Albums chart, and #45 on the Billboard 200.<ref name="Charts"/> [[Allrovi]] reviewer Stewart Mason praised the album, writing "Nothing on ''The Opaque Brotherhood'' will convince anyone who isn't already a fan, but the tormented lyrics and matter-of-fact delivery remove a layer or two of distance and artifice from the band's familiar themes, and make them that much more disturbing as a result."<ref>[https://archive.today/20120721142230/http://www.allrovi.com/name/dark-lotus-mn0000956747]</ref> Twiztid left Psychopathic Records on December 13, 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tweetmesohard|title=Twiztid (@tweetmesohard) - Twitter|website=Twitter.com}}</ref> but according to Violent J, Dark Lotus had not broken up and would continue to release music on Psychopathic Records as time permits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insaneclownposse.com|title=ICP - The Insane Clown Posse|website=Insaneclownposse.com}}</ref>

It was announced on February 18, 2014 that all five members of Dark Lotus were in the studio together recording a new album. This would have been the group's first album since 2008's ''The Opaque Brotherhood''. It was released at the 15th annual [[Gathering of the Juggalos]], entitled ''[[The Mud, Water, Air & Blood]]''. The album peaked at #43 on the Billboard 200, the group's highest number to date. Former member Anybody Killa was a guest feature on the track "Villainous", thus bringing the six artists together again.

At the 2016 Gathering of the Juggalos, during Insane Clown Posse's seminar, it was announced that at the ''2017 Juggalo Day Show'' Dark Lotus would perform ''Tales From the Lotus Pod'' in its entirety. On January 19, 2017 via an interview with [[Faygoluvers]], Insane Clown Posse announced that it was cutting ties with Twiztid and [[Majik Ninja Entertainment]], and that all artists from Majik Ninja Entertainment were removed from the ''2017 Juggalo Day Show'' and that a new lineup would be announced soon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faygoluvers.net/v5/2017/01/icp-announces-that-twiztidmne-will-not-be-at-juggalo-day-or-the-gathering/|title=ICP Announces that Twiztid/MNE will not be at Juggalo Day or the Gathering; Twiztid Shop VIP News |website=Faygoluvers.net}}</ref>

On July 21, 2018 at the 2018 Gathering of the Juggalos, Violent J announced at the Insane Clown Posse seminar that “We will never reunite with Twiztid. Ever." They also stated that Dark Lotus would not continue and that there wouldn't be any disses towards them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://faygoluvers.net/v5/2018/07/notes-from-the-2018-insane-clown-posse-gathering-seminar/|title=Notes from the 2018 Insane Clown Posse Gathering Seminar|website=Faygoluvers.net}}</ref> These statements, along with various other factors involving both Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid, confirmed the end of the supergroup.

Afterwards, Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie occasionally performed their verses from popular Dark Lotus songs during live performances, usually referring to themselves simply as "Lotus".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190710175824/https://faygoluvers.net/v5/2019/07/catch-twiztid-blaze-performing-dark-lotus-tracks-on-the-2nd-leg-of-the-generation-nightmare-tour/] </ref>

==Music and lyrics==
Kimberly Chun of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' described Dark Lotus' musical style as a mixture of "[[Dub music|dub]], [[Gothic rock|goth]], [[Heavy metal music|metal]], shock rock and hip-hop, with a [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] announcer's delivery and shuffling stoner beats thrown in for good measure."<ref>{{cite news |first=Kimberly |last=Chun |title=''Hip-hop on pop at Insane Clown Posse plus Paula West and Basement Jaxx'' |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2001/10/10/musicreviews.DTL |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=October 10, 2001 |access-date=July 23, 2008 }}</ref> Much of Dark Lotus' lyrics revolve around the [[occult]].<ref name=Allrovi/>
