'''Bread''' is a [[staple food]] prepared from a [[dough]] of [[flour]] (usually [[wheat]]) and water, usually by [[baking]]. Throughout [[recorded history]], it has been a prominent food in large parts of the world. It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of significant importance since the dawn of [[Agriculture#History|agriculture]], and plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.

Bread may be [[Leavening agent|leavened]] by naturally occurring microbes (e.g. sourdough), chemicals (e.g. baking soda), industrially produced [[Baker's yeast|yeast]], or high-pressure aeration, which creates the gas bubbles that fluff up bread. In many countries, commercial bread often contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.

An early [[leavened bread]] was baked as early as 6000 BC by the [[Sumerians]], who may have passed on their knowledge to the Egyptians around 3000 BC. The Egyptians refined the process and started adding [[yeast]] to the [[flour]]. The Sumerians were already using [[ash]] to supplement the dough as it was baked.<ref name=arzani11>Arzani A.: ''Emmer (Triticum turgidum spp. dicoccum) flour and breads''.

There were multiple sources of [[leavening]] available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. [[Pliny the Elder]] reported that the [[Gauls]] and [[Iberians]] used the foam skimmed from [[beer]], called [[barm]], to produce "a lighter kind of bread than other peoples" such as [[barm cake]]. Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of [[grape]] juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in [[wine]], as a source for [[yeast]]. The most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough [[Bread starter|starter]], as Pliny also reported.<ref>{{cite book | first=Reay | last=Tannahill | year=1973 | title=Food in History | publisher=Stein and Day | isbn=978-0-8128-1437-8 |pages=68–69}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Pliny the Elder |title=Natural History |date=1938 |publisher=Loeb Classics |pages=1.255 |url=http://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL371.255.xml?readMode=recto |quote=Generally however they do not heat it up at all, but only use the dough kept over from the day before; manifestly it is natural for sourness to make the dough ferment}}</ref>

The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans all considered the degree of refinement in the bakery arts as a sign of civilization.<ref name=arzani11/>

The [[Chorleywood bread process]] was developed in 1961; it uses the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] period and the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of grain with a lower protein content, is now widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However, there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120522022319/http://www.allotment.org.uk/recipes/bread-making/chorleywood-process Chorleywood Industrial Bread Making Process]. allotment.org.uk</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-13670278 bbc.com: "Chorleywood: The bread that changed Britain"], 7 Jun 2011</ref><ref>[https://www.fob.uk.com/about-the-bread-industry/history-of-bread-antiquity/history-bread-20th-century/ fob.co.uk: "History of bread – 20th century"]</ref>

Bread is the [[staple food]] of the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Europe]], and in European-derived cultures such as those in the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], and [[Southern Africa]]. This is in contrast to parts of South and East Asia, where [[rice]] or [[noodles]] are the staple. Bread is usually made from a [[wheat]]-[[flour]] [[dough]] that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an [[oven]]. The addition of yeast to the bread explains the air pockets commonly found in bread.<ref>[http://www.quakeroats.com/cooking-and-recipes/content/baking-101/yeast-breads/common-yeast-bread-issues/air-holes-or-tunnels-inside.aspx Air Holes or Tunnels Inside] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119225822/http://www.quakeroats.com/cooking-and-recipes/content/baking-101/yeast-breads/common-yeast-bread-issues/air-holes-or-tunnels-inside.aspx |date=19 November 2017 }}. quakeroats.com</ref> Owing to its high levels of [[gluten]] (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity), [[common wheat|common or bread wheat]] is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread, which makes the largest single contribution to the world's food supply of any food.<ref name="FAO">{{cite web |last1=Peña |first1=R.

[[Gluten-free diet#Gluten-free bread|Gluten-free breads]] are made using flours from a variety of ingredients such as almonds, rice, sorghum, corn, legumes such as beans, and tubers such as cassava. Since these foods lack gluten, dough made from them may not hold its shape as the loaves rise, and their crumb may be dense with little aeration.

Bread crust is formed from surface dough during the cooking process. It is hardened and browned through the [[Maillard reaction]] using the sugars and amino acids due to the intense heat at the bread surface. The crust of most breads is harder, and more complexly and intensely flavored, than the rest. [[Old wives' tale]]s suggest that eating the bread crust makes a person's hair curlier.<ref>''The Longevity List: Myth Busting the Top Ways to Live a Long and Healthy Life'' {{ISBN|978-1-921966-73-6}} p. 156</ref> Additionally, the crust is rumored to be healthier than the remainder of the bread.

Doughs are usually [[baked]], but in some cuisines breads are [[steamed bread|steamed]] (e.g., [[mantou]]), fried (e.g., [[puri (food)|puri]]), or baked on an unoiled [[frying pan]] (e.g., [[tortilla]]s). It may be [[leavening agent|leavened]] or unleavened (e.g. [[matzo]]). [[Edible salt|Salt]], [[fat]] and [[leavening agent]]s such as [[yeast (baking)|yeast]] and [[baking soda]] are common ingredients, though bread may contain other ingredients, such as [[milk]], [[egg (food)|egg]], [[sugar]], [[spice]], [[fruit]] (such as [[raisin]]s), [[vegetable]]s (such as [[onion]]), [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] (such as [[walnut]]) or [[seed]]s (such as [[poppy seed|poppy]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bread recipes (45 results found)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/search|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=2 October 2016|archive-date=24 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924091333/http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/search|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Formulation===
Professional bread recipes are stated using the [[baker percentage|baker's percentage]] notation. The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, and the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most. Hard wheat flours [[Farinograph#Method|absorb]] about 62% [[water]], while softer wheat flours absorb about 56%.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Finley, John H. |author2=Phillips, R. O. |title=Protein quality and the effects of processing |publisher=M. Dekker |location=New York |year=1989|page=See Figure 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYjWtWt5O9IC&pg=PA371 |isbn=978-0-8247-7984-9}}</ref> Common table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured, light bread. Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water. In yeast breads, the higher water percentages result in more CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles and a coarser bread crumb. 500 [[gram]]s (1 pound) of flour yields a standard loaf of bread or two [[baguette]]s.

[[Calcium propionate]] is commonly added by commercial bakeries to retard the growth of molds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calcium Propionate|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1123/Calcium-Propionate.html|publisher=JRank|access-date=1 October 2016}}</ref>

===Flour===
{{Main|Flour}}

[[Flour]] is grain ground to a powdery consistency. Flour provides the primary structure, starch and protein to the final baked bread. The [[protein]] content of the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread [[dough]] and the finished bread. While bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour, a specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12–14%), is recommended for high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9–11%) to produce bread, a shorter mixing time is required to develop gluten strength properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hamelman, Jeffrey  |title=Bread: a baker's book of techniques and recipes |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=7–13 |quote=A high gluten white flour will require more mix time than a white flour with a lower gluten content,... |isbn=978-0-471-16857-7 }}</ref>

Wheat flour, in addition to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein groups ([[albumin]], [[globulin]], and [[proteose]]s) and two water-insoluble protein groups ([[glutenin]] and [[gliadin]]). When flour is mixed with water, the water-soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by [[kneading]], or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see [[no-knead bread]]), the glutenin forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin. The resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as [[gluten]]. Gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to [[autolyse]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=Gary |last2=Carey |first2=Patrick |last3=Tinton |first3=Terry |last4=Walpole |first4=Steven |title=Professional Chef: Level 2 Diploma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iGHqXWigQ4C&pg=RA17-PA10 |year=2007 |publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA |isbn=978-1-84480-706-2 |pages=10–11}}</ref>

===Liquids===
Water, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough. The weight or ratio of liquid required varies between recipes, but a ratio of three parts liquid to five parts flour is common for yeast breads.<ref>[http://food.laurieashton.com/2009/06/bakers-percentages-and-bread-hydration/ Hydration ratio for breads] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114151320/http://food.laurieashton.com/2009/06/bakers-percentages-and-bread-hydration/ |date=14 January 2013 }}. Food.laurieashton.com (5 June 2009). Retrieved 21 March 2013.</ref> Recipes that use steam as the primary leavening method may have a liquid content in excess of one part liquid to one part flour. Instead of water, recipes may use liquids such as milk or other [[dairy product]]s (including [[buttermilk]] or [[yogurt]]), fruit juice, or eggs. These contribute additional sweeteners, fats, or leavening components, as well as water.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yeast & Baking Lessongs. Liquids|url=http://redstaryeast.com/yeast-baking-lessons/common-baking-ingredients/liquids/|publisher=Red Star Yeast|access-date=2 October 2016}}</ref>

===Fats or shortenings===
Fats, such as butter, vegetable oils, lard, or that contained in eggs, affect the development of gluten in breads by coating and lubricating the individual strands of protein. They also help to hold the structure together. If too much fat is included in a bread dough, the lubrication effect causes the protein structures to divide. A fat content of approximately 3% by weight is the concentration that produces the greatest leavening action.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Young, Linda |author2=Cauvain, Stanley P. |title=Technology of Breadmaking |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |page=54 |isbn=978-0-387-38563-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXtJivmeDfcC&pg=PA54}}</ref> In addition to their effects on leavening, fats also serve to tenderize breads and preserve freshness.

===Bread improvers===
{{Main|Bread improver}}

[[Bread improver]]s and [[dough conditioner]]s are often used in producing commercial breads to reduce the time needed for rising and to improve texture and volume. The substances used may be oxidising agents to strengthen the dough or reducing agents to develop gluten and reduce mixing time, emulsifiers to strengthen the dough or to provide other properties such as making slicing easier, or enzymes to increase gas production.<ref name=Tenbergen>{{cite web |last=Tenbergen |first=Klaus |title=Dough and Bread Conditioners |url=http://www.foodingredientsonline.com/doc.mvc/Dough-and-Bread-Conditioners-0001?VNETCOOKIE=NO |work=Food and Product Design Magazine |date=1999 |access-date=2 October 2016}}</ref>

===Salt===
Salt ([[sodium chloride]]) is very often added to enhance flavor and restrict yeast activity. It also affects the crumb and the overall texture by stabilizing and strengthening<ref>Silverton, Nancy (1996) ''Breads From The La Brea Bakery'', Villard, {{ISBN|0-679-40907-6}}</ref> the gluten. Some artisan bakers forego early addition of salt to the dough, whether wholemeal or refined, and wait until after a 20-minute rest to allow the dough to [[autolyse]].<ref>Reinhart, Peter (2001) ''The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread'', Ten Speed Press, {{ISBN|1-58008-268-8}}</ref>

Mixtures of salts are sometimes employed, such as employing [[potassium chloride]] to reduce the sodium level, and [[monosodium glutamate]] to give flavor ([[umami]]).

==Leavening==
<!--Photian schism links here -->
[[File:Aberdour Castle - Dough Trough.jpg|thumb|A dough trough, located in [[Aberdour Castle]], once used for leavening bread.]]

[[Leavening]] is the process of adding gas to a dough before or during baking to produce a lighter, more easily chewed bread. Most bread eaten in the West is leavened.<ref name=BAC>{{cite web|title=The Bread Leavening Process|url=http://becomingachef.co.uk/bread-leavening-agents-sourdough-starter/|website=Becoming a Chef|access-date=2 October 2016|date=2016-08-15}}</ref>

===Chemicals===
A simple technique for leavening bread is the use of gas-producing chemicals.  There are two common methods. The first is to use [[baking powder]] or a [[self-raising flour]] that includes baking powder.  The second is to include an acidic ingredient such as [[buttermilk]] and add [[baking soda]]; the reaction of the acid with the soda produces gas.<ref name=BAC/> Chemically leavened breads are called ''[[quick bread]]s'' and ''[[soda bread]]s''. This method is commonly used to make [[muffin]]s, [[pancake]]s, American-style [[biscuits]], and quick breads such as [[banana bread]].

===Yeast===
{{Main|Baker's yeast}}
[[File:Compressed fresh yeast - 1.jpg|right|thumb|Compressed fresh yeast]]

Many breads are leavened by [[yeast]]. The yeast most commonly used for leavening bread is ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the same species used for brewing alcoholic beverages. This yeast [[Fermentation|ferments]] some of the [[carbohydrate]]s in the flour, including any [[sugar]], producing [[carbon dioxide]]. Commercial bakers often leaven their dough with commercially produced [[baker's yeast]]. Baker's yeast has the advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is obtained from a [[pure culture]].<ref name=BAC/> Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast with a growth culture. If kept in the right conditions, it provides leavening for many years.<ref name="isbn0-387-38563-0-cite4">{{cite book |author1=Young, Linda |author2=Cauvain, Stanley P. |title=Technology of Breadmaking |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-387-38563-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXtJivmeDfcC&pg=PA79}}</ref>

The baker's yeast and [[sourdough]] methods follow the same pattern. Water is mixed with flour, salt and the leavening agent. Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed dough is then allowed to [[Proofing (baking technique)|rise]] one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor, so bakers often "punch down" the dough and let it rise again), loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an [[oven]].<ref name=BAC/>

Many breads are made from a "[[straight dough]]", which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time;<ref name=BAC/> others are made from a "[[pre-ferment]]" in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of baking, the rest of the ingredients are added, and the process continues as with straight dough. This produces a more flavorful bread with better texture. Many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the reliable results of baker's yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker's yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories: "[[poolish]]" or "pouliche", a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight); "[[biga (bread baking)|biga]]", a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour; and "pâte fermentée", which is simply a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artisan bread baking tips: Poolish & biga|url=https://www.weekendbakery.com/posts/more-artisan-bread-baking-tips-poolish-biga/|website=Weekend Bakery|access-date=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Preferments|publisher=King Arthur Flour}}</ref>

===Sourdough===
{{Main|Sourdough}}
[[File:Sour dough loaves03.jpg|thumb|Sourdough loaves]]

Sourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using naturally occurring yeasts and [[Lactobacillus|lactobacilli]]. It usually has a mildly sour taste because of the [[lactic acid]] produced during [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] [[fermentation]] by the lactobacilli.<ref name=DavidsonSourdough>{{cite book | first=Alan | last=Davidson | year=1999 | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-211579-9 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/756 756–57] | url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/756 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor1=Gobbetti, Marco |editor2=Gänzle, Michael |date=2012 |title=Handbook on Sourdough Biotechnology |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4899-9189-8}}</ref>

Sourdough breads are made with a sourdough starter. The starter cultivates yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water, making use of the microorganisms already present on flour; it does not need any added yeast. A starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water. Some bakers have starters many generations old, which are said to have a special taste or texture.<ref name=DavidsonSourdough/> At one time, all yeast-leavened breads were sourdoughs. Recently there has been a revival of sourdough bread in artisan bakeries.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mesure|first1=Susie|title=Supermarkets cash in on sourdough bread craze as popularity surges |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/supermarkets-cash-in-on-sourdough-bread-craze-as-popularity-surges-a6844101.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=2 October 2016|date=30 January 2016}}</ref>

Traditionally, peasant families throughout Europe baked on a fixed schedule, perhaps once a week. The starter was saved from the previous week's dough. The starter was mixed with the new ingredients, the dough was left to rise, and then a piece of it was saved (to be the starter for next week's bread).<ref name=BAC/>

===Steam===
The rapid expansion of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which is as simple as it is unpredictable.  Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens regardless of the raising agents (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix. The leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide. The heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough. The steam expands and makes the bread rise. This is the main factor in the rising of bread once it has been put in the oven.<ref>{{cite book |author=Edwards, W.P.|title=The science of bakery products |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge |year=2007 |page=68 |isbn=978-0-85404-486-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCVPjK0mSfkC&pg=PA68|quote=When bread expands in the oven the resulting expansion is known as oven spring.  It has been calculated that water expansion was responsible for some 60% of the expansion. |access-date=8 December 2012}}</ref> [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] generation, on its own, is too small to account for the rise. Heat kills bacteria or yeast at an early stage, so the CO<sub>2</sub> generation is stopped.

===Bacteria===
[[Salt-rising bread]] employs a form of [[bacteria]]l leavening that does not require yeast. Although the leavening action is inconsistent, and requires close attention to the [[incubator (culture)|incubating]] conditions, this bread is making a comeback for its cheese-like flavor and fine texture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~petsonk/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630212428/http://home.comcast.net/~petsonk/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 June 2012 |title=Susan R. Brown's Salt Rising Bread Project |publisher=Home.comcast.net |access-date=3 June 2010 }}</ref>

===Aeration===
[[Aerated bread]] was leavened by carbon dioxide being forced into dough under pressure. From the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, bread made this way was somewhat popular in the United Kingdom, made by the [[Aerated Bread Company]] and sold in its high-street [[Aerated Bread Company#Tea shops and early women's issues|tearooms]]. The company was founded in 1862, and ceased independent operations in 1955.<ref name=memoir>[[Benjamin Ward Richardson|Richardson MD FRS, Benjanmin Ward]].

The Pressure-Vacuum mixer was later developed by the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association for the [[Chorleywood bread process]]. It manipulates the gas bubble size and optionally the composition of gases in the dough via the gas applied to the headspace.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Kilcast, D. |editor2=McKenna, B.

== Culture==
===Etymology===
The [[Old English language|Old English]] word for bread was ''hlaf'' (''hlaifs'' in [[Gothic language|Gothic]]: modern English ''[[loaf]]''), which appears to be the oldest [[Germanic languages|Teutonic]] name.<ref name=etym/> [[Old High German]] ''hleib''<ref>{{Cite book |last=Diakonov |first=Igor M. |title=The Paths of History |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-521-64398-6 |page=79 |quote=Slavic langues retain many Gothic words, reflecting cultural borrowings: thus ''khleb'', (bread) from an earlier ''khleiba'' from Gothic ''hlaifs'', or, rather, from the more ancient form ''hlaibhaz'', which meant bread baked in an oven (and, probably, made with yeast), as different from a l-iepekha, which was a flat cake moulded (liepiti) from paste, and baked on charcoal. [the same nominal stem *hlaibh- has been preserved in modern English as loaf; cf. Lord, from ancient ''hlafweard'' bread-keeper]}}</ref> and modern [[German language|German]] ''Laib'' derive from this [[Proto-Germanic]] word, which was borrowed into some Slavic ([[Czech language|Czech]] ''chléb'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''bochen chleba'', [[Russian language|Russian]] ''khleb'') and Finnic ([[Finnish (language)|Finnish]] ''leipä'', [[Estonian language|Estonian]] ''leib'') languages as well.
The [[Middle English|Middle]] and [[Modern English]] word bread appears in [[Germanic language]]s, such as [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''brea'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''brood'', [[German language|German]] ''Brot'', [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]] ''bröd'', and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] ''brød''; it may be related to ''[[brewing|brew]]'' or perhaps to ''break'', originally meaning "broken piece", "morsel".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dean |first=Sam |title=The Etymology of the Word 'Bread' |url=http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/ingredients/article/the-etymology-of-the-word-bread |access-date=30 September 2016 |website=Bon Appetit|date=2 August 2013 }}{{better source needed|date=August 2021}}</ref>

===Cultural significance===

{{main|Bread in culture}}

[[Bread in culture|Bread has a significance beyond mere nutrition in many cultures]] because of its history and contemporary importance. Bread is also [[sacramental bread|significant in Christianity]] as one of the elements (alongside [[wine]]) of the [[Eucharist]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9033174/Eucharist Eucharist (Christianity) – Encyclopædia Britannica]</ref> and in other religions including [[Paganism]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Sabrina, Lady |title=Exploring Wicca: The Beliefs, Rites, and Rituals of the Wiccan Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeRKlCbOdnIC&pg=PA100 |year=2006 |publisher=Career Press |isbn=978-1-56414-884-1 |pages=100–}}</ref>

In many [[culture]]s, bread is a [[metaphor]] for basic necessities and living conditions in general. For example, a "bread-winner" is a household's main economic contributor and has little to do with actual bread-provision. This is also seen in the phrase "putting bread on the table". The Roman poet [[Juvenal]] satirized superficial politicians and the public as caring only for "''panem et circenses''" ([[bread and circuses]]).<ref>[[Juvenal#Literary and cultural influence|Juvenal's literary and cultural influence (Book IV: Satire 10.81)]]</ref> In [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] in 1917, the Bolsheviks promised "peace, land, and bread."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia/38557/The-Civil-War-and-War-Communism-1918-21 |title=Russia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=3 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/biography/lenin/section6.rhtml |title=Vladimir Lenin: From March to October.
