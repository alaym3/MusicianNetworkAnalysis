== History ==
Vasoli expressed interest to Matt Watts, his manager and friend, about doing an electronic project after being inspired by [[LCD Soundsystem]] and other acts at the 2010 [[Bonnaroo]] Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. Watts connected Vasoli to the band [[Body Language (band)|Body Language]] which had a studio based in the neighborhood of [[Bedford Stuyvesant]], Brooklyn called Landau Audio Design (LAD) . After one session the song "Great Love" was started and the musical relationship was established. Subsequent instrumental recordings were started in Brooklyn and sent to Vasoli, who would add vocals and bass guitar. The songs started to take on tropical qualities due to Young's collection of [[Exotica]], [[Polynesia]]n, [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]] and [[Tropicalia]] Records.<ref name="tropicalia">{{cite web|url=http://adavids2.buzznet.com/user/journal/17243195/exclusive-interview-matt-young-kenny|title=Exclusive Interview With Matt Young And Kenny Vasoli Of Vacationer on Lana's Land's Blog |work=buzznet.com|access-date=June 7, 2015}}</ref> Most songs were sketched over email exchanges and then fleshed out at LAD.<ref name="sketch">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/159232-a-night-of-good-vibes-and-interview-with-vacationer-18-may-2012|title=A Night of Good Vibes & Interview with Vacationer: 18 May 2012|work=PopMatters|access-date=June 7, 2015}}</ref>
