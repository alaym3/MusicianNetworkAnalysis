On September 17, 2021, Fox released the second chapter of ''Deltarune'' for free since "the world has been really tough for everybody recently", referring to the struggles of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. He plans to release the next three chapters simultaneously with a price greater than ''Undertale'', but without any projected release date.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://deltarune.com/update-092021 |title=DELTARUNE Status Update Sept 2021 |work=Deltarune |access-date=2021-09-18}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
A native of [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], Fox studied environmental science at [[Northeastern University]].<ref name="Union Leader" /> He suffers from [[Chronic pain|chronic wrist and hand pain]] that regularly disables him from programming and composing; Fox cited a flareup of this pain as a factor in the delayed development of ''Deltarune''{{'s}} second chapter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://undertale.com/deltarune-update-092020/ |title=DELTARUNE Status Update – September 2020 |date=September 15, 2020 |access-date=January 20, 2021 |archive-date=January 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210120033544/https://undertale.com/deltarune-update-092020/ |url-status=live}}</ref>
