'''Flobots''' is an [[experimental music|experimental]] [[rap rock]] band from [[Denver, Colorado]], formed in 2005 by [[Jamie Laurie]]. The band's origins date back 5 years earlier to a similar project by Laurie. Flobots found mainstream success with their major label debut ''[[Fight with Tools]]'' (2007), featuring the single "[[Handlebars (song)|Handlebars]]", which became a popular hit on [[Modern Rock Tracks|Modern Rock radio]] in April 2008. The band has released four studio albums and one EP, with their latest ''[[Noenemies]]'' being released in May 2017.

==History==
=== Origins (2000–2005)===
The origins of the Flobots project started in 2000, when Jamie "Jonny&nbsp;5" Laurie teamed with producer Farhad Ebrahimi, a.k.a. Yahktoe. Together they released ''[[Onomatopoeia (album)|Onomatopoeia]]'' in 2001, and the title track ended up in a compilation by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Songwriting Club at Yahktoe's alma mater. The title track featured guitar player David Gralow, [[cello]] player Terrence Favors, and bass player Jaymz Haynes.

=== ''Platypus'' and ''Fight with Tools'' (2005–2008)===
[[file:Flobots 121 (4178522301).jpg|thumb|Flobots in 2009.]]
After the release of ''Onomatopoeia'', the project went on a hiatus. In 2005, Laurie reformed the project under the name The Flobots. Joining Laurie was MC/vocalist Stephen "Brer Rabbit" Brackett, bassist Jesse Walker, guitarist Andy Guerrero, trumpet player Joe Ferrone, viola player Mackenzie Gault, and drummer Kenny Ortiz. Guerrero and Ferrone were previously in the band Bop Skizzum together. With a revamped lineup, Flobots released their debut EP under the new name ''[[Flobots Present...Platypus]]'', which went on to sell more than 3,000 copies over the next two years.

After the release of ''Platypus'', Flobots began work on their next album. After a year of writing and producing, the Flobots released their proper debut album ''[[Fight with Tools]]'' and sold out their CD release show at the Gothic Theatre in [[Englewood, Colorado]]. A [[Denver Post]] survey of music critics ranked Flobots the 51st best independent band in all of Colorado in late 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2007/08/02/2007-underground-music-showcase/|title=2007 Underground Music Showcase – The Denver Post|access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref>

Flobots entered a contest held by Denver radio station 93.3 ([[KTCL]]), called Hometown for the Holidays, which allowed fans to vote for their favorite songs from 35 local bands. Flobots subsequently won both the radio portion of the contest as well as the [[concert|live performance]] award. As a result, the station put "Handlebars" into full rotation at the end of January due to the immense popularity of the song during the contest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/musicheadlines/ci_8254402|title=Denverpost.com, Flobots hammer home message | work=Denver Post | date=February 15, 2008}}</ref>

It was after this show that the group was approached by and subsequently signed to [[Universal Republic]] on a two CD major label deal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_8707202|title=Denverpost.com, Flobots take giant step with label deal | work=Denver Post | date=March 27, 2008}}</ref> On March 31, the band announced that they would be playing [[Tucson]], [[Arizona|Arizona's]] major alternative rock festival, [[KFMA]] Day, with [[Metallica]], [[Apocalyptica]], [[Chiodos]], and [[Scars on Broadway]] on May 16.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of KFMADAY|url=http://www.kfma.com/page.php?page_id=58|publisher=KFMA, Tucson, AZ, USA|access-date=August 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819065657/http://www.kfma.com/page.php?page_id=58|archive-date=August 19, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Flobots were also part of the sixteenth annual [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] [[KROQ Weenie Roast|Weenie Roast]] on May 17, along with [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Flogging Molly]], [[Metallica]], [[The Offspring]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[The Raconteurs]], [[Rise Against]], [[Scars on Broadway]] and [[Seether]].

{{Quote|text="How can we get people to come together for a cause through song? That influenced the whole methodology of the song-building, period. That's the philosophy of pretty much the last three years of the band. That's the reason why we looked in a very real way at how we bring music back to protest culture. How do we establish and build a culture that communicates emotions, that uses our emotional state as a basis for power? How do we have nonviolent representations of our strength? One of those ways is by having 500 voices be on the same breath. That was the anchor for both our album and our activist work over the last few years. We started from the streets and used the songs in a community environment; then we took them to the studio.|author=Stephen "Brer Rabbit" Brackett<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/music/flobots-new-album-no-enemies-is-activist-hip-hop-8929232|title=Three Albums Later, the Flobots Have Perfected Protest Songwriting|first=Brett|last=Callwood|date=April 10, 2017|access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref> |source= }}
