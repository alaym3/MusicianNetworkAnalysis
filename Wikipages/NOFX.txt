'''NOFX''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|oʊ|ɛ|f|ˈ|ɛ|k|s}}) is an American [[punk rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 1983.<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.nofxofficialwebsite.com/history/history.html |title=History |website=Nofxofficialwebsite.com |access-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref> Vocalist/bassist [[Fat Mike]], guitarist [[Eric Melvin]] and drummer [[Erik Sandin]] are original founding and longest-serving members of the band, who have appeared on every release of the band, although Sandin departed briefly in 1985, only to rejoin the following year.<ref name="History"/> [[El Hefe]] joined the band in 1991 to play lead guitar and [[trumpet]], rounding out the current line-up.

NOFX's [[mainstream]] success coincided with increased interest in punk rock during the 1990s, though, unlike many of their contemporaries (including [[Bad Religion]], [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]]), they have never been signed to a [[major label]]. NOFX has released fourteen studio albums, sixteen extended plays<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p13807/discography/singles-eps|pure_url=yes}} |title=NOFX EPs & Singles |website=Allmusic |access-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref> and a number of seven-inch singles. The band rose to popularity with their fifth studio album ''[[Punk in Drublic]]'' (1994), which is their only release to receive [[Music recording certification|gold certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="riaa">{{cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=NOFX#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|website=Riaa.com|access-date=March 13, 2020}}</ref> Their latest studio album, ''[[Single Album]]'', was released on February 26, 2021.

In 2008, NOFX broadcast their own show on [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse TV]] entitled ''[[NOFX: Backstage Passport]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fuse.tv/tv/nofx-backstage-passport/index.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320151515/http://fuse.tv/tv/nofx-backstage-passport/index.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 20, 2008 |title=NOFX Backstage Passport |website=Fuse.tv |access-date=January 28, 2010 }}</ref>

==History==
===Early years (1983–1987)===
In 1983, guitarist Eric Melvin met bassist/vocalist Mike Burkett (Fat Mike) and started the band under the name NO-FX, after a [[Boston]] hardcore punk band called [[Negative FX]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nofxofficialwebsite.com/history/history.shtml |title=History // NOFX |website=Nofxofficialwebsite.com |access-date=January 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531153148/http://www.nofxofficialwebsite.com/history/history.shtml |archive-date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref> At this time, they were joined by drummer Erik "Smelly" Sandin. NOFX's first recording was a demo <ref>{{cite web |url=http://nofxwiki.net/wiki/index.php?title=Demo_Tape |title=Demo Tape |website=Nofxwiki.net|date=November 5, 2007 |access-date=April 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205180628/http://nofxwiki.net/wiki/index.php?title=Demo_Tape |archive-date=December 5, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> from 1984, entitled ''Thalidomide Child'', produced by [[Germs (band)|Germs]] drummer [[Don Bolles (musician)|Don Bolles]], which did not sell many copies,{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} and [[Fat Mike]] once claimed that no copies existed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} The demo would be re-released in 2012.<ref name=Espyrock>{{cite web|title=First EP Being Re-released|url=http://espyrock.com/news/nofx-to-release-thalidomide-child-ep-their-first-ever-ep-recorded-in-1984|website=Espyrock.com}}</ref><ref name=altpress.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/nofx_detail_massive_box_set_126_inches_of_nofx |website=Altpress.com |title=Press release| date=January 26, 2012}}</ref> The group released its self-titled debut extended play ''[[NOFX (EP)|NOFX]]'' on [[Mystic Records]] in 1985; it was later re-released in 1992 as part of the ''[[Maximum Rocknroll (album)|Maximum Rocknroll]]'' CD.
[[file:NOFX @ Arena Joondalup (12 12 2010) (5272638037).jpg|thumb|Founding member [[Fat Mike]]]]
The band's line-up had undergone a number of changes; however, the original three members had reunited. For a year, Erik "Smelly" Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, and later by Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident.<ref>{{cite web|last=Slonaker|first=Robert|title=NOFX Band Biography and Discography|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/nofx-band-biography-discography-2585169.html?cat=33|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130210034628/http://voices.yahoo.com/nofx-band-biography-discography-2585169.html?cat=33|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 10, 2013|publisher=Yahoo Voices|access-date=July 28, 2012}}</ref> In 1986, the band released the extended play ''[[So What If We're on Mystic!]]''. Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the extended play ''[[The P.M.R.C. Can Suck on This]]'', attacking the [[Parents Music Resource Center|PMRC]]'s campaign for music censorship. The original cover was an edited [[Sadism and masochism|S&M]] photo; the cover for the re-released version was changed to a photo of [[Eric Melvin]]. Prior to the release of ''Liberal Animation'', a compilation of 14 early NOFX songs was released on [[Mystic Records]]. The album was self-titled, and featured the songs from the ''NOFX'' and ''[[So What If We're on Mystic!]]'' extended plays and only around 1,000 copies were pressed. The album's cover was a redesigned version of the cover from the ''NOFX'' extended play.

===First four albums and signing to Epitaph (1988–1993)===
NOFX recorded their debut studio album ''[[Liberal Animation]]'' in 1988 with [[Brett Gurewitz]] of [[Bad Religion]]. Although the title and some of the album's lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after writing the ''Liberal Animation'' album.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.nofx.org/oldint/flipside97.html |title=Flipside 1997 July/August |website=Nofx.org |access-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref> The album was re-released in 1991 on Gurewitz's label [[Epitaph Records]]. Casillas left the band shortly after the recording of ''Liberal Animation'' and was replaced by Steve Kidwiller (a.k.a. "Steve the Caucasian"). The band released its second studio album, ''[[S&M Airlines]]'', through Epitaph in 1989.

In 1991, NOFX released its third studio album, ''[[Ribbed]]''. Shortly after the album was released, Steve Kidwiller left the band, and [[El Hefe|Aaron Abeyta]] (a.k.a. "El Hefe") joined the group. With Abeyta, the band recorded the extended play ''[[The Longest Line]]'', followed by the studio album ''[[White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean]]'', released in May and November 1992 respectively. Also in 1992, NOFX's former label [[Mystic Records]] released ''[[Maximum Rocknroll (album)|Maximum Rocknroll]]'', which compiles early singles and demo songs and is a reissue of their 1989 long-out-of-print compilation tape ''E Is for Everything''. Despite being referred to as an "official" release, [[Fat Mike]] has been quoted as saying that he did not know that the album existed until he saw a copy of it "in a store."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nofx.org/albums/mrr/mrr.html |title=So What If We're On Mystic! – Albums – NOFX |website=Nofxofficialwebsite.com |access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref>

===Rise to popularity (1994–1999)===
[[file:NOFX @ Arena Joondalup (12 12 2010) (5272637863).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Founding member [[Eric Melvin]]]]
In the wake of the 1990s [[Punk rock#Pop-punk and mainstream success|punk rock revival]] revolution (dominated by [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]], [[Bad Religion]] and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]), NOFX released their fifth studio album ''[[Punk in Drublic]]'' in July 1994. It is one of the band's most successful albums, peaking at number 12 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nofx/chart-history/TLN|title=NOFX - Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=March 13, 2020}}</ref> and obtaining [[Music recording sales certification|gold status]] six years after its release.<ref name="riaa" /> Although one of the album's singles "Leave It Alone" got airplay on [[active rock]] radio stations, the most notable being [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]],<ref>#95 on the [[KROQ Top 106.7 Countdown of 1995]]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radiohitlist.com/KROQ/KROQ-1995.htm|title=KROQ Top 106.7 Songs of 1995 Countdown List|website=Radiohitlist.com|access-date=March 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923043605/http://www.radiohitlist.com/KROQ/KROQ-1995.htm|archive-date=September 23, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> its music video never received airplay on MTV. Fat Mike has been quoted saying, "We made the 'Leave It Alone' video, and we decided not to send it to MTV. We just didn't want to be a part of that machine, of that 'punk wave.'"<ref name=exclaim.ca>{{cite web|title=Fat Mike turning down MTV|url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/nofx-punk_off_their_asses/Page/3|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140806203410/http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/nofx-punk_off_their_asses/Page/3|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 6, 2014|website=Exclaim.ca|access-date=August 2, 2014}}</ref>

Due to the success of ''Punk in Drublic'', NOFX received many offers to sign with major record labels, but the band declined the offers. In 1995, the band released its first live album, ''[[I Heard They Suck Live!!]]''. In the liner notes the band explicitly rejected the advances of major record labels and radio airplay, stating "We've been doing fine all these years without you so leave us alone!" ''Punk in Drublic'' is now considered a classic punk album by fans and critics alike.

''Punk in Drublic'' was followed by 1996's ''[[Heavy Petting Zoo]]'', whose LP companion featured different cover art and the name ''Eating Lamb''. The artwork for the CD featured a man holding a sheep, while the LP depicted the same man in a [[69 (sex position)|69]] position with the sheep. The ''Eating Lamb'' version was banned from sale in Germany due to its obscene cover art. The LP version did not achieve the success of its predecessor, although it was the first NOFX record to achieve a position on the ''Billboard'' charts, reaching number 63. Fat Mike stated: "Weird record. I thought it was the coolest record when we finished it, but a few months later I wasn't so sure. Some of those songs are kinda weird. I like the cover a lot though. I think it sold well in Belgium."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/149/Heavy_Petting_Zoo |title=Epitaph Records: NOFX – Heavy Petting Zoo |website=Epitaph.com |access-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref>

In 1997, the band released ''[[So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes]]'', a return to faster punk, as exemplified by the frenetic opening track, "It's My Job to Keep Punk Rock Elite."

NOFX released ''[[The Decline (EP)|The Decline]]'', an 18-minute single-track extended play, which served as a fiery and cynical social commentary, in 1999. ''The Decline'', clocking in at 18:23, is the second-longest punk song ever recorded (behind [[Crass]]' 20-minute song "[[Yes Sir, I Will|Taking Sides]]").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid2=9&fid1=1004&csid1=79 |title=Exclaim!

===Move from Epitaph to Fat Wreck Chords (2000–2008)===
NOFX released its eighth studio album, ''[[Pump Up the Valuum]]'', in 2000. It was the band's final album released through Epitaph, as the band decided to sign to Fat Mike's own label, [[Fat Wreck Chords]].

In 2002, the band recorded ''[[BYO Split Series Volume III]]'', a split album with [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], in which Rancid covered NOFX songs and NOFX covered Rancid songs.

[[file:NOFX5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|NOFX on [[Warped Tour]] '06]]
NOFX released its ninth studio album, ''[[The War on Errorism]]'', in 2003, an album of political songs. It became the start of its anti-[[George W. Bush]] campaign. Fat Mike organized the website punkvoter.com, compiled two chart-topping ''[[Rock Against Bush]]'' albums, and started a [[Rock Against Bush]] U.S. tour. The song "Separation of Church and Skate" from the album was featured in the game ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/the-sounds-of-tony-hawks-underground-6077293 |title=The Sounds of Tony Hawk's Underground - GameSpot.com |website=Au.gamespot.com |date=October 24, 2003 |access-date=July 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003044502/http://au.gamespot.com/news/the-sounds-of-tony-hawks-underground-6077293 |archive-date=October 3, 2013 }}</ref> In 2004, a previously unreleased demo version of their song "Concerns of a GOP Neo-Phyte" was contributed to the compilation album ''Take Action! Vol. 4''.

In February 2005, the band launched the NOFX [[7" of the Month Club]], a subscription-based service, which saw the release of one new extended play almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these extended plays was chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3,000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. [[Fat Wreck Chords]] later released full sets of the extended plays.

[[File:NOFX2.jpg|left|thumb|NOFX performing at ''"The Wall"'' in [[Taipei]], Taiwan]]

On March 14, 2006, the extended play ''[[Never Trust a Hippy]]'' was released. The EP was followed on April 18 by the studio album ''[[Wolves in Wolves' Clothing]]''. On September 12, 2006, the video game ''[[EA Sports]]'' ''[[NHL 07]]'' was released, featuring "Wolves in Wolves' Clothing" on its soundtrack, produced by Bill Stevenson and Fat Mike. NOFX's song "Kill All the White Man" was played briefly in the action movie ''Crank'' in 2006, and was credited as such in the film's soundtrack.

In January 2007, the band recorded three nights of performances in San Francisco, California, for their second live album, ''[[They've Actually Gotten Worse Live!]]'', released November 20, 2007. The live album is described on the press release as "their sloppiest, drunkest, funniest, best sounding recording ever ... and they even made sure not to play any songs off their 1995 live album ''[[I Heard They Suck Live]]''."<ref name="autogenerated1" />

NOFX launched a world tour in September 2007, which included concerts in [[Israel]] ([[Jerusalem]], [[Tel Aviv]], and [[Haifa]]). During its final performances in Israel (September 7 in Haifa), vocalist Fat Mike inadvertently struck guitarist Eric Melvin with his bass guitar during the performance of "Bottles to the Ground", breaking the guitar's neck, and leaving a bloody gash on Melvin's forehead. The broken bass guitar was replaced with one from [[Useless ID]] for the rest of the concert. The band completed its scheduled set amidst the audience's cheers for Melvin's good humor and perseverance. This tour was the basis of the band's television show, ''[[NOFX: Backstage Passport]]''. The show was originally to be titled ''NOFX: Punk Rock Passport'', but the band had issues with the company who held the rights to air the show, Fuse TV. Along with the show's title being changed, the band had numerous other issues with Fuse, including the company attempting to fabricate story lines that were untrue. Fat Mike, in an interview with Studio Q on the CBC, stated that the three months editing the show were the worst three months of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/schedule-for-tuesday-august-25-2015-1.3202764/fat-mike-on-25-years-of-fat-wreck-chords-1.3202797 |title=Fat Mike on 25 years of Fat Wreck Chords |website=Cbc.ca |access-date=August 25, 2015 }}</ref>

During the same tour, NOFX played four concerts in [[South Africa]], the band's first performances on the African continent. The tour of South Africa followed successful tours by the bands [[Lagwagon]], [[Frenzal Rhomb]], and [[Mad Caddies]], all of which are signed to [[Fat Wreck Chords]].

[[file:Eric Sandin.jpg|thumb|upright|Founding member [[Erik Sandin]]]]
In February 2009, NOFX reunited with former members Steve Kidwiller and Dave Casillas for its 25th anniversary special performances. NOFX released a new album, ''[[Coaster (album)|Coaster]]'',<ref name="fatwreck">{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/record/detail/737 |title=NOFX :: Coaster – Records: Fat Wreck Chords |website=Fatwreck.com |access-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref> on April 28, 2009.<ref name="fatwreck" /><ref>{{cite web|author=dubs |url=http://submergemag.com/featured/one-more-time-with-feeling/219/ |title=One More Time With Feeling &#124; SubMerge Magazine |website=Submergemag.com |date=August 5, 2008 |access-date=May 29, 2010}}</ref> The band worked with the same co-producer, [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]], who produced its previous album, ''[[Wolves in Wolves' Clothing]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/31354 |title=Bill Stevenson working on new NOFX record |website=Punknews.org |access-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref> NOFX was also added to the lineup for the [[Warped Tour 2009]].<ref>{{cite web |date=June 17, 2009 |url=http://www.truepunk.com/interviews/interview-with-fat-mike-of-nofx/ |title=Warped Tour 2009 – May 2009 Interview |website=Truepunk.com |access-date=January 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717023317/http://www.truepunk.com/interviews/interview-with-fat-mike-of-nofx/ |archive-date=July 17, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=134&csid2=988&fid1=39812 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630124942/http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=134&csid2=988&fid1=39812 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |title=Warped Tour 2009 – Video Interview |website=Exclaim.ca |date=November 7, 2009 |access-date=January 28, 2010 }}</ref> They also toured [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] in late 2009 with [[Bad Religion]].

NOFX released a new extended play on November 24, 2009, titled ''[[Cokie the Clown]]''. It was released on one CD or two seven-inch vinyl records, which are called ''Cokie the Clown'' and ''My Orphan Year''. The extended play consists of outtakes from the ''Coaster'' sessions. NOFX started its spring 2010 "Fermented and Flailing" tour on April 21. This was the official tour for its album ''Coaster''.

During this time period, Fat Mike would occasionally adopt the Cokie the Clown persona (as seen on the extended play's cover and the "Cokie the Clown" music video<ref>{{cite web| last = Toleson| first = Amy| title = NOFX post 'Cokie the Clown' video| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = November 16, 2009| url = http://altpress.com/news/nofxcokievid.htm| access-date = March 24, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120516070109/http://www.altpress.com/news/nofxcokievid.htm| archive-date = May 16, 2012| url-status = dead}}</ref>) during live performances.

In a January 2011 interview with The Daily Times, [[Fat Mike]] revealed that a new NOFX album was in production, saying "There are some really good songs on ''Coaster'', but after having written 300 songs, I feel lucky I came up with them. That's why there are songs on there about [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Tegan and Sara]]. I'm reaching, man. Sometimes I grab stuff just to grab stuff, and I'm going in a lot of different directions."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailytimes.com/Weekend/story/NOFX_still_living_the_punk_rock_life_after_all_these_years_id_007223 |title=The Daily Times – NOFX still living the punk rock life after all these years |website=Thedailytimes.com |access-date=October 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104235917/http://www.thedailytimes.com/Weekend/story/NOFX_still_living_the_punk_rock_life_after_all_these_years_id_007223 |archive-date=January 4, 2013 }}</ref> In December 2011, Fat Mike revealed to [[Phoenix New Times]] that he has begun work on a new NOFX album and a soundtrack to a "fetish film" called ''Rubber Bordello''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2011/12/nofxs_fat_mike_on_cokie_the_cl.php?page=2 |title=NOFX's Fat Mike on Cokie the Clown, Drinking, and Occupy Wall Street |website=[[Phoenix New Times|blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com]] |date=December 26, 2011 |access-date=January 2, 2012}}</ref>

In June 2011, NOFX began their Great White North Tour, which would have them traveling across Canada. The tour kicked off in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]], on June 14. It was the first time the band had been to Newfoundland.

Along with a self-titled 10" of 80s hardcore punk cover songs, the band also planned to re-release their first recordings in summer 2011. The 10" features covers from the Necros and D.O.A., and songs such as "Police Brutality" and "Race Riot." The album was released on a vinyl record and has been distributed to independent record companies around the U.S., Great Britain, and elsewhere.

I've got 12 songs, but I don't have a name for it and only a few of the songs are finished," he says.

==Music style and influences==
The band's sound is diverse, utilizing elements of [[punk rock]], [[skate punk]], [[melodic hardcore]], [[ska punk]], and other music genres. Some of their songs focus on, or reference, topics such as [[left-wing politics]] and [[anarchy]], [[society]], [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]], [[sexism]], [[sexuality]], [[misogyny]], [[homophobia]] and [[homosexuality]], [[Social inequality|class inequalities]], the use of [[Drug user|drugs]] and [[Alcohol abuse|alcohol]], the [[mass media|media]] and [[popular culture]], [[religion]] and [[schadenfreude]], often represented in a humorous manner.<ref>{{Citation|title=NOFX – There's No Fun In Fundamentalism|url=https://genius.com/Nofx-theres-no-fun-in-fundamentalism-lyrics|language=en|access-date=October 21, 2020}}</ref> The band has released songs that range in length from under a minute, with songs such as "I Gotta Pee" (0:32) and "Murder the Government" (0:45), to its longest song, "The Decline", which is 18 minutes 22 seconds long.

NOFX also frequently poke fun (in a lighthearted manner) at other bands and figures in the punk rock community. Such examples include "Whoa on the Whoas", parodying [[The Offspring]]'s frequent use of the word "whoa" in their songs, and mocking [[Blink-182]] in their song "Fun Things to Fuck (If You're a Winner)". The band is also known for referencing or paying tribute to [[Bad Religion]] in both their songs and their albums, with examples including "I Am a Huge Fan of Bad Religion"; mentioning their records on "We Got Two Jealous Agains" and its sequel "I've Got One Jealous Again, Again"; and the cover of ''[[Surfer (EP)|Surfer]]'' parodying that of Bad Religion's 1988 album ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]''. A split album between NOFX and fellow punk band Rancid featured each group covering 6 songs from the other band's catalog.

The band cites its influences as [[Bad Religion]], [[Rich Kids on LSD]], [[D.I. (band)|D.I.]], [[SNFU]], [[Operation Ivy (band)|Operation Ivy]], [[The Dickies]], [[Descendents (band)|Descendents]], [[Circle Jerks]], [[Dead Milkmen]], [[Ramones]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[Adrenalin O.D.]], [[Minor Threat]], [[The Germs|Germs]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Adolescents (band)|The Adolescents]], [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], and [[Subhumans (UK band)|Subhumans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nofxofficialwebsite.com/qa/qa_read.php3?page=3 |title=Q & A &#124; Read fuck Answers &#124; NOFX |website=Nofxofficialwebsite.com |access-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://metalriot.com/news/mr-exclusive-interview-louiche-mayorga-of-suicidal-tendencies-and-luicidal/ |title=MR Exclusive Interview: Louiche Mayorga of Suicidal Tendencies and Luicidal |work=Metal Riot |date=April 5, 2013 |access-date=October 8, 2018 |archive-date=June 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616153552/http://metalriot.com/news/mr-exclusive-interview-louiche-mayorga-of-suicidal-tendencies-and-luicidal/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-suicidal-tendencies-bassist-louiche-mayorga-sues-for-unpaid-royalties/|title=Former SUICIDAL TENDENCIES Bassist LOUICHE MAYORGA Sues For Unpaid Royalties |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=December 9, 2016 |access-date=October 8, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6251730/nofx-fat-mike-backstage-passport-2-interview|title=NOFX's Fat Mike Talks Punk, Drugs & 'Backstage Passport 2'|date=September 17, 2014|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

==Relationship with the media==
For years the band consented to very few interviews and have only made a few music videos, citing the fact that it does not need any more exposure and that people were exploiting the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nofxofficialwebsite.com/qa/qa.html |title=All About Q&A // Q&A // NOFX |website=Nofxofficialwebsite.com |access-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref> In recent years, Fat Mike has consented to more interviews, including six different interviews with [[Nardwuar]] between 2002 and 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nardwuar.com/vs/fat_mike/ |title=Nardwuar vs Fat Mike |website=Nardwuar.com |access-date=October 26, 2011 |archive-date=March 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200311164520/https://nardwuar.com/vs/fat_mike/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band has also refused permission for its music videos to be broadcast on [[MTV]], [[VH1]], and similar music channels, although its music has been played on Canada's [[Much Music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://watch.muchmusic.com/video-playlists/video-playliststhe-punkshow/clip247528#clip247528 |title=NOFX – Cokie The Clown |website=Watch.muchmusic.com |access-date=October 26, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> NOFX made a live appearance on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/articles/story/6416250/wilco_modest_mouse_on_tv |title=Wilco, Modest Mouse on TV: Wilco : Rolling Stone |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=August 9, 2004 |access-date=January 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922181301/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/wilco/articles/story/6416250/wilco_modest_mouse_on_tv |archive-date=September 22, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band briefly pursued an "anti-Conan" riff, although the intent was likely jocular. 

The credits on the album ''[[Heavy Petting Zoo]]'' call out MTV, along with commercial radio stations and major labels, saying "we've been doin' just fine all these years without you so leave us the fuck alone" and calling them "assholes."

Fat Mike has also repeatedly conducted interviews with the Australian alternative radio station [[Triple J]] on its breakfast show with Jay (Jason Whalley) and the Doctor ([[Lindsay McDougall]]). Jay and the Doctor are both members of [[Frenzal Rhomb]], an Australian punk rock band that has played many tours and festivals with NOFX, and that has its music distribution outside Australia handled by Mike's Fat Wreck Chords label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/band/index/15 |title=Bands: Fat Wreck Chords |website=Fatwreck.com |access-date=January 28, 2010}}</ref>
