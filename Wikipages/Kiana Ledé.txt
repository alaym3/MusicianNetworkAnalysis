As a child, Ledé began to regularly perform in school plays and beauty pageants while taking voice lessons and piano study.<ref name="new times">Burnsilver, Glenn (August 9, 2012). "[http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2012-08-09/music/kiana-brown-wants-to-be-a-normal-star/ Kiana Brown Wants to Be a "Normal" Star]" ''[[Phoenix New Times]]''.</ref> She would regularly get kicked out of class for singing, prompting her mother to enroll her in a performing arts school so she could put her talent to good use.<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 6, 2018 |title=Kiana Ledé Sings Ex And Talks About Her Acting Career And Upbringing With Mina SayWhat |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBSuUjqdDHk|website=YouTube}}</ref> She attended [[Mountain Pointe High School]].<ref name="new times" />

==Career==
In 2011, Ledé's mother discovered [[Kidz Bop]], a website for kids to upload and share videos of themselves performing. She uploaded a video of Ledé performing an original number on the piano which was selected as a finalist. After performing [[Adele]]'s "[[Someone like You (Adele song)|Someone Like You]]" to earn her a place in the Top 4, Ledé won the 2011 KIDZ Star USA Grand Prize out of 45,000 submissions, the largest national talent competition for kids ages 15 and under.<ref name="new times" />

At a school assembly, Ledé was told that she won the national talent search by ''[[American Idol]]'' winner [[Kris Allen]]. The prize included a [[RCA Records]] recording contract and a starring role in the ''[[Kidz Bop 21]]'' music video and commercial. Allen said after seeing her live, "she went from 'She's good' to 'She is no doubt gonna win this thing.'"<ref name="az central">Masley, Ed (October 22, 2011). "[https://www.azcentral.com/12news/news/articles/2011/10/21/20111021kiana-brown-wins-kidz-star-usa-talent-search-phoenix-mountain-pointe-high-school.html Phoenix teen Kiana Brown wins 'KIDZ Bop' talent search]" ''[[The Arizona Republic]]''.</ref>

Ledé said she had the opportunity to listen to and select from her top three song choices. After considering and listening to the songs, she said she chose her first single "Hey Chica" because of the upbeat tempo. The song was released June 19, 2012.<ref name="and">Roemhild, Travis (June 10, 2012). "[http://www.ahwatukee.com/news/article_f46b5e2a-b1c3-11e1-8bc0-001a4bcf887a.html MP student works hard to make a name in the music industry]" ''Ahwatukee Foothills News''.</ref> Brown has performed the song on ''[[Today (American TV program)|The Today Show]]'' and at the 86th annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]. She also performed "Do The Mermaid" from ''[[Barbie in A Mermaid Tale 2]]''.

In 2012, Ledé was named cover girl for Miss Moxie's Holiday 2012 issue.<ref name="moxie">Miss Moxie (November 22, 2012). "[http://missmoxieonline.com/moxienews/kiana-brown-announced-as-next-miss-moxie-cover-girl/ Kiana Brown Announced as Next Miss Moxie Cover Girl] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213023050/http://missmoxieonline.com/moxienews/kiana-brown-announced-as-next-miss-moxie-cover-girl/ |date=December 13, 2014}}" ''Miss Moxie''.</ref> The site praised "Hey Chica" for promoting a "clear message of self-empowerment and encourages young women to feel beautiful in their own skin."

At the age of 16, Ledé moved to North Hollywood. She worked at a gymnastics center and a jazz club due to her receiving no advance from RCA Records. As artists do, she wanted more creative control of her music, so she showed the label what she was working on. They did not see potential in her work, and dropped her a month later. She was later motivated by Grammy award-winning production duo Rice N' Peas to perform cover songs. The series was dubbed "Soulfood Sessions" and helped her gain a following.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Zaynab|date=December 17, 2018 |title=Kiana Ledé Reveals How She Bounced Back After Being Dropped From Her Label |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kiana-lede-reveals-how-she-bounced-back-after-being-dropped-from-her-label-news.67013.html |website=HotNewHipHop}}</ref>

In 2016, Ledé was cast in the series regular role as Zoe Vaughn on the second season of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Scream (TV series)|Scream]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mtvs-scream-sets-new-cast-874096 |title=MTV's 'Scream' Sets New Cast, Season 2 Premiere Date|last = Goldberg|first = Lesley|date = March 10, 2016 |work = Hollywood Reporter|access-date = September 20, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, she also accepted a lead role alongside [[Joseph Simmons]] of [[Run-DMC]] in the Netflix original series ''All About The Washingtons''. The series was cancelled after only one season.

Following her departure from RCA Records, Ledé signed with [[Republic Records]]<ref name="BB-Bonfyre-emerging">{{Cite web|last=Zellner |first=Xander |date=March 20, 2019 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8503374/nicole-bus-bonfyre-kiana-lede-emerging-artists-chart |title=R&B Singers Nicole Bus, The Bonfyre & Kiana Ledé Debut on Emerging Artists Chart |website=Billboard |access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name="BB-emerging">{{Cite web|last=Ginsberg |first=Gab |date=March 22, 2019 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8503579/kiana-lede-emerging-artists-spotlight |title=Emerging Artists Spotlight: Kiana Ledé |website=Billboard |access-date=April 26, 2019 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> after her rendition of Drake's "Hotline Bling" helped gain their attention. She would later release her debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''Selfless'' in July 2018.<ref name="BB-emerging" /> The EP includes her breakout single "Ex", which became her first entry to the [[Billboard charts]], peaking at number 9 on the US [[R&B Songs]] charts and at number 1 in several countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8508389/nle-choppa-kiana-lede-luh-kel-chart-success|title=Emerging Hip-Hop: NLE Choppa, Kiana Lede & Luh Kel Make Noise With Latest Chart Moves|website=Billboard |access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> It has earned platinum status from the RIAA as of June 2020. To promote ''Selfess'', she served as opening act with [[Ro James]] on Jessie J's [[List of Jessie J concert tours|R.O.S.E. Tour]].

Ledé's second studio EP, ''Myself'', was released in June 2019, and included the single "Bouncin" featuring rapper [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]], which peaked within the top 30 of ''Billboard'''s rhythmic airplay chart. She would also embark on her first headlining tour that same year.

Stand-alone singles "Title" and "Easy Breezy" would build momentum for her debut album, which Ledé had been working on for some time. Her highly anticipated 17-track debut album, titled ''Kiki'' was released on April 3, 2020, which debuted at number 30 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref name="BB-emerging" /> to positive reviews. The album features guest appearances from R&B stars [[Ari Lennox]], [[6LACK]] and more. The lead single "Mad at Me" interpolates [[Outkast]]'s 2000 hit song "[[So Fresh, So Clean]]".

A tour was planned starting in Europe, but it was eventually postponed to 2021 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. She is currently scheduled to perform across Europe on May 23.

Ledé would later make a few guest appearances on tracks with [[Usher (musician)|Usher]], [[Queen Naija]] and others. She released the deluxe edition of ''Kiki'' on October 23, including seven bonus tracks.
