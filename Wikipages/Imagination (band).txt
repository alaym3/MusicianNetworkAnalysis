They had [[Hit record|hits]] in 28 countries, earning four [[Music recording sales certification|platinum discs]], nine [[Music recording sales certification|gold discs]] and more than a dozen [[Music recording sales certification|silver discs]] around the world between 1981 and 1983.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Pete |last= Lewis |title= Imagination: Flash Forward |magazine= [[Blues & Soul]] |issue= 1094 |date= 8 November 2019 |access-date= 9 May 2020 |url= http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/875/imagination_flash_forward/}}</ref>

==History==
===Background===
Singer/keyboardist [[Leee John]] (born 23 June 1957, [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney, London]]) was working as a backing vocalist for [[the Delfonics]], [[Chairmen of the Board]], [[the Velvelettes]] and [[the Elgins]]<ref name="AM">{{cite web|first= Andy |last= Kellman |title= Imagination – Artist Biography |publisher= [[AllMusic]]. [[All Media Network]] |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/imagination-mn0000078255/biography |access-date= 3 March 2009}}</ref> when he met Ashley Ingram, a guitarist/bassist (born 27 November 1960, [[Northampton]]). John and Ingram formed a songwriting partnership, resolving to start their own "slinky, sexy and erotic" group, working in a short-lived band called ''Fizzz''. While they were auditioning for another short-lived band, ''Midnight Express'', they met drummer [[Errol Kennedy]] (born 9 June 1953, [[Montego Bay]], [[Jamaica]]), who at a very young age had learned to drum in the [[Boys' Brigade]] and [[Air Training Corps]]. Kennedy was a member of the London-based soul-funk band ''TFB'' (''Typical Funk Band''), later known as [[Central Line (band)|Central Line]], prior to co-founding Midnight Express.

===Career===
Formed in early 1981,<ref name="AM"/> the trio took a demo tape of a track called "[[Body Talk (Imagination song)|Body Talk]]" to producers [[Jolley & Swain]]. It was released as a single in April 1981 under the group name Imagination, which the group chose as a tribute to [[John Lennon]]. The track reached number 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in July 1981, selling 250,000 copies in the UK and spending 18 weeks in the Top 50. They had two more [[hit single]]s that year, "In and Out of Love" (September 1981) and "Flashback" (November 1981), both of which peaked at number 16, all from their debut album, also called ''[[Body Talk (Imagination album)|Body Talk]]''.

Their biggest hit, "[[Just an Illusion]]", peaked at number two in March 1982 ("Just an Illusion" would later be used as the end title song to the 1986 film, ''[[F/X]]''), followed by "Music and Lights" (number five in June), "In the Heat of the Night" (number 22 in September, also the name of their second album), and "[[Changes (Imagination song)|Changes]]" (number 31 in December).<ref name="UK">{{cite book|first= David |last= Roberts |year= 2006 |title= British Hit Singles & Albums |edition= 19th |publisher= [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Records Limited]] |location= London |page= 267 |isbn= 1-904994-10-5}}</ref> This was accompanied by a sell-out [[concert tour]] of Europe, with 22 dates in the UK. The trio frequently appeared on [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and other pop music television programmes, with a distinctive [[Exotic dancer|exotic]] style, reminiscent of [[Roman Senate|Roman senators]], [[harem]] orderlies and [[Slavery|slaves]]. John made a guest appearance on ''[[Doctor Who]]'' in 1983. They were also known for their esoteric album [[Liner notes|sleeve notes]].

Following this, the success of the group in the UK waned, but they continued to perform, tour and record.<ref name="AM"/> In 1987, they were signed to [[RCA Records]], but by the end of that year Ingram and Kennedy left the band. John with new members, Nat Augustin and Peter Royer, continued and recorded a last album, ''Fascination of the Physical'', in 1992. The band split in 1992.

John went back to acting, but re-surfaced as a singer in the reality television show ''[[Reborn in the USA]]''. Ingram also enjoyed success as a songwriter for [[Des'ree]].
