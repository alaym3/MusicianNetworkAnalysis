==Controversies==
===Shocktoberfest controversy===
In 2018, prior to the [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine's]] Shocktoberfest music event, the university's Student Services was criticized for allowing Gore to perform at the event after a security video from two years prior emerged showing Gore chasing his girlfriend down a hallway and then hitting her several times.<ref>{{cite news | last = Antonios | first = Caitlin | date = October 19, 2018 | title = Famous Dex Appears as Shocktoberfest Midliner Despite Abuse Video | url = https://www.newuniversity.org/2018/10/19/famous-dex-appears-as-shocktoberfest-midliner-despite-abuse-video/ | work = New University}}</ref>  Gore was permitted to perform despite the domestic abuse revelations, and while doing so jumped into the crowded audience causing safety barriers to be knocked over by a rush of audience members.  The event was shut down as a result. While leaving the event, it was alleged someone in Gore's vehicle pointed a gun at students.  According to the university's official campus newspaper, "Gore bragged online about shutting down the event saying, 'I just shut the show down. And it was all positive vibes.'"<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Alvarez | first1 = Ashley | last2 = Duong | first2 = Ashley | date = October 20, 2018 | title = Shocktoberfest Cancelled After Famous Dex Jumps Into Crowd | url = https://www.newuniversity.org/2018/10/20/shocktoberfest-cancelled-after-famous-dex-jumps-into-crowd/ | work = New University}}</ref>

=== Social network ===
On December 22, 2018, Gore uploaded a video post to his [[Instagram]] page in which he made racially charged jokes at the expense of an elderly [[Indian American]] [[Hindu]] cashier at a gas station he was frequenting with a friend.<ref>[https://blackroommedia.com/?p=3411 Famous Dex Says Disgusting Racial Slur To Indian Store Clerk] - BlackRoomMedia Reporting</ref> During the video, he remarks "Witcho' lil", referring to the man's [[tilaka]] on his forehead. He then adds "That's a mark of [[Buddha]] in between yo' face?", laughing along with his friend.<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/BrvnX7TAeSq/?hl=en Famous Dex Offended Hindus By Joking On A Indian Cashier] - DJ Akadmiks Reporting</ref>

===Substance usage===
Dex has struggled with substance abuse throughout his career. Following release of a video showing him in an extremely inebriated sexual position  fans expressed concern. Shortly after he checked into a rehabilitation facility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thesource.com/2020/12/21/famous-dex-checks-into-drug-rehab-after-disturbing-images-go-viral/|title = Famous Dex Checks into Drug Rehab After Disturbing Images Go Viral|date = December 21, 2020}}</ref>

===Arrest===

He was subsequently sentenced to 364 days in a Los Angeles, California, jail on September 1, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/famous-dex-sentenced-to-1-year-in-prison-report-news.138958.html|title=Famous Dex Sentenced to 1 Year in Prison: Report|date=September 10, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.64461/title.famous-dex-to-serve-jail-time-following-string-of-domestic-violence-arrests|title = Famous Dex to Serve Jail Time Following String of Domestic Violence Arrests|date = September 10, 2021}}</ref>
