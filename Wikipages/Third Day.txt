'''Third Day''' was a [[Christian rock]] band formed in [[Marietta, Georgia]] during the 1990s. The band was founded by lead singer [[Mac Powell]], guitarist [[Mark David Lee|Mark Lee]] (both of whom were the only constant members) and Billy Wilkins.<ref name="Third Day">{{cite web|author=Third Day|url=http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/92.htm|title=Third Day Timeline (1992)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320213824/http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/92.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Drummer David Carr was the last band member to quit, prior to the band’s farewell tour in May and June 2018.

== History ==
=== Forming years and independent recordings (1991–1994) ===
In 1991, high-schoolers Mac Powell and Mark Lee formed Third Day as a Christian music group with pianist Billy Wilkins and guitarist August McCoy. McCoy left the following year to pursue tertiary education. At a 1992 event at Lee's Church, Third Day performed alongside a band called the Bullard Family Singers, which featured David Carr and Tai Anderson. Third Day invited Carr and Anderson to join them shortly after.<ref name="Third Day"/>

In 1993, the band started playing more frequently in the [[Atlanta]] region in order to save money to record an album. Wilkins left the group in order to pursue his teaching career.<ref>{{cite web|author=Third Day|url=http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/93.htm|title=Third Day Timeline (1993)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320213805/http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/93.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Third Day recorded at Furies Studios in Atlanta and with the production help of Carr, ''Long Time Forgotten'' was released in 1994, producing and selling 2,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|author=Third Day|url=http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/94.htm|title=Third Day Timeline (1994)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320213827/http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/94.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1995, the band started looking for a second guitarist. Upon hearing Brad Avery play with singer Chris Carder, Avery was asked to audition. After playing ''Consuming Fire'' during the first rehearsal, Avery was officially asked to join the band.

The band's second album, ''Contagious'', was self-financed for $3,000 and recorded at Furies Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. 1,000 CDs and cassette copies of the demo were released. While playing in Marietta, at the Strand Theatre, the owners offered the band a contract to sign with new independent record label Gray Dot Records. The band released the album ''[[Third Day (Independent album)|Third Day]]'', which sold 20,000 copies. Shortly after, [[Reunion Records]] bought out their Gray Dot contract and signed the band to a multi-album deal.<ref>{{cite web|author=Third Day|url=http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/95.htm|title=Third Day Timeline (1995)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320212739/http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/95.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Recording contract with Reunion Records (1995–1997) ===
Reunion Records released the now official version of ''Third Day'', which has sold over 300,000 copies and was well received by critics. The album also yielded their only mainstream rock radio hit in the U.S., "Nothing at All", which peaked at No.&nbsp;34 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] rock charts.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p182586/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} Billboard]{{cite web|author=Third Day|url=http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/97.htm|title=Third Day Timeline (1997)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320212812/http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/97.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Later in 1995, Christian music headliner [[Newsboys]] asked Third Day to open for them at five West Coast shows. The band also launched their own 65-city tour with [[All Star United]] and [[Seven Day Jesus]] opening for them.

In 1996, the band was nominated for a [[Dove Award]] in the category of ''New Artist of the Year'' and their video for ''Consuming Fire'' directed by [[Chris Metzler]] and [[Jeff Springer]] won a [[Billboard Music Award]] in the category of ''Best Christian Video''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Third Day|url=http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/96.htm|title=Third Day Timeline (1996)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320212750/http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/96.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The video was shot on location in [[Bombay Beach, California]] and other places around the Salton Sea.  This experience and discovering [[Leonard Knight]]'s [[Salvation Mountain]] nearby later inspired the album artwork for the band's album ''Revelation''.

In 1997, the band started working on their second album, ''[[Conspiracy No. 5]]''. The album was produced by [[Sam Taylor (producer)|Sam Taylor]], who had previously worked with [[King's X]] and other Christian bands. The album was nominated for a [[Grammy]] and won Dove Awards for Rock Album of the Year and Rock Song of the Year ("Alien").<ref>{{cite web|author=Third Day|url=http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/97.htm|title=Third Day Timeline (1997)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320212812/http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/97.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The following year, the band toured around the United States, both alone and again opening for Newsboys. Also in 1998, the band recorded a cover of [[Michael W. Smith]]'s "Agnus Dei" for his Dove Award-winning compilation project ''[[Exodus (compilation album)|Exodus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gospel Music Museum|url=http://www.gospelmusicmuseum.org/#!__rising-legends/third-day|title=Rising Legends/Third Day|access-date=February 25, 2016}}</ref>

=== Mainstream and international success (1998–2006) ===
In 1998, the band started working on ''[[Time (Third Day album)|Time]]'' under the production of Monroe Jones. ''Time'' was nominated for a Grammy Award and won another Dove Award for the band.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Some of the songs that were recorded for possible inclusion in the album, but left out during production, are on the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Southern Tracks]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Third Day |url=http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/99.htm |title=Third Day Timeline (1999) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320212805/http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/99.htm |archive-date=March 20, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref> During the band's live shows, they included a significant worship portion, prompting the band to release an album made up exclusively of worship songs. The subsequent album ''[[Offerings: A Worship Album]]'' took about a week to record. In 2000, to support both ''Time'' and ''Offerings'', Third Day went on tour alongside [[Jennifer Knapp]]. Later the same year, the band collaborated on the project ''[[City on a Hill: Songs of Worship and Praise]]'' with [[FFH (band)|FFH]], [[Caedmon's Call]], Peter Furler of [[Newsboys]], [[Jars of Clay]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|author=Third Day|url=http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/00.htm|title=Third Day Timeline (2000)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320213810/http://www.thirdday.com/timeline/00.htm|archive-date=March 20, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2001, the band played in Australia and New Zealand on the heels of the success of the ''Offerings'' album. While touring in the US, Third Day recorded a concert attended by 15,000 fans at the [[HiFi Buys Amphitheatre]] in [[Atlanta]] to be released as their first DVD, ''The Offerings Experience''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} That same year, the band won five Dove Awards as well as their first Grammy.
