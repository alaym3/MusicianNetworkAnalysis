==Background==

The band was established under the name of Rend Collective Experiment between 2002-2003 at Bangor Elim Church, during a point which drummer Gareth Gilkeson described as "a bunch of us trying to figure out life."<ref name=CROSS/><ref name=CCM>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/magazine/2010/oct/38.htm|title=Unrestricted: Finding Community in Organic Worship|last=Hoernschemeyer|first=Emily|date=1 October 2010|magazine=[[CCM Magazine]]|access-date=8 May 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212154856/http://www.ccmmagazine.com/magazine/2010/oct/38.htm|archive-date=12 December 2013}}</ref> While the group comprises over 15 members, the band tours and records with 6 members.<ref name=CROSS/><ref name=CCM/> The remaining members are there for support and to encourage the band "spiritually, musically, and missionally."<ref name=CROSS/><ref name=CCM/> They explained noticing a sense of hostility from the modern culture towards the church and Christians therefore sought to create music that would draw such individuals spiritually and encourage them to come back to church.<ref name=CROSS/><ref name=CCM/>

Rend Collective was on the ''[[And If Our God Is for Us...]]'' Tour with [[Chris Tomlin]] and [[Christy Nockels]] in the Spring of 2011.<ref name=CMSPIN/> They toured with [[Kari Jobe]] on the Majestic Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premierproductions.com/blog/kari-jobe-reveals-majestic-tour|title=Kari Jobe Reveals Majestic Tour!}}</ref>
