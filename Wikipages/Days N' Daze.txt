'''Days N' Daze''' is an American band formed in [[Houston]], Texas performing a type of [[folk punk]] they have called 'H-Town Thrashgrass'. Promoting a strong [[DIY ethic]], Days N' Daze independently records, produces, and promotes all their own music. Song themes range from [[anarchism]] and [[environmental issue]]s to [[anxiety]], [[alcoholism]], and parties.
They are known for their energetic live shows. Days N' Daze have toured extensively in the US, Canada and Europe, playing anything from [[House concert|house shows]] to [[Music festival|festivals]], playing alongside the likes of [[Leftöver Crack]]<ref name=ReverbNation>{{cite web|title=Days N Daze / Bio - ReverbNation|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/artist_699584/bio|publisher=ReverbNation|accessdate=3 April 2015|quote=Days N Daze has opened for several national acts, including Leftover Crack, The Infamous Stringdusters, M.D.C., Morning Glory, New Zealand's Night Gaunts, Cancerslug and Black Flag founder Chuck Dukowski's Sextet.}}</ref> and [[Weezer]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Days N Daze - All We've Got Records|url=http://allwevegot.com/artists/days-n-daze/|website=allwevegot.com|publisher=All We've Got Records|accessdate=3 April 2015}}</ref>

==History==
Days N' Daze was founded in 2008 by Whitney Flynn and Jesse Sendejas who both grew up in [[Rosenberg, Texas]],<ref name="McDevlin">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApH3lxuzgVk |title= Cast From The Sewer #51 - Whitney Flynn (Days N Daze)|author=McDevlin|date=23 October 2017|work=|accessdate=2018-04-14}}</ref> one of Houston's suburbs. They knew each other since high school and had been sweethearts before the founding of the band.<ref name="Noisey">{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/ez8kq4/closures-overrated-the-crust-punk-love-songs-of-days-n-daze |title= Closure’s Overrated: The Crust Punk Love Songs of Days N’ Daze|author=Barry Thompson|date=22 March 2017|work=|accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref> 
In the beginning they were the band's only members: Whitney Flynn, with a musical background of classical piano lessons at a young age, followed by years as a trumpeter in her junior and high school's [[marching band]]. And Jesse Sendejas, a self-taught guitar player, who was introduced to music at an early age by his father, a [[Houston Press]] music writer. In the beginning, Flynn and Sendejas didn't have enough funds to buy musical equipment to start a proper punk band, so they started playing all acoustic.<ref>{{cite web |last1=XVX |first1=Mittens |title=Days N’ Daze: Punk is a Movement and a State of Mind |url=https://diyconspiracy.net/days-n-daze-interview/ |website=DIY Conspiracy |access-date=16 June 2021}}</ref> Yet in the band's early days the now characteristic trumpet sound was still absent, as Sendejas felt it wouldn't fit the musical style they were playing. However, he changed his mind after about two years of Flynn's persuasive efforts to give it a try.<ref name="McDevlin" />

Flynn graduated a year early from high school and enrolled at [[Texas State University]] in [[San Marcos (Texas)|San Marcos]]. Sendejas, still attending high school, soon afterwards abandoned education altogether and joined Flynn in San Marcos, a college town both started to loathe early on.<ref name="Noisey" /> In the following years, still being a couple, they started touring extensively and recorded their first four albums. These recordings took place in a closet in the house of Sendejas' father in [[Richmond, Texas]], the same place the band is still recording their albums today.<ref name="Noisey" /> It was during this time that the band grew by two more members: Marissa Sendejas, Jesse's sister<ref name="HP2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/days-n-daze-the-most-charming-riot-of-all-time-6511420 |title= Days N' Daze: The Most Charming Riot of All Time|author=Shea Serrano|date=6 April 2012|work=|accessdate=2018-04-14}}</ref> playing washboard, and Freddie Boatright, playing the [[gutbucket]]. According to Sendejas this initial choice of instruments was purely a matter of cost. He and Flynn wanted to play [[Punk rock|punk]] music from the start but did not have the funds to buy expensive equipment like drums.<ref name="Troll2">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTakUWe-2H8 |title= Days N Daze : Noise Complaint w/Troll 2 (Interview mit Sendejas / Flynn)|author=Troll2|date=6 October 2017|work=|accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref>

Eventually Flynn dropped out of university without a degree, a decision that has been attributed by some to the immense touring schedule of DnD at the time.<ref name="Noisey" /> However, according to Flynn herself, it was a series of circumstances that led her to leave university education. Among those were the death of her grandfather and the nearly contemporaneous separation from Sendejas as her partner. In the course of these events she left the university city of San Marcos in 2012 to live for a couple of months without a fixed address.<ref name="McDevlin" /> Today Flynn manages Days N' Daze pretty much on her own and not only takes care of their finances but also handles tour booking.<ref name="Troll2" /> As Days N' Daze's popularity has grown over the last couple of years and management has become more challenging, Flynn mentioned ideas to continue her education in the area of "music business".<ref name="McDevlin" />

Instead of quitting the band after their breakup, Sendejas and Flynn channelled this emotional turmoil into writing and recording their sixth album ''[[Rogue Taxidermy (album)|Rogue Taxidermy]]''. As of today (08/2018) ''Rogue Taxidermy'' is their most regarded and top selling album on [[Bandcamp]]. The video of the album's song ''Misanthropic Drunken Loner'' has gathered over 6.5 million views on YouTube. The album was released the same year as ''[[:en:Gutter punk|Oogle]] Deathmachine''. In March 2017 they released ''Crustfall'', which features amongst others [[Leftöver Crack]]'s Scott Sturgeon. The album title is a wordplay between [[Crustcore|Crust-Punk]] and a group exercise called [[:en:Trust fall|Trust fall]].<ref name="McDevlin2">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpkE8HdKYCE |title= Cast From The Sewer #35 - Jesse Sendejas (Days N Daze, Escape From The ZOO)|author=McDevlin|date=14 June 2017|work=|accessdate=2018-01-14}}</ref>

{{Quote|"Closure's overrated"|author=Jesse Sendejas<ref name="Noisey" />}}

The dynamic between Flynn and Sendejas has changed considerably over time. While both still consider each other [[Best friends forever|BFF's]] and are still both equally responsible for writing the music of Days N' Daze, a process Sendejas described graphically as two [[Whirlpool|Maelstroms]] rotating against each other,<ref name="Troll2" /> it has become difficult for the both of them to travel in the same vehicle on tour without starting to hurt each other emotionally.<ref name="Noisey" />

Days N' Daze have been playing in their current lineup since 2014. As a replacement for Freddie Boatright, who left the band after having a child, Geoff Bell was recruited in 2013 as their [[gutbucket]] player at an open gutbucket night, five days before the start of an upcoming DnD tour.<ref name="DftU303">{{cite web|url=http://du.libsyn.com/dftunderground-episode-303|title= Dispatches From The Underground - Episode: 303 - Geoff Bell | author=Joey Steel | date=23 February 2016|work=|accessdate=2018-08-08}}</ref> Meagan Michelle joined the band in 2014 when their then washboard player was prohibited from crossing state borders due to legal reasons.<ref name="Noisey" /> Days N' Daze have an extensive history of touring with several known bands and artists including: [[Leftöver Crack]], We the Heathens, The Infamous Stringdusters, M.D.C., Morning Glory, Night Gaunts (NZ), Cancerslug or Black Flag founder Chuck Dukowski's Sextet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reverbnation.com/daysndaze |title= Reverbnation Artist Bio|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref>

On December 20, 2019 Days N' Daze announced that they are working on a new album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/71504/days-n-daze-new-album-to-be-released-via-fat|title=Days N Daze new album to be released via Fat|last=Punknews.org|website=www.punknews.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> On May 1, 2020 the album ''Show Me The Blueprints'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/stream-days-n-dazes-new-album-show-me-the-blueprints/|title=Stream Days N Daze’s new album ‘Show Me The Blueprints’|date=April 30, 2020|accessdate=May 1, 2020|work=[[BrooklynVegan]]|first=Andrew|last=Sacher}}</ref>

== Side projects ==

Both Jesse Sendejas and Whitney Flynn are and have been involved in several side projects over the last couple of years. They play together in [[Decathect]], a band that rather resembles a "normal" [[Punkrock|punk band]] with its layout consisting of vocals (Flynn/Sendejas), guitar, bass and drums (Sendejas). Flynn plays trumpet in this band as well. The name "Decathect" describes the act of withdrawing one's feelings of attachment from a person or idea in the anticipation of future loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/houstons-10-worst-band-names-8894269 |title= Houston's 10 Worst Band Names|author=Houston Press|date=27 October 2016|work=|accessdate=2018-01-13}}</ref> Decathect has only released one demo EP to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://decathect.bandcamp.com/ |title= Decathect Bandcamp|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref>

Together with his sister Marissa, Sendejas is active in a band called [[Chad hates George]] since 2012<ref name="HP2012" /> which has put out two releases thus far.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chadhatesgeorge.bandcamp.com/ |title= Chad hates George Bandcamp|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref> In addition, he is mostly active with his band [[Escape from the Zoo]] with whom he has released two EPs and the album ''KILLACOPTER'' in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://escapefromthezoo.bandcamp.com/ |title= Escape from the Zoo Bandcamp|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref>

Whitney Flynn was an integral part of the [[My Pizza My World]] collective, which she released four EPs and albums with,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mypizzamyworld.bandcamp.com/ |title= My Pizza My World Bandcamp|author=|date=|work=|accessdate=2018-01-06}}</ref> before breaking up in 2016. Today Flynn occasionally plays solo shows as a solo artist under her own name or under her pseudonym "Death By Skwerl". Next to acoustic versions of Days N' Daze or My Pizza My World songs she also plays new songs of hers on guitar or ukulele. She toured as a solo act through [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]] in November 2017.<ref name="McDevlin" />

Both Flynn and Sendejas appeared on various songs of ''Dirty Harry's'' 2018 release ''Get Busy Living Or Get Busy Crying''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dirtyharryfl.bandcamp.com/album/get-busy-living-or-get-busy-crying|author=Dirty Harry|date=31 March 2018|work=Dirty Harry|accessdate=14 April 2018|title=Dirty Harry}}</ref>
