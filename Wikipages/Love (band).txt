'''Love''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles]] in 1965. Led by [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]], Love was one of the first racially diverse American rock bands. Their style, sometimes characterized as [[garage rock]], [[folk rock]], and  [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]],<ref name="Unterberger (Love)"/> drew from an eclectic range of sources including, [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[flamenco]], and [[orchestral pop]].<ref name="Unterberger (Love)"/><ref name="AMG Charts">{{cite web

While finding only modest success on the music charts, peaking in 1966 with their Top 40 hit "[[7 and 7 Is]]", Love would come to be praised by critics as their third album, ''[[Forever Changes]]'' (1967), became generally regarded as one of the best albums of the 1960s.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
Singer/multi-instrumentalist [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]], who was originally from [[Memphis, Tennessee]] but had lived in [[Los Angeles]] since the age of five, had been recording since 1963 with his bands the LAG's and Lee's American Four. He wrote and produced the single "My Diary" for [[Rosa Lee Brooks]] in 1964, which featured [[Jimi Hendrix]] on guitar.<ref name=":4" /> [[Sons of Adam|The Sons Of Adam]], which included future Love drummer Michael Stuart, recorded the Lee composition "Feathered Fish". After attending a performance by [[the Byrds]], Lee decided to form a band that joined the newly minted folk-rock sound of the Byrds to his primarily [[rhythm and blues]] style.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book|last=Strong|first=Martin C.|title=The Great Rock Discography|publisher=Mojo Books|year=2000|isbn=1-84195-017-3|edition=5th|location=Edinburgh|pages=585–586}}</ref>

Singer/guitarist [[Bryan MacLean]], who had met Lee when he was working as a roadie for The Byrds, joined Lee's new band, which was first called the Grass Roots. MacLean had also been playing in bands around Los Angeles since about 1963.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bryan-maclean-mn0000525687/biography|title=Bryan MacLean {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Tobler|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jan/02/guardianobituaries|title=Bryan Maclean obituary|date=1999-01-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-18|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Also joining the band was another Memphis native, lead guitarist [[Johnny Echols]], and drummer Don Conka. A short time later, Conka was replaced by Alban "Snoopy" Pfisterer. Love's first bassist, Johnny Fleckenstein, went on to join the [[Standells]] in 1967. Fleckenstein was replaced by [[Ken Forssi]] (formerly of a post-"[[Wipe Out (song)|Wipe Out]]" lineup of [[The Surfaris]]).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/love-mn0000314600/biography|title=Love {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Upon the appearance of another group called [[The Grass Roots]], Lee changed the name of the new band to Love.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

Love started playing the Los Angeles clubs in April 1965 and became a popular local attraction, while gaining the attention of [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Yardbirds]].<ref name=":0" /> The band lived communally in a house called "the Castle".<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/love-california-dreaming|title=The Man Who Inspired Hendrix: The Crazy World Of Arthur Lee & Love|last=February 2016|first=Max Bell19|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>It was a dilapidated mansion that the band was allowed to live in if they did the maintenance and paid the taxes.  According to John Einerson in the book "Forever Changes", the cover photo of their first two albums was of the band taken in Laurel Canyon at a burned down house that only had the remains of a fireplace left standing.

Their first album, ''[[Love (Love album)|Love]]'', was released in March 1966. The album sold moderately well and reached No.&nbsp;57 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> The single "[[7 and 7 Is]]", released in July 1966, gained notice for the exceptional guitar work of Johnny Echols and proto-punk style drumming of Pfisterer. The single became Love's highest-charting single at No.&nbsp;33 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Two more members were added around this time, Tjay Cantrelli (real name John Barbieri) on woodwinds and Michael Stuart on drums. Pfisterer, never a confident drummer, switched to harpsichord.<ref name=":0" />  Elektra's art director, [[William S. Harvey]], designed a distinctive logo for the band, "four cartoonish letters with exaggerated, curvaceous serifs", incorporating [[gender symbol|male and female symbol]]s.<ref>[https://www.bandlogojukebox.com/blog/2017/11/13/e9p5i07uo77smrwdq2ooqn24bqv0ch Jim K.

Love's second album, ''[[Da Capo (Love album)|Da Capo]]'', was released in November 1966 and included "[[7 and 7 Is]]" as well as the subsequent singles "[[She Comes in Colors]]" and "[[¡Que Vida!]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/da-capo-mw0000195829|title=Da Capo - Love {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> It marked the experimental direction Arthur wanted to take. With the seven member lineup for DaCapo, shortly after this album,  Cantrelli and Pfisterer left the band, leaving it as a five-piece once again.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> Their third album ''[[Forever Changes]]'' was released in November 1967 and was co-produced by Bruce Botnick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/botnick.html|title=Bruce Botnick Interview|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|website=Richieunterberger.com|access-date=20 May 2018}}</ref> The album displayed a softer and more avant-garde approach for the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/forever-changes-mw0000193671|title=Forever Changes - Love {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> By this time, tension arose between Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean, who wanted more of his songs on the album.<ref name=":2" /> The band recorded the album in only 64 hours, though many professional session players were utilized, including some who replaced the actual band members in some songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockreview.com/2012/07/1967-love-forever-changes/|title=Forever Changes by Love album review {{!}} Classic Rock Review|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Writer [[Richard Meltzer]], in his book ''[[The Aesthetics of Rock]]'', commented on Love's "orchestral moves", "post-doper word contraction cuteness", and Lee's vocal style that serves as a "reaffirmation of [[Johnny Mathis]]".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Meltzer|first=Richard|title=The Aesthetics Of Rock|publisher=Hachette Books|year=1987|isbn=0306802872}}</ref> ''Forever Changes'' included one hit single, MacLean's "[[Alone Again Or]]".

=== Later years ===
For unclear reasons, Bryan MacLean left the band after ''Forever Changes''<ref name=":1" /> (though one possible issue was a solo deal that he had signed with Elektra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/love-story|title=LOVE STORY - Record Collector Magazine|website=recordcollectormag.com|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>), while Lee dismissed all the other members.<ref name=":0" /> MacLean later reemerged as a [[Contemporary Christian]] artist.<ref name=":1" /> Johnny Echols and Ken Forssi succumbed to drug addiction and crime, and disappeared from the music scene;<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/love-hurts-6401143|title=Love hurts|last=Scribner|first=Sara|date=1999-03-25|website=Dallas Observer|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> and drummer Michael Stuart also retired from music.<ref name=":7" /> Echols eventually moved to New York and became an in-demand studio musician.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Breznikar|first=Klemen|date=December 29, 2017|title=Love interview with Johnny Echols|url=https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2017/12/love-interview-with-johnny-echols.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102210829/http://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2017/12/love-interview-with-johnny-echols.html|archive-date=January 2, 2018|access-date=February 18, 2020|website=[[It's Psychedelic Baby!

Arthur Lee, as the only remaining member, convened a new lineup of Love with Jay Donnellan (soon replaced by Gary Rowles) on guitar, Frank Fayad on bass, and George Suranovich on drums. This lineup played in a [[blues rock]] style, as opposed to the folk-rock and psychedelic styles of the band's previous incarnation. The new line-up never garnered the widespread acceptance or acclaim of the original group.<ref name=":0" /> Three albums were released by various permutations of this lineup: ''[[Four Sail]]'' (1969), ''[[Out Here (Love album)|Out Here]]'' (1969), and ''[[False Start (Love album)|False Start]]'' (1970).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" /> The last featured a guest appearance by [[Jimi Hendrix]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/false-start-mw0000308241|title=False Start - Love {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Another album by this incarnation of the band was recorded in 1971, but the material was not released until 2009 on the compilation album ''Love Lost''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/love-lost-mw0001777902|title=Love Lost - Love {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Arthur Lee released the solo album ''[[Vindicator (album)|Vindicator]]'' in 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vindicator-mw0000751489|title=Vindicator - Arthur Lee {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref> Another lost Love album titled ''[[Black Beauty (album)|Black Beauty]]'' was recorded in 1973 by a new lineup featuring guitarist Melvan Whittington, bassist Robert Rozelle, and drummer Joe Blocker, but Arthur Lee's record label went out of business before it was released.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, there were various attempts to reunite the original Love lineup. At the suggestion of late-period guitarist John Sterling, Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean reunited for one show in 1978, which was recorded and released as ''Love Live'' in 1980.<ref name=":0" /> Material from ''[[Out Here (Love album)|Out Here]]'' plus four previously unreleased live tracks was released as ''Studio/Live'' in 1982.<ref name=":0" /> Arthur Lee was largely inactive in the 1980s and only made sporadic onstage appearances with pick-up bands.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/arthur-lee-1945-2006-78583/|title=Arthur Lee (1945-2006)|last1=Sullivan|first1=James|date=2006-08-04|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>

Johnny Echols joined Lee's latest group for a special ''Forever Changes'' 35th Anniversary performance in the spring of 2003 and again for tours in 2004 and 2005.<ref name=":5" /> Due to Arthur Lee's battle with [[acute myeloid leukemia]], the details of which were not known by the band at the time, he could not participate in the final tour in 2005. Since no one knew of his illness, Lee's decision to forgo the final tour was met with confused reactions.<ref name=":4" /> The remaining members of the band, led by Echols, continued to perform without Lee, under the name The Love Band.<ref name=":5" />

Michael Stuart-Ware and Johnny Echols performed with Baby Lemonade at Hollywood's Whisky A Go-Go on June 28, 2006 in a benefit concert for Arthur Lee.
