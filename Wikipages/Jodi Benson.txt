==Personal life==
Benson was born and raised in a Catholic environment,<ref name="homecoming">{{cite web|url=http://www.homecomingmagazine.com/article/part-of-her-world-jodi-benson/|title=Part Of Her World: Jodi Benson|last=Gaither|first=Gloria|work=Homecoming Magazine|date=August 1, 2011|quote= I was born and raised in a Catholic environment, she has a sister. I would say it was a little more cultural than spiritual — a little bit more religious than relational. And I was drawing toward the Lord in middle school, but I didn’t quite know how to have that personal relationship at the time. When I started dating my husband at 18, he introduced me to Christ, and asked, “Do you have a relationship with Jesus?” And I said, “I love Him, and I know He’s the Son of God, but I don’t think I have a relationship with Him — like I can talk to Him by myself without going through the priest and stuff.” And so, I had a really big conversion when I was 19, and Ray is responsible for opening that relationship for me.|access-date=December 3, 2016}}</ref> graduating from [[Boylan Catholic High School|Boylan Central Catholic High School]] in Rockford, Illinois,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rrstar.com/article/20100319/BLOGS/303199873|title=Little Mermaid star at Boylan fundraiser April 17|last=Braun|first=Georgette|work=Rockford Register Star|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en}}</ref> and [[Millikin University]] in [[Decatur, Illinois]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://herald-review.com/news/local/reasons-original-ariel-voice-launched-from-millikin/article_6f525514-f853-5ab0-a1c3-d5ecdfd525c8.html|title=100 reason: Original Ariel voice launched from Millikin|last=Cain|first=Tim|work=Decatur Herald & Review|access-date=2020-04-18|language=en}}</ref>

===''The Little Mermaid''===
In late 1986, Benson first heard of the audition for ''The Little Mermaid'' through lyricist and playwright [[Howard Ashman]]. The two had just worked together in the Broadway show ''[[Smile (musical)|Smile]]'' until its run ended early. He knew she would be the perfect fit for the role and that she would be a great replica of Ariel.<ref name="Insider">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/articles/2013/09/30/an-interview-with-jodi-benson-voice-of-ariel |title=An Interview with Jodi Benson, Voice of Ariel  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2014 |website=blogs.disney.com |publisher=Disney Insider |access-date=June 28, 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/02/jodi-benson-the-little-mermaid/2904191 |title='Little Mermaid' star Jodi Benson loves life as Ariel |last1=Truitt |first1=Brian |date=Oct 2, 2013 |publisher=USA Today |access-date=June 28, 2015 }}</ref> After hearing the demo for "Part of Your World", she sang a small part of it on tape where it was later sent to Disney executives. Before her audition for ''The Little Mermaid'', she was primarily a stage actress. It was Ashman's first Disney project. In early 1988, Benson won the role of Ariel.<ref name="Insider" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/news/Jodi-Benson-25-Years-Of-Voicing-Ariel/|title=Jodi Benson: 25 Years Of Voicing Ariel|website=Behind The Voice Actors|access-date=Jun 17, 2019}}</ref>
