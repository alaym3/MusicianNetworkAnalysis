==Biography==
{{Further|Masabumi Hosono|Happy End (band)|Yellow Magic Orchestra}}
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}
Hosono is the grandson of [[Masabumi Hosono]], the only Japanese passenger and survivor of the sinking of [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. Hosono first came to attention in Japan as the bass player of the [[psychedelic rock]] band Apryl Fool, alongside drummer [[Takashi Matsumoto (lyricist)|Takashi Matsumoto]], who released the album ''The Apryl Fool'' in 1969. Hosono and Matsumoto then formed the influential [[folk rock]] group [[Happy End (band)|Happy End]] with [[Eiichi Ohtaki]] and [[Shigeru Suzuki]].<ref name="HMV">{{cite web| title=Top 100 Japanese pops Artists – No.4| work=hmv.co.jp| language=ja| url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/news/newsDetail.asp?newsnum=311040087| access-date=2013-04-26}}</ref> One of the songs he composed for Happy End, "[[Kazemachi Roman|Kaze wo Atsumete]]" (1971), later appeared in the American film ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' and on [[Lost in Translation (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecranlarge.com/article-details-5155.php|title=Bande originale : Lost in translation|date=August 18, 2005|access-date=2008-03-23|publisher=EcranLarge}}</ref> After ''Happy End'' disbanded around 1974, Hosono worked with Suzuki and a loose association of artists making "[[exotica]]"-style music under the title ''Tin Pan Alley''.

His involvement in [[electronic music]] also dates back to the early 1970s, when he performed the [[Electric upright bass|electric bass]] for [[Inoue Yousui]]'s folk [[pop rock]] album ''Ice World'' (1973) and [[Osamu Kitajima]]'s [[Progressive rock|progressive]]/psychedelic rock album ''[[Benzaiten]]'' (1974), both of which were [[Electronics in rock music|electronic rock]] records utilizing synthesizers, electric guitars, and in the latter, [[electronic drum]]s and [[Drum machine|rhythm machines]].<ref>{{Discogs release|2509617|井上陽水&nbsp;– 氷の世界}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http://www.discogs.com/%E4%BA%95%E4%B8%8A%E9%99%BD%E6%B0%B4-%E6%B0%B7%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C/release/2509617 Translation])</ref><ref>{{Discogs release|1303605|Osamu Kitajima&nbsp;– Benzaiten}}</ref>

In 1977, Hosono invited [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Yukihiro Takahashi]] to work on his [[exotica]]-flavoured album ''[[Paraiso (Haruomi Hosono album)|Paraiso]]'', which included electronic music produced using the [[Yamaha CS-80]] [[polyphonic synthesizer]] and [[ARP Odyssey]] synthesizer. The band was named "Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band" and, having been recorded in late 1977, ''Paraiso'' was released in early 1978.<ref name="discogs_paraiso">{{Discogs release|1188801|Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band&nbsp;– Paraiso}}</ref> The three worked together again for the 1978 electronic album ''Pacific'', which included an early version of the song "Cosmic Surfin'".<ref>{{Discogs release|2561274|Pacific}}</ref>

In 1978, he released an innovative electronic soundtrack for a [[Fictional film|fictional]] [[Bollywood]] film, ''Cochin Moon'', together with artist [[Tadanori Yokoo]] and future YMO band members Ryuichi Sakamoto and [[Hideki Matsutake]]. Inspired by a trip to [[India]] and "the exotic, luxurious, and seemingly wonder-filled scenarios played out in [[Cinema of India|Indian cinemas]]", it was an experimental "electro-exotica" album [[Fusion (music)|fusing]] exotic [[Music of India|Indian music]] (reminiscent of [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Filmi|Bollywood music]]) with electronic music, including an early "[[Synthpop|synth]] [[raga]]" song entitled "Hum Ghar Sajan" (from a [[Guru Granth Sahib]] phrase).<ref>{{cite web|author=Dominique Leone|date=July 19, 2005|title=Hosono & Yokoo: Cochin Moon|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4016-cochin-moon/|access-date=2011-05-26}}</ref> The same year, he contributed to Sakamoto's song "1000 Knives" for his solo album, ''[[Thousand Knives]]'', which experimented with fusing electronic music with traditional [[Music of Japan|Japanese music]] in early 1978.<ref>{{Discogs release|325757|Ryuichi Sakamoto&nbsp;– Thousand Knives Of}}</ref>

He was one of the first producers to recognize the appeal of [[Video game music|video game sounds and music]]. YMO's self-titled debut in 1978 contained substantial video game sounds and after YMO disbanded an early project was an album simply titled ''Video Game Music'' containing mixed and edited [[Namco]] [[arcade game]] music and sounds. ''Video Game Music'' was released in 1984 as an early example of a [[chiptune]] record<ref>{{Discogs master|190001|Haruomi Hosono&nbsp;– Video Game Music|type=album}}</ref> and the first video game music album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xevious|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|page=2|author=Carlo Savorelli|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/xevious/xevious2.htm|access-date=2011-06-11}}</ref> That same year, he also produced the theme song for [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s popular [[anime]] film ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'', "Kaze no Tani no Naushika", with vocals by actress-singer [[Narumi Yasuda]].<ref name="nausicaa_credits">{{cite web|title=Kaze no Tani no Naushika (Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind): Credits, Figures & Other Information|publisher=[[Nausicaa.net]]|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/nausicaa/credits.html|access-date=2011-06-23}}</ref> In the late 80s and early 90s, the influence of [[world music]] on his music deepened, and he worked with international singers and musicians such as [[Amina Annabi]].

He has produced a number of short-term band projects as a band member. His first post-YMO band was Friends of Earth. As with most of his projects he combines musical styles he's interested in. F.O.E. seemed to be a combination of funk and techno, and included a collaboration with [[James Brown]] and [[Maceo Parker]] for a remake of the song "[[Sex Machine (song)|Sex Machine]]". Another notable band project was 1995's Love, Peace & Trance. Members were [[Mimori Yusa]] ("Love"), Miyako Koda ("Peace"), Haruomi Hosono ("&") and Mishio Ogawa ("Trance").

In the 1990s he started the [[Daisyworld]] label to release a wide range of experimental artists from Japan and the rest of the world. Hosono collaborated on many of the releases, such as [[World Standard]], a trip into Americana; HAT, a supergroup (the acronym stands for Hosono, [[Atom Heart]], [[Tetsu Inoue]]), and "Quiet Logic", by [[Mixmaster Morris]] and [[Jonah Sharp]]. [[The Orb]] also paid tribute with a series of remixes including the notorious "Hope You Choke on Your Whalemeat".

[[File:YMOHosono2008(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Hosono performing with YMO in 2008.]]
In 2002 Haruomi formed the duo [[Sketch Show (band)|Sketch Show]] with his YMO bandmate [[Yukihiro Takahashi]]. They have released two albums, one of which, ''Loophole'', has received a UK release. When the third former YMO member, [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] deepened his involvement it was decided to bill those collaborations as [[Human Audio Sponge]].

In the spring of 2007, his fellow YMO members and other artist paid tribute to Haruomi with a 2-disc album titled ''Tribute to Haruomi''. That same year, the animated film ''[[Appleseed Ex Machina]]'' was released featuring a soundtrack performed and supervised by Hosono.

In September 2010 he performed at the De La Fantasia festival and played songs from his upcoming album.

In February 2011 it was announced that his new album, entitled ''HoSoNoVa'', was to be released on April 20. He also performed a special concert to celebrate its release. 

In May 2018, [[Light in the Attic Records]] announced a CD and vinyl reissue of five of Hosono's albums—''Hosono House'', ''Cochin Moon'', ''Paraiso'', ''Philharmony'' and ''omni Sight Seeing''—for release in August and September 2018.  The former four albums had never been released outside of Japan previously.  Coinciding was the announcement that Hosono would play his first UK concerts as a solo artist in June; the shows were scheduled as part of Sakamoto's MODE festival happening throughout England in June and July. The June 23 concert at the [[Barbican Centre]] in London featured an appearance by his YMO bandmates, with whom he performed his ''Solid State Survivor'' composition "Absolute Ego Dance".

2019 marked Hosono's 50th anniversary in the music industry. On March 6, he released ''Hochono House'', a mostly electronic remake of his solo debut ''[[Hosono House]]'' that reversed the track listing. That spring, he performed his first solo shows in the U.S. This run included two sold-out shows at the [[Gramercy Theatre]] in New York City and a concert at the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles. The second New York show saw an appearance by current NYC resident [[Akiko Yano]], who collaborated with Hosono in Tin Pan Alley, as a live support member of YMO, and as a solo artist; she sang Hosono's "Ai Ai Gasa", which she covered on her 1977 album ''Iroha Ni Konpeitou''. In LA, Canadian indie rock musician [[Mac DeMarco]]—whose vocal admiration of Hosono has spread to a portion of his own fanbase—appeared during the show to perform "Honey Moon" as a duet with Hosono; Light in the Attic had recently released a cover of the song on a 7" single record, backed with the original version.

In the autumn of 2019, an exhibition on Hosono's career—"Hosono Sightseeing"—was on display in Tokyo Sky View at the [[Roppongi Hills Mori Tower]]; along with other memorabilia, this featured many of the instruments associated with Hosono, such as the [[Roland TR-808]], [[E-mu Emulator]], and [[Prophet-5]]. A documentary film, ''No Smoking'', was also released, including footage from the U.S. and UK shows; appearances include Sakamoto, Takahashi, Demarco, longtime friend [[Van Dyke Parks]], and protégé [[Gen Hoshino]].
