Salvat is openly [[bisexual]] and has stated, "I've had numerous relationships with both genders so my songs are usually pronoun neutral.

It gives texture to their sound."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiskind.com/2015/08/josef-salvat-my-experiences-of-sexuality-are-very-fluid/|title=JOSEF SALVAT: "MY EXPERIENCES OF SEXUALITY ARE VERY FLUID"|publisher=hiskind.net|accessdate=28 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225050947/http://hiskind.com/2015/08/josef-salvat-my-experiences-of-sexuality-are-very-fluid/|archive-date=25 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
