==History==
===Formation (1997–1999)===
The Plain White T's was formed in Lombard in early 1997. The group began as a trio, with Higgenson as singer and guitarist, Fletcher on bass guitar and Tirio on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.100xr.com/100_XR/Artists/P/Plain_White_T_s.htm |title=Plain White T's Biography, Music News, Discography  |publisher=100xr.com |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/plain_white_t_s/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd |title=Plain White T's &#124; Music Videos, News, Photos, Tour Dates, Ringtones, and Lyrics |publisher=MTV |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> The group played mostly local punk shows in Chicago's suburbs, eventually having gigs at the Metro in Chicago's [[Wrigleyville]] neighborhood. As the band began to establish itself in the local scene, a fourth member, Steve Mast, was recruited. He played lead guitar and sang backing vocals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Plain+White+T%27s/+wiki |title=Plain White T's: Biography |publisher=Last.fm |access-date=May 15, 2013}}</ref>

In 2000, the band recorded its first album, titled ''Come on Over''.
