'''Soda Stereo''' was an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1982 by [[Gustavo Cerati]] (lead vocals, guitar), Héctor "Zeta" Bosio (bass) and Carlos Alberto Ficicchia "Charly Alberti" (drums). As the first hispanic group to achieve mainstream success in [[Latin America]], critics have considered the group as one of the most influential and popular [[Rock en español|Spanish-language rock]] bands.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cuando Soda Stereo salió a la conquista del continente - LA NACION|newspaper=La Nación|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/espectaculos/musica/cuando-soda-stereo-salio-a-la-conquista-del-continente-nid1986546/}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_VwNQJFqnU</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=4 September 2014|title=Gustavo Cerati, el rockero que conquistó Latinoamérica|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20140904/54415678015/gustavo-cerati-el-rockero-que-conquisto-latinoamerica.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Rojas|first1=Yumber Vera|date=5 September 2014|title=Cerati, el músico que modernizó y popularizó el rock en Latinoamérica|newspaper=El País|url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2014/09/05/actualidad/1409904545_303288.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=4 September 2014|title=Cómo Soda Stereo marcó al rock latinoamericano|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2014/09/140904_herencia_musical_gustavo_cerati}}</ref> The band ventured into many styles, such as "[[música divertida]]" ("fun music") in their beginnings, [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Dark wave|darkwave]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]] and [[electronic rock]] during their final years.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1982-1984)===
In the summer of 1982 Gustavo Cerati, at 22 years of age, and Hector Zeta Bosio, at 23 years of age, collided at [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]], both studying majors. At the time, both men were part of rock bands, Cerati with his group Sauvage and Bosio with the Morgan. Cerati and Bosio, each drawn together by the other's musical tastes, established a friendship and a musical bond that encouraged them to start playing together. Cerati first joined Bosio's group ''The Morgan'', then formed ''Stress'' with Charly Amato and drummer Pablo Guadalupe, also working on the project ''Erekto'' with bandmate [[Andres Calamaro]]. Both projects did not meet Cerati's expectations, however, and both fell through.

Meanwhile, Cerati's sister, Maria Laura Cerati, saw herself repeatedly harassed by Carlos Ficicchia, a man she had met in [[Río de la Plata Basin|River Plate]], [[Argentina]] who called repeatedly to ask her out, all advances of which she rejected.<ref name="Lernoud">Lernoud, Pipo: ''Enciclopedia Rock Nacional 30 Años. De la A a la Z'', page 206. Buenos Aires: Mordisco, 1996. (Spanish)</ref> On one occasion, when Cerati answered the phone for his sister, he entered a deep musical conversation with Ficicchia, who mentioned that he was a drummer, and the son of famous Argentine [[jazz]] drummer and songwriter [[Tito Alberti]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/1998/04/18/c-02401d.htm |title=Tito Alberti: El Otro Baterista |author=Garcia, Fernando |date=18 April 1998 | language = es|publisher=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] |access-date=8 December 2007}}</ref> Interested in his talents after hearing him play, Cerati and Bosio would ask him to join the band{{ndash}}if he would cut his hair. It was during this time that Ficicchia would adopt the stage name "[[Charly Alberti]]".

The band, after experimenting with multiple names, eventually settled on the name ''los Estereotipos'' (the Stereotypes), which referenced a song by the Specials which they enjoyed listening to.<ref name="Estereotipos">{{cite web |url=http://www.galeon.com/eltemblor/Historia/1982.html |title=Historia de Soda Stereo: Los Estereotipos | language = es |publisher=El Galeón |access-date=8 December 2007}}</ref> The band would record a demo under this name, with {{illm|Richard Coleman (guitarist)|es|Richard Coleman|lt=Richard Coleman}} on backing guitar, a short-lived member of the band who was recruited to "beef up" the guitar sound.<ref name="Lernoud" /> The songs recorded would include "Porque No Puedo Ser Del Jet Set?" (Why Can't I be Part of the Jet Set?), which would become a hit single for the band on their [[Soda Stereo (album)|debut studio album]]. Other songs recorded included "Dime Sebastian" (Tell Me Sebastian) and "Debo Soñar" (I Must Dream) by {{illm|Ulises Butrón|es|Ulises Butron}}, in which Ulises Butrón played guitars and {{illm|Daniel Melero|es|Daniel Melero}} played keyboards; Melero, a growing figurehead of Argentina's [[electronic rock]] scene, would become an instrumental influence on the band's sound in its final years.

The trio, regretting using cliches in their band name (claiming that "Los" (The) in a rock-band name was overused), would often brainstorm random words and write them down, a university pastime for Cerati and Bosio{{ndash}}eventually coming up with ''Soda Stereo'', thanks in part to Cerati's excessive [[soft drink|soda]] consumption during band rehearsals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clavenoticias.com.ar/spip.php?article1955 |title=Por qué se llaman así las bandas de música |language=es |publisher=Clave Noticias |access-date=3 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316140701/http://www.clavenoticias.com.ar/spip.php?article1955 |archive-date=16 March 2014 }}</ref>

The first show under ''Soda'''s new name occurred in December 1982, at {{illm|Alfredo Lois|es|Alfredo Lois}} birthday party, Cerati and Bosio's university classmate. Lois would go on to become Soda's video director as well as their visual and stylistic guru; he would later be recognised by Cerati himself as "the fourth Soda member".<ref name="pepsi">{{cite web |url=http://www.terra.com.ar/canales/Pop_Rock/124/124800.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904020509/http://www.terra.com.ar/canales/Pop_Rock/124/124800.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 September 2017 |title=''Entrevista en el Pepsi Music Cerati: "A Veces el Rock no Quiere Crecer" |author=Feijoo, Sebastian |date=13 October 2005 | language = es |access-date=8 December 2007}}</ref> Shortly after this first show, Richard Coleman, fourth member, left the band on good terms, recognizing that the band sounded better without him.

In July 1983 the now-trio made their debut at the Discothèque Airport in the [[Buenos Aires]] neighborhood of [[Belgrano (Buenos Aires)|Belgrano, Buenos Aires]]. The band reminisced on this show:

<blockquote>Our debut was at a fashion show at the "Disco Airport" (Discothèque), which was close to where we practiced in Buenos Aires. Nobody gave us so much as a nod. The three of us played on a very deficient sound system. But we were happy, even though no one paid attention. We really looked like a punk group, we didn't know how to play and the sound was loud, even though it was just that.<ref name="pepsi"/></blockquote>

Following that gig, Soda Stereo would gain slow traction throughout the underground rock scene of Buenos Aires, making a name for themselves alongside other emerging bands at the time, such as ''[[Sumo (band)|Sumo]]'', ''[[Los Twist]]'', ''[[Los Encargados]]'' (with [[Daniel Melero]]), and other bands. Soda would take up residency at the traditional and deteriorated Cabaret Marabú club in Maipú 359.<ref name="Lernoud" /> At these early shows, Soda would play songs like "Héroes de la Serie" (Heroe of the series), "La Vi Parada Alli" (I saw her standing there), and "Vamos a La Playa" (Let's go to the beach), along with other songs that appeared on their second demo.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Lounge/6160/HISTORIA.HTM |title=Historia de Soda |author=Peña, Jose E. | language = es |access-date=30 August 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Lounge/6160/HISTORIA.HTM&date=2009-10-26+16:56:59|archive-date=26 October 2009}}</ref>

Throughout 1983, the band would become slightly notorious for their sound. Beginning at a pub show for a no-show band, Soda would begin a period of constant shows; at their third show, Horacio Martinez, a historic Argentine rock producer and "talent hunter", heard them and would quickly invite them to record for [[CBS]]. This came to fruition in 1984 when Soda signed to the Rodríguez Ares agency.<ref name="Lernoud" /><ref>" Argentine producer Horacio Martínez is credited with the 'discovery' of [[Tanguito]], [[Los Gatos (band)|Los Gatos]] and [[Mauricio "Moris" Birabent|Moris]]".</ref>

===First album and Chateau Rock '85 (1984-1985)===
[[File:Several television sets.jpg|thumb| "Sobredosis de TV" was chosen as the first single for the first Soda Stereo album ''Soda Stereo'', released on 14 December 1984. The video-clip for "Dietético" aired on Música Total on [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Canal 9]] and had a considerable impact.<ref name="Estereotipos"/>]]
Soda Stereo recorded their debut during the second half of 1984. The album was produced by [[Federico Moura]], vocalist for [[Virus (Argentine band)|Virus]]. By that time, Moura and Cerati had developed a fruitful artistic relationship. The recording took place in the defunct studios of [[CBS]] on Paraguay street. The end result was cooler sound than of the live shows, which the bands were pleased with. The trio was aided by {{illm|Daniel Melero|es|Daniel Melero}} on keys and {{illm|Gonzo Palacios|es|Gonzo Palacios}} on sax. Both were listed as "guest musicians", a practice which would become common for Soda throughout their career. Such guest musicians would be recognized by the public as the "fourth Sodas".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zonadepromesasweb.com.ar/Ver-Noticias/soda_stereo_nota_el_cuarto_soda-480/&tipo=Nota&relacion=Soda%20Stereo |title=El Cuarto Soda |year=2007 |language=es |work=Rolling Stone Argentina |access-date=8 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113121354/http://www.zonadepromesasweb.com.ar/Ver-Noticias/soda_stereo_nota_el_cuarto_soda-480/%26tipo%3DNota%26relacion%3DSoda%20Stereo |archive-date=13 November 2007 }}</ref>

The attention garnered by Soda was manifested in their playing of larger and larger venues. First was "La Esquina Del Sol" in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]]. "El Recital De Los Lagos" on 1 and 2 December was their first multi-headlining show with top Argentine acts.<ref>Some of the artists who played that show were: Virus, [[Juan Carlos Baglietto]], [[:es:GIT|GIT]], [[:es:Suéter (banda)|Suéter]], [[:es:Miguel Mateos|Zas]], [[Los Abuelos de la Nada]], [[:es:Marilina Ross|Marilina Ross]], [[:es:Celeste Carballo|Celeste Carballo]], and [[Sandra Mihanovich]].{{Better source|date=October 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> The show was hosted by Argentinean television personality {{illm|Juan Alberto Badía|es|Juan Alberto Badia}}.

Soda Stereo presented their debut album at El Teatro Astros on 14 December 1984, it was their first show there. The stage was designed by Alfredo Lois, who for the occasion located 26 television sets in the background. The TVs were turned on and out of sync with each other - the theme of "Sobredosis de TV" (TV Overdose). The TVs, together with a large amount of smoke, created an unusual but captivating visual effect.<ref name="rock.com.ar">{{cite web |url=http://www.rock.com.ar/bios/0/200.shtml |title= Soda Stereo | language = es|publisher=Rock.com.ar |access-date=8 December 2007}}</ref>

On 26 January 1985 Soda played the Rock in Bali festival in Argentine port city of [[Mar del Plata]]. On 17 March they played the Festival Chateau Rock '85 at the [[Estadio Olímpico Chateau Carreras]] in [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba Province]]. The official biography of the band attaches great importance to this appearance, indicating that the band played for 15 thousand people and that they were the revelation of the festival.<ref name="oficial">{{cite web |url=http://sodastereo.com/historia/ |title=Soda Stereo: Pagina Oficial: Historia |language=es |access-date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818075909/http://sodastereo.com/historia/ |archive-date=18 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, Córdoba media outlets claim that, "only half the number of people actually showed up and that Soda were hardly noticed because their first record had was just released a few months earlier." They also added "[[Raul Porchetto]] was the biggest draw of the night".<ref name="Fernet">{{cite web|url=http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=142196|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205232309/http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=142196|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 December 2012|title=Fernet Con Soda|language=es|publisher=Diario [[La Voz del Interior]]|access-date=10 December 2007}}</ref> Regardless, their presence at Chateau sparked a personal relationship between the band the youth of Córdoba, it marked the moment that the band began to take flight toward national stardom.<ref name="lavoz">{{cite web|url=http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/07/12/01/secciones/espectaculos/nota.asp?nota_id=139629|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121230061128/http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/07/12/01/secciones/espectaculos/nota.asp?nota_id=139629|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 December 2012|title=Tras los pasos de Soda Stereo en Córdoba|date=7 December 2001|language=es|publisher=Diario [[La Voz del Interior]]|access-date=8 December 2007}}</ref>

The success of the band began at a very peculiar time, related, on the one hand with the [[Raúl Alfonsín|return of democracy to Argentina]] (10 December 1983), and on the other hand, with increasing notions of [[postmodernism]], particularly in the way the 1980s youth created their role in a newly democratic society, one that had just emerged from bloody [[Dirty War|dictatorship]] and [[Falklands War|war]].

Years later, [[Zeta Bosio]] would reflect on this juncture:

<blockquote>The democracy produced the adrenalin of something new, something was occurring, I knew I was going to make changes without knowing how. There was more air for us to make things and to wander, and we were a band of kids that wanted to make trouble. Our attention was on punk and on trying to show that there was something else that was more direct<ref name="desde">{{cite web |url= http://www.desdeabajoweb.com.ar/soda.htm |title= Informe Especial: Soda Stereo (Spanish) |publisher=Desde Abajo Diario [[La Voz del Interior]]|access-date=8 December 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026033539/http://www.desdeabajoweb.com.ar/soda.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 26 October 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

On 13 October of that year, Soda played in front of a large audience in Buenos Aires as part of the third night of the Festival of Rock and Pop Held at the [[José Amalfitani Stadium]] home of the soccer club [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Velez Sarsfield]] . They shared the stage with [[INXS]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Charly García]], Virus, and [[Sumo (band)|Sumo]], among others. By then Fabian "Vön" Quintero and Gonzo Palacios were "stable guests".

}}
Soda's second álbum ''[[Nada personal (album)|Nada personal]]'' was edited in October 1985. During the summer the group toured Argentina, playing in [[Mar de Plata]], [[Villa Gesell]], and [[Pinamar]], and ending the tour at the Festival De la Falda in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], which featured [[Andres Calamaro]] and [[Charly García]] on keyboards on "Jet Set".

In April the band decided to officially present the album at a concert at the [[Arena Obras Sanitarias|Estadio Obras Sanitarias]] in Buenos Aires. There they did four shows with a total attendance of 20,000 spectators. Footage from the first show was edited into a long play video. After these concerts records sales began to increase at an accelerated rate, quickly passing the [[Gold certification]] that they had achieved during the summer, [[platinum certification]], and finally double platinum in the following months. Without abandoning the danceable rhythms, the second LP resulted in more depth in the lyrics and a melodical maturity.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

=== Latin American success (1986-1989) ===
[[File:Viña 2006 - 2do día.JPG|thumb|In 1986 hundreds of [[Chile|Chilean youths]] received Soda Stereo as popular idols. The song that created this first contact was "Nada Personal ([[:es:Nada Personal (canción)|:es]])" (Nothing Personal) which became a radio hit. A little later in February 1987 Soda had a strong showing at the [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]], again in Chile. This, in effect, opened the doors to the rest of Latin America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galeon.com/eltemblor/Historia/1986.html |title=1986: America es de Soda |language= es |publisher=El Galeón |access-date=8 December 2007 }}</ref>]]

In 1986 Soda Stereo made their first Latin American tour, called Signos - still touring with the Nada Personal record. The band played in [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]] with considerable success. In Chile they gave four performances in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], on 21, 22, 24, and 25 November, and one in [[Valparaíso]] on 22 November 1986. In November 1986 Soda arrived in Peru for the first time and revolutionized the market. Their album sales were good and their three shows at the Amauta Coliseum were successful.

At that time Latin Rock was not that popular with the youth of Latin America (with the exceptions of Argentina and Uruguay) and bands were not accustomed to international tours.<ref name="Bailando">{{cite web |url= http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-191-2002-05-12.html |title= Bailando Sobre Los Escombros de Carlos Polimeni |author=Zeiger, Claudio |date=12 May 2002 | language = es |access-date=8 December 2007}}</ref>

On 10 November 1986 the band released their third album ''[[Signos]]''. With its lead single "Persiana Americana" ([[:es:Persiana americana|:es]]) (American Blinds), ''Signos'' was a key step for Soda Stereo, who by now had come under a great deal of stress due to ever increasing factors: sales expectations, external pressures, the risk of failure, and internal tensions. The band was joined in the studio by {{illm|Fabián Vön Quintiero|es|Fabián Vön Quintiero}} on keys, Richard Coleman on guitar and {{illm|Celsa Mel Gowland|es|Celsa Mel Gowland}} on back up vocals. ''Signos'' became the first Argentine rock album to be released on compact disc. It was manufactured in the Netherlands and distributed throughout Latin America.<ref name="signos">{{cite web|url=http://www.zonadepromesasweb.com.ar/Soda_Stereo/Discografia/Oficiales/Signos/ |title=Sitio No Oficial de Soda Stereo.

On 3 December Soda made their first appearance in Ecuador. In early 1987 Soda returned to Chile, this time to the [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]] where they won the prize "Antorcha de Plata" (Silver Torch). The festival was broadcast via television to many Latin American countries, expanding the band's fame throughout the continent. It did not take long to transform itself into a massive unconditional following which was called "Sodamania".

On 23 April 1987, Soda broke records for ticket sales in [[Paraguay]] with their show at the Yacht Club. Meanwhile, ''Signos'' reached Platinum status in Argentina, triple platinum in [[Perú]] and double platinum in Chile. Soda's first show in Mexico occurred on 4 August 1987 at the Magic Circus in [[Mexico City]].

The ''Signos'' tour was a milestone for Soda as they played 22 concerts in 17 cities to almost 350,000 fans, in the process opening up the idea that Latin Rock can transcend the nationalities of the bands, something that would come to fruition in the upcoming decade. With live recordings from different shows, a live album ''Ruido Blanco'' was compiled in 1987. Mixed in Barbados, it was considered by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (Argentina) to be one of the top 5 live albums of Argentine Rock.<ref name="top 5 live">{{cite web |url= http://my-musik.com/article3953.html |title= Top 10 Discos En Vivo Argentinos |language= es |work= Rolling Stone (Argentina) |access-date= 9 December 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016015538/http://my-musik.com/article3953.html |archive-date= 16 October 2007 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

[[File:Doble vida cover sodastereo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Released in 1988, ''Doble Vida'' was the fourth studio album of Soda Stereo.]]
In late 1988 Soda Stereo were considered the most important band of Latin American pop/rock.<ref name="Doble Vida - AllMusic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/doble-vida-mw0000467318|title=Doble Vida - Soda Stereo - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/303256/gustavo-cerati/biography|title=Gustavo Cerati - Biography {{!}} Billboard|website=www.billboard.com|access-date=3 April 2016}}</ref> They began to work on a new album alongside Puerto Rican producer [[Carlos Alomar]]. Alomar had worked with [[David Bowie]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Simple Minds]], [[Iggy Pop]], and [[Paul McCartney]], among others. ''[[Doble Vida]]'' (Double Life) was recorded and mixed in New York City, and was the first record by an Argentine band to be completely recorded abroad.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r101373|pure_url=yes}} |title=Doble Vida (Overview) |author=Adaime, Iván|publisher=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=1 April 2007}}</ref>

The album produced four singles, "Picnic en el 4º B" (Picnic in Room 4B), "[[En la Ciudad de la Furia]]" (In the City of Fury), and "Lo Que Sangra (La Cúpula)" (That Which Bleeds (The Dome), and "Corazón Delator" ([[The Tell-Tale Heart|Tell-Tale Heart]]).<ref name=":0" /> The video for "En La Ciudad de La Furia", directed by Alfredo Lois, was a finalist for an [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Award]] in the category of best foreign video (there was no Latin MTV at the time).

After more than a year without playing in Buenos Aires, Soda showcased ''Doble Vida'' at the hockey field at Obras in front of 25,000 fans. To top of a stellar year, Soda headlined the Three Days for Democracy Festival, which took place in Buenos Aires on the intersection of Avenida del Libertador and 9 de Julio. The show was attended by 150,000 people and Soda shared the stage with [[Luis Alberto Spinetta]] [[Fito Páez]], [[Los Ratones Paranoicos]], {{illm|Man Ray (band)|es|Man Ray (banda)|lt=Man Ray}}, and others.

With sales of a million copies of ''Doble Vida'' under their belt, Soda began a massive tour in early 1989. The tour began with 30 shows in Argentina, covering most of the country, which were attended by nearly 270,000 fans. These shows were followed by a new Latin American tour (their third), which cemented a massive following in [[Mexico]].

Near the end of 1989 Soda records a new version of "Languis" (from ''Doble Vida'') and a new song titled "Mundo de Quimeras" (World of Chimeras). Both songs were released in the EP ''Languis'' (1989) along with remixes of "En El Borde" and "Lo Que Sangra (La Cúpula)". Following the release of ''Languis'' Soda played two sold-out shows at The Palace in Los Angeles, becoming the second [[Rock en Español]] to play in the United States, following [[Miguel Mateos]].

=== The Consecration: ''Canción Animal'' (1990-1991) ===
The album ''[[Canción Animal]]'', released in 1990, is considered to be one of the best albums of all time of the Latin Rock genre.<ref name="musiteka.net">[http://www.musiteka.net/2010/12/250-albums-del-rock-iberoamericano/ Un viaje por los 250 discos del rock Iberoamericano] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102013630/http://www.musiteka.net/2010/12/250-albums-del-rock-iberoamericano/ |date=2 January 2011 }} Revista AlBorde</ref>

In early 1990 the band co-headlined a show for 32,000 people with British new wave band [[Tears for Fears]] at the [[José Amalfitani Stadium]] in Buenos Aires.

Soda Stereo then traveled to Criteria Studios in [[Miami, Florida]] to begin work on their fifth album. They would enlist the help of {{illm|Daniel Melero|es|Daniel Melero}}, [[Andrea Álvarez]], and [[Tweety González]] (all very important figures in the Argentine rock scene of the time).

The resulting album ''Canción Animal'' (1990) is considered to be one of the best albums in the history of Latin rock. It contains their best known song "[[De Música Ligera]]" (Of Light Music), as well as other classics such as "Canción Animal" (Animal Song), "Un Millón de Años Luz" (A Million Light Years), "En el Séptimo Día" (On the Seventh Day), and "Té Para Tres" (Tea For Three). These songs are considered to be the band's strongest and at the same time are their most popular.<ref name="amgca">{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r101372|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Canción Animal'' > Overview | access-date = 4 January 2007 | last = Adaime | first = Iván | work = [[Allmusic]] }}</ref> Overall, the album is considered as the most consistent work by the band, along with ''Signos''.<ref name="amgca" />

Their massive tour ''Animal'' (1990–1991) included 30 Argentine cities, many which had not been visited by a band with the reach of Soda Stereo. The cities visited in Argentina were: [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], [[Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz]], Junín, [[Clorinda, Formosa|Clorinda]], [[Puerto Iguazú]], [[Trelew]], [[Neuquén]], Santa Rosa, [[Trenque Lauquen]] [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Río Cuarto, Córdoba|Río Cuarto]], [[Santiago del Estero]], [[San Miguel de Tucumán]], [[Salta]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], Buenos Aires, [[Olavarria]], [[Pergamino]]. International cities included: [[Santiago de Chile]], [[Asunción]], [[Punta del Este]], [[Barquisimeto]], [[Caracas]], Valencia, [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], San Cristóbal, Mexico City, [[Monterrey, Mexico|Monterrey]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexicali]], and [[Tijuana]].

The tour finished with 14 consecutive shows at the Grand Rex Theater in Buenos Aires. With a 3,300 person capacity, this was a noticeable achievement at the time.<ref>two years later [[Sandro de América|Sandro]] would play 40 consecutive shows at the Grand Rex</ref> Some of the Grand Rex shows would appear on the live EP ''Rex Mix'' (1991), which included remixed versions of a new song, "No Necesito Verte (Para Saberlo)" (I don't Need to See You - To Know).

[[File:Buenos Aires-Av. 9 de julio.jpg|thumb|left|[[9 de Julio Avenue|Avenida 9 de Julio]] in Buenos Aires. On 14 December 1991 Soda gave a free concert here to more than 250,000 people.]]

By late 1991 Soda's continental success brought the band to the attention of MTV News Europe, who began to take notice of what was taking place in Latin America, particularly with [[Rock en Español]]. MTV unconditionally dedicated a whole show to Soda - a first for non English singing band.<ref name="Costa">{{cite web|url=http://aerosoda.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!162B7F502C77AB90!597.entry |title=Soda Stereo: 1982&ndash;2007, Me Verás Volver |author=Kon, Daniel and Robert Costa |date=10 October 2007 |language=es |publisher=Aerosoda |access-date=9 December 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In May 1992 Soda embarked on a tour of Spain with shows in [[Madrid]], [[Oviedo]], [[Sevilla]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], and [[Barcelona]]. The lackluster results of the Spanish tour, compared to the fervor they were accustomed to in Latin America, left a sour taste in their mouths. Nevertheless, it did serve as a valid experience, specifically in bringing the band back to earth. To put it bluntly: Spain was in no way a failure, but was far from the success that Soda had been used to in Latin America, in the end it was a good learning experience.<ref name="Costa" />

===Experimentation and change in style: ''Dynamo'', Cerati's solo career, and musical hiatus (1992-1994)===

====''Dynamo'', related tours and Cerati's solo career (1992-1993)====
In March 1992, Argentinian producer and musician Daniel Melero and Gustavo Cerati released an album titled ''[[Colores Santos]]'', Cerati's first musical venture away from the band. Heavily influenced by Melero's experimentation with [[electronic music]], it was stylistically not indicative of Cerati's "rock-centered" works, instead choosing to follow a drastically different pattern containing elements from [[neo-psychedelia]] and [[dream pop]]. Cerati would depart to Spain immediately following the album's release for touring with Soda Stereo{{spaced ndash}}upon returning that May, the band immediately began work on new music.

Nearing the end of 1992 Soda began showcasing their sixth studio album ''[[Dynamo (Soda Stereo album)|Dynamo]]'', first introduced to the public with six concerts at Obras. The band also showcased the album in its entirety in a local talk-show, ''Fax'', famous for being the first [[Stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] TV transmission in Argentinian history.<ref name="rock.com.ar"/> The album, eventually released near the end of 1992, is stylistically a [[shoegazing]] album, and was met with alienation and shock from many fans of the band, who found its radical shift in style from ''Canción Animal'' discomforting and challenging to cope with. Surrounding the band's rushed decision to change record companies from [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] to [[Sony Music|Sony]] immediately before the disc's release, ''Dynamo'' failed to sell as expected, and remains the lowest-selling album of Soda's career today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dynamo-mw0000102326|title=Dynamo - Soda Stereo - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic}}</ref> 
Despite these challenges, Soda began their sixth tour of Latin America to begin 1993, during which time Cerati officially kickstarted his solo career with the release of ''[[Amor Amarillo]]'', his debut album.

====Challenges and eventual musical hiatus (1994)====
1994 met with fresh challenges to the band and its stability. On 4 July 1994, Zeta Bosio's young son was killed in a freak transit accident in Argentina. This event would deeply affect Zeta on both a personal and professional level, and surrounding his inability to work and growing dysfunction within the band, Soda unanimously decided to take a hiatus to possibly mediate the decision of separating permanently.

During this hiatus, the band's members would explore other personal endeavors. Cerati explored his solo career, Zeta dedicating himself to the production of other bands (Peligrosos Gorriones and Aguirre), while Alberti disappeared from the music scene to focus on personal projects.

At the end of 1994 ''[[Zona de Promesas]]'', a compilation of remixes and classic Soda songs, including the unreleased song that gave the album its name, was released.

===''Sueño Stereo'' (1995-1997) ===
1995 saw the release of ''[[Sueño Stereo]]'', the last of Soda's seven studio albums. The cover depicts three speaker cones (meant to symbolize [[egg cells]]) ready to be "fertilized" by black spermatozoa, the latter of which resembles earbuds. This motif is symbolic of the album's concept, and is even used as a focal point in the music video for "[[Ella usó mi cabeza como un revólver]]", a single from the recording.<ref name="SStereo">{{cite web |url=http://www.coveralia.com/caratulas/Soda-Stereo-Sueno-Stereo-Frontal.php |title=Tapa De Sueño Stereo |language= es |publisher=Coveralia |access-date=10 December 2007 }}</ref>

After a three-year absence, on 29 June 1995, Soda released ''Sueño Stereo'', their 7th and final studio album. The album was an instant hit, quickly reaching [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] status in Argentina 15 days after its release.<ref name="sslabanda">{{cite web | url = http://www.sodastereo.com/labanda/index.html | title = La banda | access-date = 4 January 2007 | work = Soda Stereo official website | language = es | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060424034444/http://www.sodastereo.com/labanda/index.html | archive-date = 24 April 2006 }}</ref> The album was powered by the radio hit "Zoom" and the promotional video for "Ella usó mi cabeza como un revólver", which in 1996 won the Viewer's Choice Award presented by [[MTV]] Latin America.

According to Cerati, the album was retroactively a source of pride for him and his band:

<blockquote>Sueño Stereo took two years to conceive. It would be illogical to say that this was [our] masterpiece, but it was the most emotional work [we had done] at the time, because we were stripped of the need of having competition in the future, or of being the best for another ten years. We had already made it through a lot of things and the band itself felt classic. On the other hand, we were very proud of what ''Dynamo'' had promoted and [how it was subsequently interpreted]... The band had to deliver something important; it couldn't just be "any" record. [We had] to find ourselves again after a while and allow the music to flow, without thinking too much about taking huge steps or anything like that. All-in-all, Sueño Stereo is one of the most innovative records of our career, without us trying to make it so - because of its sonic combinations, its lyrics, and because of its sound.<ref name="pepsi"/></blockquote>

The record became the catalyst for the extensive Gira Sueño Stereo (Sueño Stereo Tour), which began on 8 September in Buenos Aires, at the Grand Rex Theater{{spaced ndash}}it spanned Venezuela, Colombia, [[Perú]], [[Panama]], [[México]] and the United States (Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Miami). The tour ended on 24 April 1996 at the Teatro Teletón in [[Santiago de Chile]].

In mid 1996 Soda was invited to Miami by [[MTV]] to record a session for their acoustic show, ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. Soda, initially reluctant to play, was finally able to negotiate with the network to play with a unique setup: the band would play "plugged in", but with modifications such as heavy orchestration, including brand-new arrangements of some of their classic songs. The result was an eclectic mix of music, an acoustic-electric hybrid. A highlight of the album was a soaring rendition of "En La Ciudad De La Furia", where the chorus was sung by [[Andrea Echeverri]] of the Colombian [[Rock en Español]] band [[Aterciopelados]]. Other songs recorded included "Un Misil en Mi Placard" (re-arranged in a style that directly plagiarised the 1992 track ''Chrome Waves'' by English band [[Ride (band)|Ride]]), "Entre Canibales", "[[Cuando pase el temblor]]", "Té Para Tres","Angel Electrico", "Terapia de Amor Intensiva", "Disco Eterno", "[[Ella usó mi cabeza como un revólver]]", "Paseando Por Roma" and "Génesis" (a cover of [[Vox Dei (band)|Vox Dei]]). The recording of the [[MTV]] show would be partially released on the album ''[[Comfort y Música Para Volar]]'' in 1996, and in its entirety in a new version of ''Comfort'' released in 2007. The album contained 4 new tracks from the ''Sueño Stereo'' sessions, as well as an interactive [[CD-ROM]] with pictures and videos from the show.

On 30 October 1996 Soda Stereo became the first Latin American band to transmit a live concert via the [[Internet]], through the Argentine radio program ''Cuál Es?'' (Which Is It?). The show was conducted by [[Mario Pergolini]] on Argentina Rock & Pop radio. The band played live from the music store Promúsica in Buenos Aires.<ref name="Rock.mx">{{cite web|url=http://www.rock.com.mx/soda_01_07.html |title=A Una Década De Su Despedida Los Veremos Volver |language=es |access-date=10 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222003508/http://www.rock.com.mx/soda_01_07.html |archive-date=22 December 2007  }}</ref>

=== Band breakup and El Último Concierto (1997) ===
Times were silent preceding the separation of the band, except for the band's participation on the tribute album, ''Tributo a Queen: Los Grandes del Rock en Español'', in which Soda covered "[[Some Day One Day]]" from [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s 1974 album, ''[[Queen II]]'', and sung it in Spanish, as "Algun Día".

Unexpectedly, Soda officially announced their separation in May 1997, through a press release. The following day, Argentinian newspapers echoed the news, in the case of Argentine newspaper [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|''Clarín'']] devoting an entire front page entirely to the breakup. The following day, Gustavo Cerati's farewell note was published on the Music section of the newspaper. The farewell letter read:

<blockquote>[This letter has been] inspired from what I have seen on the street these days: fans who have approached me, the people around me, and from my own personal experiences. I share the sadness that has been created in many by our separation. I, myself, am immersed in that state because few things have been so important to me in my life as Soda Stereo. Everyone knows that it is impossible to lead a band without a certain level of conflict. It is a fragile equilibrium in the war of ideas that very few are able to handle for fifteen years, as we proudly did [and maintained]. But, ultimately, different personal and musical misunderstandings began to compromise that equilibrium... excuses were generated for not confronting ourselves, excuses for a future group that we no longer believed in as we did in the past. To end for the sake of the band is, in its redundancy, to [give importance] to our mental health, and above all to show respect for all of our fans who have followed us for such a long time. Goodbye.<ref name="letter">{{cite web

The band would carry on with a farewell tour, making stops in Mexico, Venezuela, Chile and their native Argentina. Their final concert took place on 20 September at the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]] in Buenos Aires, and was recorded and released in two parts, ''[[El Último Concierto]]'' A and B.<ref name="nacion">{{cite news | url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/77304 | title = Tomátelo con Soda | access-date = 7 February 2007 | date = 22 September 1997 | work = [[La Nación]] | language = es | first = Adriana | last = Franco}}</ref> The show ended with the song "De Musica Ligera" and a memorable farewell by Cerati:

<blockquote>"{{small|(Original, [[Spanish language|Spanish]])}} ¡No solo no hubiéramos sido nada sin ustedes, sino con toda la gente que estuvo a nuestro alrededor desde el comienzo; algunos siguen hasta hoy! ¡Gracias... '''''totales!'''''"</blockquote><ref name="YouTube.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Sv-2ytWoM |title=Gracias Totales|author= Cerati, Gustavo | language = es|publisher=Youtube.com |access-date=3 September 2017}} {{unreliable?|date=September 2017}}</ref>

<blockquote>{{small|([[English language|English]] translation)}} "[We would not have] been anything without [you all], but [also] without everyone that supported us since the very beginning; some still do till this day! A huge... '''''thank you!'''''"</blockquote>

A DVD of the farewell show was released in 2005. A compilation CD was released later that year titled ''{{illm|Chau Soda|es|Chau Soda}}'' ("Bye Soda").

===Post Soda===
Despite the constant rumors of a reunion, which ironically started shortly after the breakup, little was heard regarding Soda, except for a TV special on ''El Ultimo Concierto'' (The Last Concert) produced by HBO and an MTV documentary titled ''Soda Stereo: La Leyenda'' (Soda Stereo: The Legend). Finally, in 2002 the trio was reunited at the [[Los Premios MTV Latinoamérica|MTV Latin Music Video Awards]] where they were awarded the Legend award in honor of their musical and visual trajectory.

Seven years after the breakup and the absence of any new official releases seemed odd. Near the end of 2003 [[Sony Music]] announced the release of the first DVD by Soda Stereo, which contained much unreleased material from compiled by Gustavo, Zeta, Charly, and people close to the band. The finished product arrived on the streets in November 2004. It was titled, ''Soda Stereo: Una Parte de La Euforia (1983–1997)'' (Soda Stereo: A Part of the Euphoria (1983–1997)). On 20 September 2005 an Argentine DVD of Soda's last concert, which took place exactly 8 years before at River Plate stadium was released. It was titled ''El Ultimo Concierto (En Vivo)'' (The Last Concert – Live). The [[DVD]], in contrast to the [[HBO]] production, featured a 5.1 audio and included two songs that were not aired on the HBO concert, "Juegos de Seduccion" and "Sobredosis de TV". It also included a multi camera option for a soundcheck of "Primavera 0" and a 25-minute documentary about the tour featuring footage of sound checks and concerts in Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina. It also featured an interview with the long lost "fourth Soda" {{illm|Alfredo Lois|es|Alfredo Lois}}, the director of the DVD, one of his last works before his death.

===''Me Verás Volver'' (2007) ===
[[File:Entradasoda.jpg|thumb|[[Gira Me Verás Volver|«Me verás Volver»]]. Ticket for the [[Bogotá]] (Colombia) show. Soda Stereo reunited one million fans during their 2007 reunion tour.]]

The reunification of Soda stereo was a mandatory topic for journalists whenever faced with a former member. So much so, that Zeta Bosio once declared:

"One day I dreamed that I was not going to be asked about a Soda reunion!"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/18/espectaculos/c-01365463.htm |title= Zeta Bosio: No Encontré Nuevos Socios |date=18 February 2007 | language = es|publisher=Clarín |access-date=20 December 2007 }}</ref>

In 2007, ten years after their breakup, the band decided to reunite for a one-time-only tour of Latin America. On 6 June 2007, the official news came out: Soda Stereo would return to the stage with a sole American tour called ''Me Veras Volver'' (You Will See My Return), an emblematic line from "En La Ciudad de la Furia".

In early July, Sony/BMG released a new compilation album titled ''Me Verás Volver (Hits & +)''. The album contained 18 remastered studio recordings and lacked of new material, but it did contain a code to access exclusive web footage such as live versions. The album reached number one in Argentina and Chile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/entretenimiento/musica_y_conciertos/103476_1.php |title=Soda Stereo Regresa a Lista de Discos Más Vendidos de América Latina |date=8 November 2007 |language=es |publisher=RPP Noticias |access-date=12 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212000321/http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/entretenimiento/musica_y_conciertos/103476_1.php |archive-date=12 December 2007  }}</ref>

On 20 September 2007, exactly 10 years since their last concert, Soda Stereo gave a long-awaited press conference at the Club Museum in Buenos Aires, in a historical building designed at the turn of the century by the famous French architect and structural engineer [[Gustave Eiffel]]. This building had been used, years before, as the location for their music video for "En La Ciudad De La Furia".<ref name="holas totales">{{cite web |url= http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/07/09/22/secciones/espectaculos/nota.asp?nota_id=117057 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20121230063936/http://www2.lavoz.com.ar/07/09/22/secciones/espectaculos/nota.asp?nota_id=117057 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 30 December 2012 |title= Holas Totales |author= Arrascaeta, Germán |date= 22 September 2007 |language= es |publisher= La Voz del Interior |access-date= 11 December 2007 }}</ref><ref name="Club Museum">{{cite web|url=http://www.clubmuseum.com.ar/disco.php |title=Club Museum |work=Sitio Oficial del Club Museum |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228212436/http://www.clubmuseum.com.ar/disco.php |archive-date=28 February 2009 }}</ref> They surprised the attendance with a mini concert of two songs, "Sobredosis de TV" and "En La Ciudad de La Furia", played in their original format, performed solely by the trio. During the press conference, they clarified that after the tour they intended on resuming their individual pursuits.

[[File:Soda Santiago 1.JPG|thumb|left|"You Will See Me Return". A picture of the show at the {{illm|Julio Martínez Stadium|es|Estadio Nacional de Chile}} in Santiago, Chile on 24 October 2007.]]

The tour was scheduled to begin on 19 October at [[Estadio Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]] in Buenos Aires, and originally only two concerts were scheduled as well as performances in several Latin American countries. However, from the time the tickets went on sale it became apparent that it wouldn't be enough, and that the band was faced with a huge continent-wide cultural event. Over 90,000 tickets were sold in only 24 hours. The band quickly added another show to the schedule,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sodastereo.com/noticias/record_historico.php | title = Récord Histórico | date = 13 June 2007 | access-date = 10 June 2007 | work = Soda Stereo official website | language = es |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808011746/http://sodastereo.com/noticias/record_historico.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 8 August 2007}}</ref> which sold out in 3 days, so 2 more dates were added.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sodastereo.com/noticias/nuevas_funciones.php | title = Nuevas Funciones | date = 15 June 2007 | access-date = 10 June 2007 | work = Soda Stereo official website | language = es |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626013228/http://sodastereo.com/noticias/nuevas_funciones.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 26 June 2007}}</ref>

Finally on 19 October 2007, the time came for the triumphant return of Soda Stereo at the [[Estadio Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]] in Argentina. A massive banner that contained a large sentence with the name of their songs intertwined was unveiled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universo.cl/prontus_universo/site/artic/20071020/pags/20071020233904.html |title=Diez años después… fue un temblor en la ciudad de la furia |author=Costas, Carlos |date=20 September 2007 |language=es |publisher=Radio Universo |access-date=20 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226022434/http://www.universo.cl/prontus_universo/site/artic/20071020/pags/20071020233904.html |archive-date=26 December 2007  }}</ref>

The band was accompanied by one of the main "fourth Soda's" [[Tweety Gonzalez]] (keyboards), as well as [[Leandro Fresco]] (keyboards, percussion, and backing vocals), and Leo Garcia on guitars and backing vocals. The concert lasted more than three hours. Soda played a total of 28 songs. The show opened with a recording of "Algun Dia" their cover of [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] "Someday One Day" meanwhile images of the history of Soda Stereo appeared in the background.

The expected number of fans attending the five shows was more than 300,000, making Soda Stereo one of the most watched public events in the history of Argentina. Soda became the only band to play more than five times in the Estadio Monumental in Argentina in a single tour. Me Verás Volver featured 22 concerts throughout America including three shows in the US -all but two were sold out[42].
