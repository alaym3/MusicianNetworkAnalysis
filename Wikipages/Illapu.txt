'''Illapu''' are a Chilean [[folk music|folk]] and andean musical ensemble that was  formed in 1971 in [[Antofagasta]], in northern [[Chile]], by the brothers José Miguel, Jaime, Andrés and Roberto Márquez Bugueño. A later addition to the group was Osvaldo Torres.

== Story ==
Illapu was formed in 1971 in the northern Chilean city of [[Antofagasta]]. Their name comes from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] word meaning "Lightning Bolt". That same year they performed in the ''Festival del Salitre'' ("Saltpeter Festival") in María Elena (a mining precinct) and won the festival's prize after performing [[Quilapayún]]'s "La Muralla". They were sharply criticized by the organiser of the musical event, [[Patricio Manns]], for interpreting someone else's composition. That same year Pato Valdivia joined the ensemble.

In 1972 they moved to [[Santiago de Chile]] seeking more performance and recording opportunities. They recorded their first album, ''Música Andina'', for the label DICAP. Shortly afterwards they won a prize at the ''Norte Andino Festival'' ("Andean North Festival") in [[Calama, Chile|Calama]] interpreting "Dale Mañungo", composed by the songwriter Nano Acevedo.

In 1973 they performed for the first time at the prestigious ''Festival Internacional de la Canción de [[Viña del Mar]]'' music festival. Their novel musical approach and [[aesthetics]] on stage gained them the recognition from music critics and praise from the general public. At this stage they began to be considered a new element in the ''Nueva Canción Chilena'' ("New Chilean Song") movement. The resources allocated to the arts and culture under the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]] government of [[Salvador Allende]] also allowed Illapu to fully develop their artistic potential.

In 1981, because of the repression under the [[Pinochet]] regime, they were forced into exile - going first to France and later Mexico City. In 1988, due to the improved political climate, they returned to Chile. Their 1993 album ''En Estos Días'', which contained the hit single "Lejos del Amor", won 7 platinum records.
