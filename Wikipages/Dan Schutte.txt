==Biography==
Schutte was born in Neenah, Wisconsin, on December 28, 1947, grew up in [[Elm Grove, Wisconsin]], and graduated from [[Marquette University High School]] before entering the [[Society of Jesus]].

He was one of the founding members of the [[St. Louis Jesuits]] who popularized a contemporary style of [[church music]] set to sacred texts sung in English as a result of the liturgical reforms initiated by the [[Second Vatican Council]].

He released nine collections with the [[St. Louis Jesuits]] and a 30-year anniversary collection in 2005. Their second recording, ''Earthen Vessels'' sold over one million albums,<ref>"The St. Louis Jesuits: Thirty Years" [[Oregon Catholic Press|OCP]] 2006 archives</ref> and as a result, beginning with hymnals such as ''[[Glory and Praise]]'', their music became standard repertoire in Catholic parishes across the country.  Other members of the St. Louis Jesuits are [[Bob Dufford]], [[Roc O'Connor]], [[John Foley (Jesuit)|John Foley]] and [[Tim Manion]]. He left the Society of Jesus in 1986.<ref>"The St. Louis Jesuits: Thirty Years" [[Oregon Catholic Press|OCP]] 2006 page 131</ref>

His compositions are primarily written for Catholic [[liturgy|liturgical]] use, but, over time, have found their way into Protestant worship. Some of the more notable include "City of God" (1981), "Only This I Want" (1981), "Blest Be the Lord" (1976), "You Are Near" (1971), "Though the Mountains May Fall" (1975), "Sing a New Song" (1972), "Glory and Praise to Our God" (1976), "Here I Am, Lord" (1981), "Table of Plenty" (1992), "River of Glory" (2001), and "[[These Alone Are Enough]]" (2004), his setting of the Ignatian [[Suscipe]] prayer.

"The St. Louis Jesuit Mass" (1973), co-authored during his collaborative years, was the most-used Mass setting in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. With the implementation of the Roman Missal, Third Edition in 2012, it was decided not to revise it. Schutte's composition of "Mass of God's Promise" (1996, revised 2010) continues to have wide use. "Mass of Christ the Savior," released in 2012, quickly became one of the most widely used Mass Settings throughout the English speaking world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icelweb.org/copyright.htm|title=Welcome to ICEL|website=www.icelweb.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocp.org/en-us/mass-settings|title=Find popular Mass settings for the Catholic liturgy|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref><ref>https://www.licensingonline.org/en-us</ref>
        
Many notable Christian artists such as [[Chris Christian]], [[Amy Grant]] and [[John Michael Talbot]] have recorded his compositions.

In 2006, he wrote the component of a major catechetical program for teachers on the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola]] and the use of music in prayer.  In 2009, Twenty – Third Publications released a new book ''Walking the Sacred Path – Spiritual Exercises for Today''.

In 2012, he wrote "God With Us - A Prayer Book For Advent and Christmas."

In 2014, he wrote, "From Ashes To Glory - A Prayer Book For Lent and Easter."

He continues to compose new music, write about spirituality and is an in-demand presenter on liturgy, and the role of music as sung prayer.

In addition to his Jesuit formation, Schutte holds two master of arts degrees, one in theology and one in liturgy from [[The Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley]].<ref name="ocp.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.ocp.org/artists/352|title=Dan Schutte - Artists - OCP|website=www.ocp.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref> Schutte is also an alumnus of [[St. Louis University]] and [[Seattle University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocp.org/artists/352#tab:awards|title=Dan Schutte - Artists - OCP|website=www.ocp.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref> He did graduate studies in music composition under the direction of Fr.

==His music in contemporary Catholic culture==
<!-- NOTE TO FUTURE EDITORS:  Please don't fill this article with arguments for or against contemporary music in the liturgy!  That topic belongs on the "Contemporary Catholic liturgical music" page, not on the page of an individual composer. -->

A 2017 poll conducted by the [[National Association of Pastoral Musicians]] found among members that Dan Schutte's hymn ''[[Here I Am, Lord]]'' placed second among "songs that make a difference".<ref>https://npm.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/PM%20Vol%2031-6.pdf page 29</ref>

In a circular of 29 July 2008, the [[Congregation for Divine Worship]] directed that, "in liturgical celebrations, in songs and prayers the name of God in the form of the [[tetragrammaton]] [[YHWH]] is neither to be used or pronounced".<ref>[http://www.bible-researcher.com/dominus.html Letter to the Bishops Conferences on The Name of God]</ref> Schutte himself agreed with the directive.<ref>[https://catholicsensibility.wordpress.com/2008/08/14/you-are-near/ Catholic Sensibility: You Are Near]</ref> Accordingly, for Catholic liturgical services the refrain of  Schutte's "You Are Near", which began as "Yahweh, I know you are near" now begins with "O Lord, I know you are near".<ref>[https://www.topcatholicsongs.com/you-are-near-schutte Top Catholic Songs: You Are Near]</ref><ref>[http://ocpvn.org/english-corner/you-are-near-dan-schutte.html You Are Near]</ref><ref>[http://church-of-the-visitation.org/images/Mass_History_and_Meaning_Merged.pdf Exploring the History and Meaning in Our Liturgies, page 19 of 23]</ref>
