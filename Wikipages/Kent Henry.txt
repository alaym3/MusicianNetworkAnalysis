'''Kent Henry Plischke''' (April 5, 1948 – March 18, 2009), known as '''Kent Henry''', was an American guitarist and songwriter best known for his contributions to [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] and [[Blues Image]].<ref name = Henryobit>Uncredited, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/kent-henry-guitarist-with-steppenwolf-and-blues-image-1657169.html Kent Henry: Guitarist with Steppenwolf and Blues Image]; Obituary, ''[[The Independent]]'', March 30, 2009; ''The Independent''.</ref>

==Blues Image==

Henry joined Blues Image during the sessions for ''[[Open (Blues Image album)|Open]]'' after [[Mike Pinera]] agreed to join [[Iron Butterfly]].  His significant contributions to that album, although uncredited, included the tasteful clean solo and fills on "[[Ride Captain Ride]]."  Mike Pinera plays the distorted solo at the end of the song.  After recording ''Red, White, and Blues Image'', producer [[Richard Podolor]] suggested to Steppenwolf that Henry would be a good replacement for departed guitarist [[Larry Byrom]].

==Steppenwolf==

Henry recorded ''[[For Ladies Only]]'' and toured with the band on their farewell tour, in addition to his contributions on [[John Kay (musician)|John Kay's]] first solo album, ''Forgotten Songs and Unsung Heroes''.  Henry was not invited to rejoin the band when it reformed to record ''[[Slow Flux]]'' and found out about it when new guitarist [[Bobby Cochran]] called him for advice, believing it was Henry's choice to not be a part of Steppenwolf.  [[Goldy McJohn]], the band's keyboardist at the time, says Henry was fired because he didn't get along well with drummer [[Jerry Edmonton]].

Henry remained on good terms with McJohn, and played with McJohn in 1977, 1978 and 1980 versions of Steppenwolf led by McJohn, but without lead singer [[John Kay (musician)|John Kay]].<ref>See [[List of Steppenwolf members]].  See also "New Steppenwolf" section of [[Steppenwolf (band)]].</ref>  At the time of Henry's death, he was planning to rejoin McJohn as part of "Goldy McJohn and Friendz", a band that McJohn had formed to play Steppenwolf songs, following the announcement that John Kay and Steppenwolf planned to substantially cease touring.<ref>[http://gmandfriendz.com/ Band membership of Goldy McJohn and Friendz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412052403/http://www.gmandfriendz.com/ |date=April 12, 2009 }}; www.gmandfriendz.com.</ref><ref>See John Kay comments in relation to concerts in 2009, "...play(ing) a handful, say maybe a dozen or so, dates this summer, not touring mind you, (we're done with that), but a few concerts would be fun."

==Later years==

Henry settled in Portland, Oregon, as of the early 1980s, and would remain there for the balance of his life.  He played in local bands (principally the [[Paul deLay]] Blues Band) and worked primarily as a guitar technician.<ref name = Oregonbio/>

During his later years, Henry encountered increasing difficulties with seizures, which had originally appeared following a fall off the stage of the [[Whisky A Go Go]]. He also developed the early stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]] shortly before his death.  As a consequence of these challenges and given that care by family members was unavailable to him, Henry was under the constant care of friends, from 2005 until his death.<ref>Henry was estranged from his spouse, with his children apparently unable to care for him.  His parents were deceased and his only sibling lived across the country from Portland, in Boston.  See Mike and Candice Parker, [http://www.imorial.com/kenthenry/ Biography of Kent Henry]; Kent Henry Online Memorial, www.imorial.com.</ref>  He died due to lack of bowel movement.  Henry was taken to the hospital by his caregiver and died  on the operating table.<ref name = Oregonbio>Michael Russell, [http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/03/local_blues_musician_dies.html Local blues musician dies].
