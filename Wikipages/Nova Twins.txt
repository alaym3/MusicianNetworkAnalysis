==Career==
Love and South have been close friends since childhood and have played in bands that were often booked on the same bill. They formed a band together in 2014 named BRAATS, releasing the song "Bad Bitches" under that name. Later that year they settled on the name Nova Twins, and released their first song under that name, "Bassline Bitch", in April 2015.<ref name="whenthehornblows.com 2018-08-21">{{cite web|url=https://whenthehornblows.com/content/2018/8/21/interview-nova-twins-the-lexington |title=Interview: Nova Twins - The Lexington |website=When The Horn Blows |date=2018-08-21 |accessdate=2020-06-04}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://schonmagazine.com/interview-nova-twins/|title=interview &#124; nova twins|website=Schonmagazine.com|accessdate=2020-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rightchordmusic.co.uk/nova-twins-bassline-btch/|title=Nova Twins.
