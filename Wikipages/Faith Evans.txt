==Biography==

===1973–1994: Early life and career beginnings===
Evans was born on June 10, 1973, in [[Lakeland, Florida]], to an [[African American]] mother, Helene Evans, a professional singer.<ref name="one">{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Gaby|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/jul/10/popandrock|date=July 10, 2005|title=Rap's first lady|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=March 14, 2009}}</ref> Her father, Richard Swain, was a musician of [[English people|English]] and potential [[Italians|Italian]] descent who left before Evans was born (Evans has said "I've heard people mumble something about him being [[Swain (surname)|Italian, but I don't know for sure]]").<ref name="bookbio1">{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Faith|author2=Aliya S.

Faith had known Johnnie Mae and Orvelt Kennedy as her grandparents.<ref name="one"/><ref name="three">{{cite web|last=Waldron|first=Clarence|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_24_96/ai_57800104/pg_2|date=November 15, 1999|title=Faith Evans Tells How She Balances Motherhood and Music|work=[[Jet Magazine]]|access-date=March 15, 2009}}</ref> It was not until a couple of years later that Helene's career floundered and she tried to take Evans back home. Faith, however, was afraid to leave what she had "been used to," and instead, Helene relocated next door.<ref name="one"/>

Raised in a Christian home, Evans began singing at church at age two. At age four, she caught the attention of the congregation of the Emmanuel Baptist Church in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] when she sang [[The 5th Dimension]]'s song "[[Let the Sunshine In]]".<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1264/is_n8_v28/ai_20039489/pg_2] {{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref> While attending [[University High School (New Jersey)|University High School]] in Newark, she sang with several [[jazz music|jazz bands]] and, encouraged by Helene, entered outside pageants, festivals and contests, where her voice would be noticed and praised. After graduating from high school in 1991, Evans attended [[Fordham University]] in New York City to study marketing but left a year later to have daughter Chyna with music producer Kiyamma Griffin.<ref name="two"/> In 1993, she relocated to Los Angeles, where she worked as a [[backing vocalist|backup vocalist]] for singer [[Al B. Sure!]], when she was noticed by musician [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs]]. Impressed with her, Combs contracted her as the first female artist to his [[Bad Boy Entertainment]] record label during 1994.<ref name="two">{{cite web|last=Helligar|first=Jeremy|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20126796,00.html|date=November 16, 1998|title=Mrs. B.I.G.|work=[[People Magazine]]|access-date=March 14, 2009}}</ref>

===1994–2001: ''Faith'', ''Keep The Faith'', Biggie, motherhood and marriage===
Newly contracted to [[Bad Boy Records]], Evans was consulted by executive producer Combs to contribute backing vocals and writing skills to [[Mary J. Blige]]'s ''[[My Life (Mary J. Blige album)|My Life]]'' (1994) and [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher's]] [[Usher (album)|self-titled debut album]] (1994) prior to starting work on her debut studio album ''[[Faith (Faith Evans album)|Faith]]''.<ref name="four">{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/evans_faith/artist.jhtml#bio|date=November 16, 2006|title=Full Biography|publisher=MTV|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=March 20, 2009}}</ref> Released on August 29, 1995, in North America, the album was a main collaboration with Bad Boy's main producers, [[The Hitmen (production team)|The Hitmen]], including [[Chucky Thompson]] and Combs, but it also resulted in recordings with [[Poke & Tone]] and Herb Middleton. ''Faith'' became a success based on the singles "[[You Used to Love Me (Faith Evans song)|You Used to Love Me]]" and "[[Soon as I Get Home]]". The album was eventually certified [[Platinum album|platinum]] with 1.5 million copies sold, according to [[RIAA]].<ref name="five">{{cite web|last=Smaldino|first=Denise|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117984917.html?categoryid=3067&cs=1|date=April 30, 2008|title=Sean Combs earns platinum, gold|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=March 20, 2009}}</ref>

A year before, on August 4, 1994, Evans married rapper and label mate [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Christopher "The Notorious B.I.G." Wallace]], after having met him at a Bad Boy photoshoot.<ref name="chappell"/> The couple had one child together, [[Christopher Wallace Jr.|Christopher George Latore Wallace Jr.]].

Evans became involved in the [[East Coast&ndash;West Coast hip hop rivalry]] which dominated the [[rap music]] news at the time after allegations of an affair with [[Tupac Shakur]]. Wallace was murdered in a yet-to-be-solved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles, California in March 1997.<ref name="three"/> During early 1997, after her separation from Wallace, but before his death, Evans' friend [[Missy Elliott]] introduced her to record company executive Todd Russaw. Faith began dating Russaw during her and Wallace's separation and after Wallace died, Evans became pregnant by Russaw. The couple had their first son Joshua on June 10, 1998 (her 25th birthday).<ref name="chappell"/> During the summer of 1998, Evans and Russaw were married, and on March 22, 2007, they had their second son Ryder Evan Russaw.<ref name="chappell"/>

After Biggie's murder on March 9, 1997, Combs helped Evans produce her tribute song named "[[I'll Be Missing You]]", [[sampling (music)|based]] on the [[melody]] of [[The Police]]'s 1983 single "[[Every Breath You Take]]". The song, which featured Combs, Evans, and the all-male group [[112 (band)|112]], became a worldwide number-one success and debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart during 1997, scoring that for eleven weeks. It eventually won Puffy,Evans, and 112 the 1998 [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]].<ref name="one"/> The next year, she received another two Grammy nominations for "[[Heartbreak Hotel (Whitney Houston song)|Heartbreak Hotel]]", a collaboration with singers [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Kelly Price]], that scored number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.<ref name="sic">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_24_96/ai_57800104/|title=Faith Evans Tells How She Balances Motherhood And Music|last=Waldron|first=Clarence|date=November 15, 1999|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|publisher=FindArticles.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713070330/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_24_96/ai_57800104/|archive-date=2012-07-13|access-date=January 25, 2010}}</ref>

Two years in the making, Evans' second studio album, ''[[Keep the Faith (Faith Evans album)|Keep the Faith]]'', was released in October 1998. Almost entirely written and produced by her, Evans considered the album difficult to complete as she had initially felt discouraged about the progress at first.<ref name="chappell"/> Upon its release, however, the album earned generally positive reviews by music critics, with [[Allmusic]] noting it "without a doubt a highlight of 1990s soul-pop music".<ref>{{cite web|first=Jose F.|last=Promis|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r380162|pure_url=yes}}|date=April 30, 2008|title=''Keep the Faith'' review|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Also enjoying commercial success, it eventually went platinum and produced the top ten singles "[[Love Like This (Faith Evans song)|Love Like This]]" and "All Night Long" (released March 30, 1999) prompting Evans to start an 18-city theater tour with [[Dru Hill]] and [[Total (band)|Total]] the following year.<ref name="chappell"/>

===2001–2007: ''Faithfully'', legal issues, Capitol Records and ''The First Lady''===

Evans' third album on the Bad Boy label, named ''[[Faithfully (Faith Evans album)|Faithfully]]'' (2001), involved her working with a wider range of producers, including [[The Neptunes]], [[Mario Winans]], [[Buckwild]], [[Vada Nobles]], [[Cory Rooney]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_22_100/ai_80162956/|title=Singer Faith Evans sheds more than 50 lbs; releases new CD, ''Faithfully''|date=November 12, 2001|work=Jet|publisher=FindArticles.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901085215/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_22_100/ai_80162956/|archive-date=2009-09-01|access-date=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Her first project with husband Todd Russaw as executive producer and creative partner, the album scored number 14 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart and number two on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, eventually being certified platinum, but yielded moderately successful singles, with the [[Jennifer Lopez]]-written "[[I Love You (Faith Evans song)|I Love You]]" becoming the only top twenty entry.<ref>{{cite web|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1448788/20010910/evans_faith.jhtml|date=October 9, 2001|title=Faith Evans Flips Biggie, Studies Ella Fitzgerald For ''Faithfully''|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[VH1]].com|access-date=January 24, 2010}}</ref> Released amid Bad Boy Records' transition from distributor [[Arista Records]] to [[Universal Records|Universal]], Evans felt ''Faithfully'' received minimum assistance by the company, and during 2004, she finally decided to end her business with Bad Boy as she was convinced Combs couldn't improve her career any more due to his other commitments.<ref name="dan">{{cite web|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1499639/20050405/evans_faith.jhtml|date=October 23, 2001|title=Faith Evans Talks About Her Drug Arrest on New Single|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[VH1]].com|access-date=April 5, 2010}}</ref>

And since I am always linked to Big, there are a lot of misconceptions about who I really am. It's not easy putting your life out there for the masses. But I've decided I'll tell my own story. For Big. For my children. And for myself."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Keep-The-Faith/Faith-Evans/e/9780446199506 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 16, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021072427/http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Keep-The-Faith/Faith-Evans/e/9780446199506 |archive-date=October 21, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote> In its initial release, ''Keep the Faith: A Memoir'' landed in the Top 20 on New York's Best Seller's List two consecutive weeks in a row.
