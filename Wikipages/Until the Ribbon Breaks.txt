'''Until the Ribbon Breaks''' is a British band consisting of the frontman Pete Lawrie-Winfield (lead vocals, keyboards, programming, percussion, brass, guitar) and Elliot Wall (drums, programming, backing vocals). Sometimes abbreviated to '''UTRB,''' the band was founded in [[Cardiff]], [[United Kingdom|Wales]] in 2012 initially as Lawrie-Winfield's solo project and "blends genres like electronic, pop, rock, and hip-hop, but it’s all done with a sharp alternative edge."<ref name="pigeonsplanes"/>

== History==

===2012: Founding===
The group began as the solo project of Pete Lawrie Winfield, from [[Cardiff]], [[United Kingdom|Wales]]. Both his parents were musicians, and Winfield grew up to listening to artists such as [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Elton John]]. Winfield went to school to study film, but found he preferred music after he started making soundtracks for his own movies.<ref name="nakiska"/> He has stated, "Until The Ribbon Breaks started as a concept I had for one record. Ribbon being film or a cassette tape as the whole thing was based around this idea of the combination of music and film. At the time I made it I didn't know how far I was going to go with it."<ref name="nakiska"/>

===2013: Early releases===

Stated [[Pitchfork Media]] on June 20, 2013, Until the Ribbon Breaks' early single "Pressure" "was written during a period when Winfield was sleeping on the floor of his studio with no concrete plan for his career."<ref name="pitchforkuntiltheirbbon"/><ref name="nprribbon"/> For the music video Winfield combined scenes from [[David Lynch]]'s 1997 thriller ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'', stating, "''Lost Highway'' seemed like the perfect match visually for the mood I was trying to convey...The film feels willfully claustrophobic and always on the verge of losing any sense of continuity."<ref name="nprribbon"/>

}}
With the track "2025," released in June 2013, ''Pitchfork'' writes that Winfield "manages to paint a starkly provocative picture of emotional decay, exhaling his vocals with a painfully resigned rasp circled by lurching drum machines, deflating synths, and industrial clanging. '2025' is a beautiful dirge, a bleak track kept barely afloat by an aching, human sadness."<ref name="pitchforkuntiltheirbbon"/>

Winfield soon recruited James Gordon and Elliot Wall to join the band. To create their debut album, the band "buried themselves in a hidden studio space armed with just a film projector, a microphone, a drum machine, and a piano."<ref name="windisha"/> The band would project films without sound on the studio walls while working, with Winfield stating "I’d shut the sound off, watch the movies, and make music to them. It was everything from [[David Lynch]] to [[Terrence Malick]].”<ref name="windisha"/>

The band finished their first tour of North America in 2013 in support of [[Lorde]], and also finished a five-date tour across the United States with [[Phantogram (band)|Phantogram]] that year.<ref name="windisha"/> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' named the Until The Ribbon Breaks one of the Best 5 Artist of the Month for June 2013.<ref name="spinbest"/> As of 2013 they have released remixes of [[The Weeknd]]'s "[[Wicked Games]]," [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]'s "[[Nirvana (Sam Smith EP)|Nirvana]]," and [[Lorde]]'s "[[Royals (song)|Royals]]."<ref name="windisha"/> UTRB was featured on [[Run the Jewels]]' "Job Well Done" in 2013.<ref name="pigeonsplanes"/>

===2014: Recent projects===

In 2014 the band also released a remix of "[[Sights (song)|Sights]]" by [[London Grammar]], also releasing a music video for the remix composed of cut up clips from films that inspired the re-imagination. ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' called the remix "a starker, slimmer version of the original that transforms the spirit of it into something slightly more eerie."<ref name="vogueuntil"/> In June 2014 the band performed at [[Electric Forest Festival]] in Michigan.<ref name="ef-2014"/> The band will open for [[London Grammar]] throughout January 2015,<ref name="vogueuntil"/> after releasing their debut full-length album, ''A Lesson Unlearnt'', in January 2015.

On 3 November 2015, it was announced through the band's Facebook page that member James Gordon would be leaving the band to focus on new ventures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/untiltheribbonbreaks/photos/a.297964220288518.68545.241759269242347/884463158305285/?type=3&theater |title=Hello friends. Last night was James'... - Until The Ribbon Breaks |website=Facebook.com |date= |accessdate=2020-03-21}}</ref>

On 26 January 2018 the band was featured on a video by the YouTube social experiment channel 'Yes Theory' regarding past alcoholism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8gCHq_7rsQ |title=The Untold Story of a Rockstar |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2018-01-26 |accessdate=2020-03-21}}</ref> 
 
On 23 February 2018, Until the Ribbon Breaks released its second studio album called “Until the Ribbon Breaks.”

The band "blends genres like electronic, pop, rock, and hip-hop, but it’s all done with a sharp alternative edge,"<ref name="pigeonsplanes"/> and [[Pitchfork Media]] has called UTRB "avant-R&B savants."<ref name="pitchforkuntiltheirbbon"/> The band often writes music in front of a projector, with Winfield stating "For me, it just allows my mind to wander further than the confines of where it normally would. Silent moving images of nature, space, a busy street, whatever it maybe, take on a new sense of gravitas when soundtracked and vice versa. The music is given meaning by the image."<ref name="nprribbon"/> Winfield has also stated that, "Lyrics, to me, are the most essential part of writing music. I always start with the music, and depending on how I feel and what mood the music is conveying, that gives me an idea of what kind of thing I should be saying over it."<ref name="nakiska"/>
