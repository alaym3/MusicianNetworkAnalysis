'''Andrew Wegman Bird''' (born July 11, 1973) is an American [[indie rock]] multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter. Since 1996, he has released 16 studio albums, as well as several live albums and EPs, spanning various genres including [[swing music]], [[indie rock]], and [[folk music]]. He is primarily known for his unique style of violin playing, accompanied by [[Loop pedal|loop]] and effect pedals, whistling, and voice. In the 1990s, he sang and played violin in several jazz ensembles, including [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]] and Kevin O'Donnell's Quality Six. He went on to start his own swing ensemble, [[Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire]], which released three albums between 1998 and 2001. ''[[Weather Systems (Andrew Bird album)|Weather Systems]]'' (2003) was his first solo album, and a departure from jazz music into indie music. Bird's 2019 album ''[[My Finest Work Yet]]'' was nominated for "Best Folk Album" at the 2020 [[Grammy Award]]s.

Beyond his own record releases, he has collaborated with various artists, including [[The Handsome Family]], [[Dosh (musician)|Dosh]], [[Fiona Apple]], and [[Nora O'Connor]].

He has also had a career in film, as a soundtrack composer as well as an actor. He appeared as "Dr. Stringz" in a 2007 episode of [[Jack's Big Music Show]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0961772/ |title="Jack's Big Music Show" Jack's Big Oops!

}}</ref> Bird graduated from [[Lake Forest High School (Illinois)|Lake Forest High School]] in 1991 and [[Northwestern University]] with a [[bachelor's degree]] in violin performance in 1996. That same year he self-released his first solo album, ''[[Music of Hair]]''. Vastly different from his later work, this album showcased his violin skills and paid tribute to his fascination with both American and European [[folklore|folk]] traditions, as well as [[jazz]] and [[blues]]. Following this, his initial commercial exposure came through collaborative work with the band [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]], appearing on three of their albums (''[[Hot (Squirrel Nut Zippers album)|Hot]]'', ''[[Sold Out (Squirrel Nut Zippers album)|Sold Out]]'', and ''[[Perennial Favorites]]'') between 1996 and 1998.

Taking on the role of bandleader, Bird released ''[[Thrills (Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire album)|Thrills]]'' on Rykodisc in 1998 with his group [[Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire]], shortly followed by a second album ''[[Oh! The Grandeur]]'' in 1999. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz, and [[Swing (genre)|swing]], with Bird relying on the violin as his primary [[musical instrument]], as well as providing vocals along with his trademark verbose lyrics.  The Bowl of Fire featured musicians from Bird's hometown of Chicago, including Kevin O'Donnell, Joshua Hirsch, Jon Williams, [[Nora O'Connor]], Andy Hopkins, Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn, and Ryan Hembrey. During this period, Andrew Bird was a member of the jazz group Kevin O'Donnell's Quality Six, for which he was the lead singer and violinist and contributed to arrangements and songwriting for the albums ''Heretic Blues'' (Delmark 1999) and ''Control Freak'' (Delmark 2000) (both Delmark albums were produced by [[Raymond Salvatore Harmon]]).

In 2001, the Bowl of Fire released their third album, ''[[The Swimming Hour]]'', a dramatic departure from their previous recordings. It featured a mixture of styles, from the [[zydeco]]-influenced "Core and Rind" to more straightforward rock songs such as "11:11". Due to this eclectic nature, Bird has often referred to it as his "[[jukebox]] album".  Although gaining critical praise (''The Swimming Hour'' received a 9.0 from indie music website [[Pitchforkmedia|Pitchfork]]<ref name="Pitchfork Swimming Hour">{{cite news

The reluctant Bird performed the gig alone, and the surprising success of this solo show suggested potential new directions for his music.<ref name="NYT"/>

===Early solo career (2003–2005)===
[[Image:Andrew Bird live 20051028.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Andrew Bird in concert 2005]]
The Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded in 2003, and Bird went on to radically reinvent himself as a solo artist. His two subsequent albums were released on [[Ani Difranco]]'s [[Righteous Babe Records]] label. 2003's ''[[Weather Systems (Andrew Bird album)|Weather Systems]]'' (originally released on Grimsey Records) was a sparse record with a dramatic change in musical direction.  It featured the tracks "Skin" and "I", proto-versions of songs that would later become "Skin Is, My" (''[[The Mysterious Production of Eggs]]'') and "Imitosis" (''[[Armchair Apocrypha]]'').  On May 10, 2004, Andrew appeared on the Woodsongs Old-Time Radio Hour where he performed "First Song" and "Action Adventure" both from the Weather Systems album.  He discussed and demonstrated looping, which was how he could perform solo and still have a fully finished sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodsongs.com/show-archives/|title=WoodSongs Show Archives|website=WoodSongs Old Time Radio Hour|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>

''The Mysterious Production of Eggs'' (2005) continued a progression towards an eclectic [[indie rock|indie]]–[[folk music|folk]] sound, and both records formed a stark stylistic break with Bird's earlier work, swapping the lush backing of a full band for carefully layered samples of sound constructed using [[Multitrack Recording|multitrack recorders]] and [[Tape loop|loop pedals]]. As his sound changed, Bird made increasing use of guitar, glockenspiel, and whistling in his songwriting, in addition to his traditional violin and vocals.

Bird is noted for improvising and reworking his songs during live performance, as can be seen in his series of self-released live compilations entitled ''[[Fingerlings (album)|Fingerlings]]'', ''[[Fingerlings 2]]'', ''[[Fingerlings 3]]'', and ''Fingerlings 4'', the first of which was released in 2002. Each ''Fingerlings'' EP was released prior to a studio album, and presented a mixture of live performances from different shows, including old tracks, [[cover version|covers]], and previously unreleased songs, some of which have since appeared on studio albums. ''Fingerlings 3'', released in October 2006, also featured studio outtakes.  Fingerlings 2 provided Bird with an unexpected boost in recognition in 2004 when it was named album of the month by ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''.<ref name="Official Bio" />

In 2005, collaborator [[Martin Dosh]] joined Bird's line-up, adding percussion and keyboards to his sound.<ref name="Official Bio" /> [[Jeremy Ylvisaker]] was later added to the group on bass and backup vocals.

This song first appeared without Bird's lyrics as "Simple Exercises" on Dosh's 2004 release ''[[Pure Trash]]''. The album was produced by Ben Durrant (who had worked on Dosh's ''[[The Lost Take]]''), and also featured [[Haley Bonar]] and [[Chris Morrissey (musician)|Chris Morrissey]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Andrew Bird - Armchair Apocrypha|url = http://www.discogs.com/Andrew-Bird-Armchair-Apocrypha/release/1575687|website = Discogs|access-date = 2016-01-16}}</ref> In advance of the March release date, ''Armchair Apocrypha'' was leaked to the Internet in January 2007.

In 2011 "Andrew Bird: Fever Year", a feature-length concert documentary on Bird's year-long tour, had its World Premiere at Lincoln Center with the prestigious New York Film Festival. The film's festival-only run closed in 2013 after screening in over ninety international festivals and winning nine awards.

==Influences==
Growing up, Bird was surrounded by classical music.  As a child, he was interested in Irish tunes and bluegrass. He also cites English and Scottish folk music as an early influence.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilkinson |first=Sue |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8207766.stm |title=Andrew Bird's high-wire act takes flight |work=BBC News |date=August 19, 2009 |access-date=2012-10-31}}</ref> His early jazz influences were [[Johnny Hodges]], [[Lester Young]], and [[Fats Waller]].<ref>[http://www.concertlivewire.com/interviews/birdint.htm/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113142207/http://www.concertlivewire.com/interviews/birdint.htm/ |date=November 13, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://houstonist.com/2009/03/19/interview_andrew_bird.php |title=Interview: Andrew Bird |website=Houstonist.com |date=March 19, 2009 |access-date=2012-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004014912/http://houstonist.com/2009/03/19/interview_andrew_bird.php |archive-date=October 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He has also had a number of classical influences such as [[Claude Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel]], and [[Béla Bartók]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6613-andrew-bird/ |title=Interviews: Andrew Bird &#124; Features |website=Pitchfork.com |date=May 22, 2007 |access-date=2012-10-31}}</ref> Other influences included jazz, swing, calypso, and folk.

===The Handsome Family===
Andrew Bird appears to have a close relationship with [[The Handsome Family]], an Americana band from Illinois. Covers of their songs have appeared in several of his albums, including "When The Helicopter Comes," on ''[[Hands of Glory]]'', "Tin Foiled," on ''[[Fingerlings 3]]'', and "Don't Be Scared," from ''[[Weather Systems (Andrew Bird album)|Weather Systems]]''. His album, ''[[Things Are Really Great Here, Sort Of…]]'' is a ten-song cover album, with a strong country feeling.

The album's liner notes contain a response from Rennie Sparks, the band's lyricist and singer: "Hearing Andrew's version of our songs feels like suddenly spotting a new and shining doorway in the midst of a room I have spent my life in. It's like finding a stairway in the forest leading upward to the sky. His recasting of our work gives me the strange and wonderful pleasure of understanding my own songs better by hearing him perform them."<ref>Liner notes, ''Things Are Really Great Here, Sort Of...'', 2014.</ref>

==Instruments and gear==
One of Bird's primary instruments is a violin which he acquired when he was 16. His "first serious violin," was custom made by a Polish [[luthier]] in Chicago, and Bird had to audition to prove he was worthy of playing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/gallery/andrew-bird-10-essentials-interview#slide=1|title=10 Essentials: Andrew Bird|website=Gq.com|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref> In 2017, following the release of ''Are You Serious'', he commissioned Peter Seman to build a 5-string violin. The custom instrument features a lower C string (giving it the range of a [[viola]]), a unique scroll which bends backwards, and has no corners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semanviolins.com/andrew-bird |title=Andrew Bird — Seman Violins|website=Semanviolins.com|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>

For [[Loop (music)|looping]], Andrew Bird uses two [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6]] DL4 delay pedals: one for rhythmic pizzicato, and the other, "is dedicated to the ambient bowed strings." The DL4, on top of being able to loop, can also slow down and speed up loops, lowering or raising the pitch of a recording by an octave in the process. This feature occurs in many of Bird's songs, as well as live performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://line6.com/news/general/1464/ |title=Andrew Bird Builds a Wall of Sound Using Line 6 Delay Pedals|website=Line6.com|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref> He also uses an [[Effects unit#Pitch/frequency|octave pedal]] to give the violin the range of a bass.

He began using loop pedals to compensate when performing alone on stage, but later found that looping helped him to "embrace repetition," and compose his songs in a more straightforward manner, since he felt his writing style was too chaotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nodepression.com/finding-the-frequency-a-conversation-with-tift-merritt-and-andrew-bird/ |title=Finding the Frequency: A Conversation with Tift Merritt and Andrew Bird |website=Nodepression.com|date=July 8, 2019 |access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>

==Band members and associated acts==
Bird does not have a regular band that he plays with, and personnel changes with each album. Throughout his career, he has performed with a rotating cast of musicians. However, some musicians have appeared on several different albums, and performed with Andrew Bird on multiple tours.

* Martin Dosh - drums, electric piano. Dosh has provided drumming, keyboard, and loops for ''Armchair Apocrypha'' and ''Noble Beast'', as well as samples from his own music for songs such as "Simple X" (2007), "Not A Robot, But A Ghost" (2009), and "Take Courage" (2009).
* Alan Hampton - [[bass guitar]], [[standup bass]], guitar, & backup vocals. Hampton first appeared in [[Hands of Glory]] in 2012, and has gone on to perform with Bird on ''Things Are Really Great Here, Sort Of...'', ''Are You Serious'', and ''My Finest Work Yet''. Hampton also performed bass for the Bowl of Fire's reunion concert in 2018.
* [[Tift Merritt]] - vocals and guitar in the Hands of Glory as well as ''Things Are Really Great Here, Sort Of...''
* Nora O'Connor - backing vocals between ''The Swimming Hour'' (2001) and ''Break It Yourself'' (2012)

After ceasing to be the full-time drummer in Bird's bands, O'Donnell backed Bird again on the "Hands of Glory" & “Are You Serious” tours, and collaborated on the scores to the film ''[[Norman (film)|Norman]]'' and the FX TV series, ''[[Baskets (TV series)|Baskets]]''.<ref>"[http://kevinodonnellmusic.com/bio-encore Bio]" ''kevinodonnellmusic.com''. Retrieved November 1, 2021.
