==Early life==
George Ezra Barnett was born on 7 June 1993 in [[Hertford]], [[Hertfordshire]].

==Musical style==
Ezra cites [[Bob Dylan]], [[Woody Guthrie]] and James Baylin as his main musical influences. Some critics, however, have found it hard to discern these influences in Ezra's music. ''[[The Financial Times]]'' described it as music that "approximates rock ... but without any hint of danger, or unpredictability".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/3fc27eb2-4afb-11e9-bde6-79eaea5acb64 |title=A cosy evening with George Ezra at the O2 Arena, London |work=The Financial Times |date=20 March 2019 |access-date=12 June 2020}}</ref> ''When the Gramophone Rings'' described him as having "a voice beyond his years", with "a soulful tone that somehow would feel more at home coming from an [[Alabama]] bartender than a 21-year-old Bristolian".<ref>{{cite web|title=REVIEW: GEORGE EZRA // DID YOU HEAR THE RAIN?

A youthful obsession with Dylan prompted Ezra to seek out earlier American folk and blues artists. "Out of curiosity, I went to find how high I can jump off a cliff", he said. "That's when I found [[Lead Belly]], Woody Guthrie and [[Howlin' Wolf]]." Ezra had heard a Lead Belly compilation and had simply tried to sing like him. "On the back of the record, it said his voice was so big, you had to turn your record player down", Ezra said. "I liked the idea of singing with a big voice, so I tried it, and I could."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/09/14/george-ezra-budapest-on-the-verge/14706583/|title=On the Verge: George Ezra arrives by way of 'Budapest'|author=Brian Mansfield|date=14 September 2014|publisher=USA Today|access-date=5 December 2014}}</ref>
