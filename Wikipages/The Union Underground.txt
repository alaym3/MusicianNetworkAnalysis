'''The Union Underground''' is an American [[nu metal]] band based out of [[San Antonio, Texas]], United States. Original band members included Bryan Scott, [[Patrick Kennison]], [[John Moyer]] and Josh Memolo. They released one [[major label]] album, ''[[...An Education in Rebellion]]'', in July 2000 which featured the hit [[single (music)|single]] "Turn Me on 'Mr. Deadman'."

== History ==

===1996–2002; ''...An Education in Rebellion'' and break-up===
The roots of heavy metal band the Union Underground lie in the relationship between singer/guitarist Bryan Scott and guitarist Patrick Kennison, who met in junior high school in San Antonio, TX. After finishing high school, the two launched their own recording studio, Studio Underground, making cassettes of their music. Sales of 5,000 copies of an EP brought interest from major labels, with Portrait, the hard rock imprint of Sony's Columbia label, winning out as Scott and Kennison completed the band's lineup with the addition of drummer Josh Memolo and bassist John Moyer.

The Union Underground released its debut album, ''[[...An Education in Rebellion]]'', on July 18, 2000. The disc spent four months on the charts and the track "Turn Me on 'Mr. Deadman'" was on the mainstream rock charts for six months. After two years, the album's sales reportedly stood at 350,000. The band opened for Marilyn Manson in the fall of 2000 and earned a slot on the 2001 Ozzfest tour.

In March 2002, The Union Underground released the song "Across the Nation" which was used by the World Wrestling Federation, now known as [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], as the theme song for their [[WWE Raw|''RAW'']] brand until October 2006. Following the song's release, it earned extensive airplay nationwide.

On June 25, 2002, the band released ''Live...One Nation Underground'', a compilation of [[live album|live performances]]. This would be their final release before Portrait folded in 2002 and The Union Underground disbanded.

===2016-present; Reformation and upcoming second studio album===
In early 2016, Scott announced via the band's Facebook page that a new lineup and music would be available that summer, with a sample of a track ("False Caterpillars") available for 24 hours only.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/theunionundergroundofficial/photos/a.704405032983600.1073741827.443973302360109/942226025868165/?type=3|title=THE UNION UNDERGROUND Official added a... - THE UNION UNDERGROUND Official - Facebook}}</ref> Later in the year it was announced that an EP would be released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moshville.co.uk/news/2016/09/the-union-underground-announce-new-music-sample-enclosed/|title=The Union Underground announce new music (sample enclosed…) – The Moshville Times}}</ref> In 2018, a video announcing that new album details were 'coming soon' appeared on the band's YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQJXRlgN_J4|title=Union Underground - New Album details Coming Soon! - YouTube}}</ref> But no official release has surfaced yet.
