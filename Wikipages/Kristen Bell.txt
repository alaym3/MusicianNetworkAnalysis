Bell stated she never thought of herself as womanly because "I always play and look and act 10 years younger than I am."

Bell has been associated with the idea that "[[nerd]]y is the new cool", and she explained, "what was previously perceived as nerdy is now viewed as original. What I like about nerdiness, [[geek]]iness, is it doesn't really matter what you're into—it just means you're not a follower."<ref name="Complex"/> She has also said, "I love nerds.

Bell is sometimes confused with [[Lauren Conrad]] from ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]''. "Yeah, sometimes fans yell, 'Hey, Lauren' to me, but usually from a distance," said Bell.<ref name="Pulse" />

Despite "new celebrity" status, Bell claimed that she was not concerned because "no one ever recognizes me anyway". She has said that her friend [[Hayden Panettiere]] is more famous than she is and attracts more attention; as Bell explained, "I hang out with Hayden quite a bit—they never take pictures of me. I just step to the side, and I push myself in front of her when she wants to get out of it, or put her in the car."<ref name="Complex" />

Bell was a recurring guest on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', appearing in interviews as well as sketches. On ''The Late Late Show'', she shows a humorous hostility towards [[Craig Ferguson]]'s robot skeleton sidekick [[Geoff Peterson]], claiming that she had wanted to be Ferguson's sidekick on his show and taking it upon herself to cut Peterson down every chance she gets. Both Bell and Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five ''Late Late Show'' episodes filmed in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2011/08/01/craig-ferguson-paris-2/|title=Craig Ferguson's first show from Paris: A whimsical triumph, a potential classic|first=Ken|last=Tucker|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=August 1, 2011|access-date=August 28, 2011|archive-date=January 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118002229/https://ew.com/article/2011/08/01/craig-ferguson-paris-2/|url-status=live}}</ref>
