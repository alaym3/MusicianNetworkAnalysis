Woods began rapping in 10th grade, calling himself a "regular kid, I didn't really wanna rap",<ref name="XXL Break" /> after hearing classmate William Aston freestyle over a remade [[Chris Brown]] instrumental. Woods, Aston and another friend created a rap group, Steaktown, which broke up when Woods was 17.<ref name="Fader interview">{{cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/02/14/lil-uzi-vert-cover-story-interview-hawaii|title=Lil Uzi Vert Can't Be Bothered|work=The FADER|access-date=August 20, 2018|archive-date=August 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820234957/http://www.thefader.com/2017/02/14/lil-uzi-vert-cover-story-interview-hawaii|url-status=live}}</ref>
