After a disbandment in 2011, the band returned as a duo in 2020.

==History==
===Active years (1999–2011)===
Sugarfree was a pop-alternative group that was formed in 1999. Their sound was heavily influenced by the likes of Popsicle, [[The Eraserheads|Eraserheads]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], and [[Radiohead]]. The initial line up had [[The Pin-Ups|The Pin-Ups']] and Ciudad's Mitch Singson on drums. Singson left the band in August 2006 for personal reasons. Quisumbing immediately took over.

They were signed to [[Viva Records (Philippines)|Viva Records]] but their album was shelved. By 2003, with the help of Tracks Studio's Angee Rozul, their freshman offering was picked up and released by [[EMI]] Philippines (now known as PolyEast Records).

Sugarfree has worked with a some of the Philippines' premier record producers such as Angee Rozul and [[Rico Blanco]] for ''Sa Wakas'' (2003), [[Buddy Zabala]] and [[Raimund Marasigan]] (members of the  [[Eraserheads]]) for ''Dramachine'' (2004), Robin Rivera (also an album producer of the [[Eraserheads]]) for ''Tala-Arawan'' (2006), and Buddy Zabala and "Sancho" Sanchez for "Mornings and Airports" (2009). These albums have produced more than a handful of hit songs. "Hari ng Sablay" and "Makita Kang Muli", in particular, are the songs that brought Sugarfree into mainstream.

In 2007, Sugarfree held their first major concert at Music Museum. They shared the stage with the [[Manila Symphony Orchestra]].

In 2008, Sugarfree created and released the song "Pugad" as endorser of Dencio's, a local restaurant chain. In the same year, Sugarfree revived the song "Bawa't Bata", an APO Hiking Society original, as endorser of the milk brand Alactagrow. The band continues to endorse [[San Miguel Beer]] and [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]].

In August 2009, Sugarfree returned to the Music Museum with "Dekada: Sugarfree with the Manila Symphony Orchestra" which was a two-night concert in celebration of the band's 10th anniversary.

In 2010, Sugarfree together with other young musical artists sang [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]] MTV for the [[2010 Philippine general election|2010 Presidential Elections]] which is entitled as "Ako ang Simula". And at the same time they also sang "Panata Sa Bayan" for the theme of ABS-CBN's arch rival [[GMA-7]] Presidential Elections MTV, 50th Anniversary & its theme song of the [[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News & Public Affairs.]]

In a tweet early January 2011, Dancel has stated that he will be leaving the band by the end of February. He is also set to record his first solo album under [[Warner Music Philippines]].

Ebe Dancel also sang the OST for [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]'s "8 Kingdom", entitled "Hanggang Sa Dulo".

On March 1, 2011, Sugarfree held their farewell concert called "Paalam Pilipinas" at Eastwood Plaza, [[Libis]], [[Quezon City]].

===Post Sugarfree (2011–2020)===
After Sugarfree has disbanded in 2011, former frontman Ebe Dancel is now a solo artist. Dancel sang the song ''Purihin Ka'', a finalist in the [[DWAO-TV|UNTV]]'s 1st Gospel Talent Show, ''ASOP: A Song Of Praise'' in 2012.  Other former members of Sugarfree had moved to another band since they disbanded in 2011, as of 2012, Dancel still performs on both music and TV. Recently, he launched his album "''Bawat Daan''".

Jal Taguibao, the band's bassist, has moved on from the entertainment industry to the academe. He is now an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science, College of Social Sciences and Philosophy in the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]].<ref>UP Department of Political Science,  College of Social Science and Philosophy, University of the Philippines Diliman. (2013). Jalton G. Taguibao, https://polisci.upd.edu.ph/faculty/taguibao/</ref> In June 2018, Taguibao received his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in Political Science from the same university.

===Sudden return (2020–present)===
On February 25, 2020, or 4 days before Dancel's upcoming concert on February 29, the band made a surprise return as a duo of Taguibao and Quisumbing. The band released a new single "Nagkita Muli" on radio station [[DWJM|Jam 88.3]]. In an interview with [[GMA News]] Online, Taguibao decided to resurrect it because "they missed it". The surprised return was met with mixed reactions, with Ebe's brother and lawyer Vin Dancel stating that PolyEast Records owns the exclusive rights to the band's name under the 2002 artist agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/showbiz/chikaminute/727915/what-is-up-with-sugarfree-s-return/story/|title=What is up with Sugarfree's return?|last=Mallabo|first=Denise|website=[[GMA News]]|date=1 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://myx.abs-cbn.com/features/22529/new-sugarfree-song-without-ebe-dancel-reactions|title=NEW SUGARFREE SONG WITHOUT EBE DANCEL DRAWS MIXED REACTIONS|last=Fallore|first=Renuel|website=[[Myx]]|date=26 February 2020}}</ref>
