'''Malandragem''' ({{IPA-pt|malɐ̃ˈdɾaʒẽȷ̃}}) is  a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term for a lifestyle of idleness, fast living and petty crime – traditionally celebrated in [[samba]] lyrics, especially those of [[Noel Rosa]] and [[Bezerra da Silva]]. The exponent of this lifestyle, the ''malandro'' (masculine adjective), or "[[bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]]" (rogue, hustler, rascal, scoundrel, gangster), has become significant to Brazilian national identity as a [[folk hero]] or, rather, an [[anti-hero]].

The concept is common in [[Brazilian literature]],  [[Brazilian cinema]] and [[Brazilian music]].<ref>"Popular cinema in Brazil, 1930–2001", by Stephanie Dennison, Lisa Shaw, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7190-6499-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQsHp5Re3IoC&pg=PA21&dq=malandragem&hl=en&ei=rCb6TezzNofniAK4vtDoBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=malandragem&f=false section "Malandragem and jeitinho"]</ref>

==Definition==
''Malandragem'' is defined as any combination of strategies used in order to gain the advantage in a determined situation, typically of an illicit nature. It is characterized by [[List of French words and phrases used by English speakers#S|savoir faire]] and subtlety. Its execution demands aptitude, [[charisma]], cunning and whatever other characteristics (knacks) assist the ''malandro'' in the manipulation of people or institutions to obtain the best outcome with the least possible effort. 

Disregarding logical argumentation, labor and honesty, the ''malandro'' assumes that such methods are incapable of getting him a good outcome. Those who practice malandragem act in the manner of the popular Brazilian adage, immortalized in a catch-phrase from former [[Football in Brazil|Brazilian soccer]] player [[Gérson]] de Oliveira Nunes in a cigarette TV commercial (hence the name it was given: Lei de Gérson, or [[Gérson's law]]):  “I like to gain the advantage in everything.”

Together with the concept of [[jeitinho]], ''malandragem'' can be considered another typical—but not exclusive—Brazilian mode of social navigation. Unlike jeitinho, however, with malandragem the integrity of institutions and individuals can be effectively damaged, legally speaking as malicious. Successful ''malandragem'' presupposes that the advantages are gained without being exposed. In other words, the ''malandro'' dupes the ''otário'' (sucker) with the latter not noticing that.

''Malandragem'' is characterized in the Brazilian popular imagination as a tool for individual justice. Facing the forces of oppressive institutions, the individualist ''malandro'' survives by manipulating people, fooling authorities, and sidestepping laws in a way which guarantees his well-being. In this way, the ''malandro'' is a typical Brazilian hero. Literary examples include Pedro Malasarte and João Grilo.

Like ''jeitinho'', ''malandragem'' is an intellectual resource utilized by individuals of little social influence or by the [[socially disadvantaged]]. This does not stop the equal use of ''malandragem'' by those of better social positions. Through ''malandragem'', one gains illicit advantages in [[gambling]], business, and in the totality of their [[Interpersonal relationship|social life]].  One can consider to be a ''malandro'' the adulterer who convinces a woman of his false fidelity; the employer who finds a way to pay his employees less than what he owes; the player who manipulates his cards and wins the hand.

A ''malandro'' could be defined as someone who:
* Never works and lives off [[scam]]s; a [[confidence trick|con man]]
* Has shallow, uncommitted romantic relationships;
* Leads a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life of [[Hedonism|only fun and pleasure]]; 
* Is lazy, sluggish; 
* Cheats and deceives in order to prevail; a [[trickster]].

But, despite this apparent [[Egocentrism|egocentrical]], lying and malicious nature, the person who makes use of ''malandragem'' is not necessarily selfish. He could possibly be lazy, but the ''malandro'' is not careless with the people around him. He generally doesn't use ''malandragem'' to take advantage of another person intending to harm others, but rather only to find a way out of an unfair situation even if this means resorting to illegal methods. In fictional contexts, ''malandragem'' is often a device used to introduce [[wit]], a typical plot device/characteristic of an [[antihero]].
