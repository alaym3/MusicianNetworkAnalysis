'''Culture''' are a Jamaican [[roots reggae]] group founded in 1976. Originally they were known as the '''African Disciples'''. The one constant member until his death in 2006 was [[Joseph Hill (musician)|Joseph Hill]].

== History ==
The group formed in 1976 as the vocal trio of Joseph Hill (formerly a percussionist in [[Studio One (record label)|Studio One]] house band the [[Soul Defenders]]), his cousin Albert "Ralph" Walker, and Roy "Kenneth" Dayes, initially using the name The African Disciples.<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2002) ''Reggae & Caribbean Music'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}, p. 83-85</ref> Roy Dayes also used the name "Kenneth Paley", which is the name that appears on the Culture records released by Virgin Records.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} The African Disciples soon changed their name to Culture, and auditioned successfully for the "Mighty Two": producer [[Joe Gibbs (record producer)|Joe Gibbs]] and engineer [[Errol Thompson (audio engineer)|Errol Thompson]].<ref name="Thompson" /> While at Gibbs' studio, they recorded a series of singles, starting with "See Dem a Come" and including "Two Sevens Clash" (which predicted the apocalypse on 7 July 1977), many of which ended up on their debut album ''Two Sevens Clash''.<ref name="Barrow">Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004).

''Two Sevens Clash'' meanwhile had become a big seller in the United Kingdom, popular with [[punk rock]] fans as well as reggae fans and boosted by the support of [[John Peel]] on his [[BBC Radio 1]] show, and reached number 60 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] in April 1978.<ref name="Norris" /><ref name="Post">"[https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-149818821 Obituary: Joseph Hill]", ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'', 22 August 2006, retrieved 15 September 2012 {{HighBeam}}</ref><ref>"[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/culture Culture<small>(Link redirected to OCC website)</small>]", Chart Archive, retrieved 15 September 2012</ref> This prompted [[Virgin Records]] to sign the group to its [[Front Line (record label)|Front Line]] label, releasing ''Harder than the Rest'' (1978) and ''International Herb'' (1979).<ref name="Thompson" /> Culture also released records on other labels in Jamaica, including a [[Dub music|dub]] version of ''Harder than the Rest'', ''Culture in Dub'' (1978, High Note), and an album of different recordings of the same album, ''Africa Stand Alone'' (April 1978).<ref name="Thompson" /> An album recorded for Pottinger in 1979 with a working title of ''Black Rose'' remained unreleased until tracks emerged in 1993 on ''Trod On''.<ref name="Thompson" />

Hill performed at the ''[[Reggae Sunsplash]]'' festival in 1985 and in 1986 the original line-up reformed to record two highly regarded albums&nbsp;– ''Culture in Culture'' and ''Culture at Work''.<ref name="Thompson" />
