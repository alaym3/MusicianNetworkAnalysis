'''Los Campesinos!''' are a seven-piece [[indie pop]] band from [[Cardiff]], Wales, formed in early 2006 at [[Cardiff University]]. Though the band formed in Wales, none of the members are [[Welsh people|Welsh]]. The band has gone through several lineup changes during their career, with their current lineup consisting of Gareth Paisey (lead vocals, lyrics), Neil Turner (guitar), Tom Bromley (guitar), Rob Taylor (guitar, other instruments), Kim Paisey (keyboards, vocals), Matt Fidler (bass) and Jason Adelinia (drums); the members replace their surnames with "Campesinos" as [[stage name]]s. Paisey, Turner and Bromley are the only remaining original members still in the band.

The band released their debut album, ''[[Hold on Now, Youngster...]]'', in February 2008 and followed this up by releasing their second album, ''[[We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed]]'', in October that year. The band had previously referred to this release as a 'record' or an 'extended [[extended play|EP]]',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/gareth-campesinos-of-los-campesinos,14340/|title=Gareth Campesinos of Los Campesinos!}}</ref> before ultimately deciding to refer to it as their second album out of simplicity.<ref name="noisey1">{{cite web|last1=Garland|first1=Emma|title=Los Campesinos!

The band performed their first gig on 8 May 2006 at a student union club night; they went on to play a number of increasingly well-received gigs around Cardiff. An early [[Demo (music)|demo]] was recorded featuring the songs "Death To Los Campesinos!", "It Started With A Mixx", "Sweet Dreams Sweet Cheeks", and "You! Me! Dancing!". The songs were posted on the [[internet]], bolstering the popularity established by their energetic live shows and earning them airplay on [[Huw Stephens]]'s evening show on [[BBC Radio 1]] Wales.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} The band's reputation continued to grow, and in August 2006 landed them a slot supporting Canadian [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Broken Social Scene]].

On 7 December 2012, founding member Ellen announced she would be leaving the band following their show of 15 December at London's [[Islington Assembly Hall]]. She gave her reason for leaving, in a lengthy blog post, as wanting to "try something new".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ellen: It’s Been an Awfully Big Adventure |url=http://www.loscampesinos.com/blog/ellen-its-been-an-awfully-big-adventure/ |access-date=7 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210032216/http://www.loscampesinos.com/blog/ellen-its-been-an-awfully-big-adventure/ |archive-date=10 December 2012  }}</ref> Ellen's final show also featured former member Aleksandra providing guest vocals during the encore.

On 25 September, Los Campesinos announced a limited edition reissue of ''Romance is Boring'' and ''All's Well That Ends'', with the latter featuring a new cover created by R N Taylor. The reissued version of ''Romance is Boring'' comes with a zine documenting the creation of the album, titled '''Romance is Boring: An Oral History''<nowiki/>'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loscampesinos.com/news/rib2020|title='ROMANCE IS BORING' 10TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS|website=Los Campesinos!|language=en-US|access-date=25 September 2019}}</ref>

In 2020, the band played ''Romance Is Boring'' in full track listing order at 2 sold-out shows at Islington Assembly Halls on Valentine's Day and the following night, February 15th. Both sets were storming and enthusiastically received. The shows feature two sets, which featured the full album followed by a selection of ‘bangers’, as the band described them on Twitter.

The 2021 animated film ''[[The Mitchells vs. the Machines]]'' incorporates two songs by the band, both from ''Hold on Now, Youngster...''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/mitchells-vs-machines-soundtrack-guide-every-song/|title=The Mitchells vs. The Machines Soundtrack Guide: Every Song|first=Q.V.|last=Hough|website=ScreenRant|accessdate=April 30, 2021|date=April 30, 2021}}</ref> On 7 May, the band released ''Whole Damn Body'', an EP-length collection of tracks from the ''Hello Sadness'' era, via [[Bandcamp]].

== Band sound and influences ==
When the band first emerged on the [[indie pop]] scene, they were pigeonholed with the '[[twee pop]]' movement, as a result of their lively, joyous music. The band have worked hard since their 2008 debut, ''Hold On Now, Youngster'', to shake this image.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/on-hello-sadness-los-campesinos-shed-their-twee|title=On Hello Sadness, Los Campesinos! shed their 'twee'|newspaper=National Post|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> With their second recording, ''[[We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed]]'', critics generally applauded the band for adopting a new, darker guise.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} This continued through their following two albums, though whilst expanding the band's instrumental sounds.

As a band, they have before claimed to be heavily influenced by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[Guided By Voices]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]],<ref name="theLineofBestFitJan2010">{{cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/los-campesinos-the-12-records-that-influenced-romance-is-boring-24168/|title=Los Campesinos! :: The 12 Records that Influenced Romance Is Boring|author=Rich Hughes|work=The Line of Best Fit}}</ref> [[The Beautiful South]], [[Xiu Xiu]], [[Broken Social Scene]], [[Built To Spill]],<ref name="theLineofBestFitJan2010" /> [[Yo La Tengo]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], [[Belle & Sebastian]], [[The Magnetic Fields]], [[Joy Division]] and [[The Smiths]], amongst others. They also cite the literature of [[B. S. Johnson]], obsessions with death, and football as their non-musical influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/loscampesinos|title=Los Campesinos!|work=Myspace}}</ref>

Gareth has cited [[Paul Heaton]], the frontman of [[The Housemartins]] and [[The Beautiful South]], as his biggest influence as a songwriter. He told [[Stereogum]], "It’s safe to say, if it were not for Paul Heaton, I would never have wanted to write lyrics."<ref>{{cite web|title=Los Campesinos! – "I Love You (But You’re Boring)" (The Beautiful South Cover)|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1060721/los-campesinos-i-love-you-but-youre-boring-the-beautiful-south-cover/mp3s/|website=Stereogum|access-date=21 February 2018|date=11 June 2012}}</ref>
