'''The Protomen''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, who started their career on and are perhaps most widely known for composing [[concept album]]s loosely based on the [[video game]] series ''[[Mega Man (franchise)|Mega Man]]''.<ref name="mtsusidelines.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtsusidelines.com/2.3129/how-the-protomen-kidnapped-and-forced-me-to-ride-around-murfreesboro-blindfolded-for-20-minutes-just-for-a-one-on-one-interview-1.314331 |title=How the Protomen kidnapped and forced me to ride around Murfreesboro blindfolded for 20 minutes just for a one-on-one interview |first1=Andrew |last1=Johnson |date=April 20, 2005 |access-date=2011-10-12 |publisher=[[Middle Tennessee State University]] |work=Sidelines |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929184016/http://www.mtsusidelines.com/2.3129/how-the-protomen-kidnapped-and-forced-me-to-ride-around-murfreesboro-blindfolded-for-20-minutes-just-for-a-one-on-one-interview-1.314331 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 }}</ref> Their stage names are largely references to pop culture films, song titles, and fictional characters.

==History==
The band is composed mostly of [[Middle Tennessee State University|MTSU]] recording program graduates, and originated in order to meet class deadlines and the need to record for their grades.<ref name="mtsusidelines.com" /> Their first live performance was in April 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/murphy_weller/status/1595626605 |title=Murphy Weller on Twitter: "Happy belated Birthday to The Protomen (publicly).

In a 2009 interview, lead vocalist Panther stated, "We basically gathered up all of our good friends from the local rock bands of Murfreesboro, tied ourselves together, and tried to walk. And somehow it worked. At the time, we noticed a void in rock and roll. A hole that could only really be filled with grown men and women painting up like robots and playing some fierce and furious rock music based on a 1980s video game. We were fairly certain no one else was going to fill that hole. But, by God, it's filled now. You can thank us later."<ref name="Joystick">{{cite web |title=Interview With "The Protomen", A Mega Man Rock Opera |first1=Eric |last1=Nather |date=October 5, 2009 |access-date=2011-10-12 |url=http://www.joystickdivision.com/2009/10/interview_protomen_mega_man_rock_opera.php |work=Joystick Division |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008155521/http://www.joystickdivision.com/2009/10/interview_protomen_mega_man_rock_opera.php |archive-date=October 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The band has strong ties to the Murfreesboro and Nashville independent music scene, and some members perform with several bands.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

===''The Protomen''===
{{main|The Protomen (album)}}
In the band's first album, Dr. Wily is represented as an Orwellian ruler over a dystopic city, full of humans who are too scared to stand up to his control. Dr. Light creates a "perfect man, an unbeatable machine", Proto Man, to fight to free the city, but Proto Man is destroyed by the overwhelming power of Wily's armies. Defeated and despairing, Dr. Light then creates a second son, Mega Man, whom he attempts to dissuade from battle. Mega Man runs away from home and confronts his brother in an apocalyptic concluding battle. The album has been described by the band as "the sound of the end of the world" and straddles the line between [[chiptune]] and [[hard rock]], with heavier focus on distorted 8-bit synthesizers and electronic instrumentation.

Band member, Commander, has stated that the album "was made specifically to go against everything our recording teachers and fellow students were trying to feed us about making everything sound pristine and 'perfect.'".<ref name="catchynamenews.com" /> The album was recorded over two years in various Murfreesboro studios, using [[Analog recording|analog]] rather than [[Digital recording|digital]] production techniques.<ref>{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Rick |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_nashville_skyline_86/ |title=Nashville Skyline |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=2006-01-04 |access-date=2015-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328113302/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_nashville_skyline_86/ |archive-date=2012-03-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> "Due Vendetta", the group's first recorded track, was completed in April 2003. The album was produced by then-Protomen member Heath Who Hath No Name.

===''Act II: The Father of Death''===
{{main|Act II: The Father of Death}}

For the band's second album the group, working with [[Meat Loaf]] producer [[Alan Shacklock]], devised a prequel storyline to their first album. The second act details the rise of Albert Wily to power, the rivalry between himself and Thomas Light, and the tragic events which brought the City under Wily's control. The band stated that ''Act II'' was designed to sound cleaner, reflecting a time "before the bomb dropped". Accordingly, the second album reflects a much broader range of musical styles and more lyrical instrumentation, embracing references from [[Ennio Morricone]] to [[Bruce Springsteen]] to Shacklock's own [[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]]. The album was mastered by Richard Dodd, a [[Grammy]]-winning recording engineer.

===''The Protomen Present: A Night of Queen''===
{{main|Present: A Night of Queen}}

The Protomen are known for performing, along with their original rock opera, a variety of 1970s and 1980s cover songs in their live performances, typically related to the band's preferred motifs of heroism, struggle, and self-determination. On December 10, 2010, the Protomen performed along with Nashville band Evil Bebos for the latter band's farewell concert. Evil Bebos played a set entirely composed of [[Black Sabbath]] cover songs, while the Protomen in kind performed a set of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] covers.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Protomen and Evil Bebos Tribute to Queen & Black Sabbath at Exit/In, 12/10/10 |date=December 13, 2010 |last1=Zadlo |first1=Diana Lee |url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/the-protomen-and-evil-bebos-tribute-to-queen-and-black-sabbath-at-exitin-121010/Slideshow?oid=2082779 |work=[[Nashville Scene]] |access-date=2011-10-12}}</ref> The live performance was recorded and mastered, and on April 19, 2012, the Protomen announced through their website and mailing list that the resulting live album, titled ''The Protomen Present: A Night Of Queen'', would be released and was available for pre-order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protomen.com/news/2012/04/19/awesome-news-and-bad-news/ |title=Awesome News And Bad News |publisher=Protomen.com |date=2012-04-19 |access-date=2015-05-21}}</ref> Though set for a June 1, 2012 release, the album shipped early to those who pre-ordered it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://soundmachinestore.bigcartel.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425004018/http://www.soundmachinestore.bigcartel.com/product/protomen-present-a-night-of-queen|url-status=dead|title=Sound Machine Records|archive-date=25 April 2012|website=Soundmchinestore.bigcartel.com|access-date=20 November 2020}}</ref>

===''The Cover Up: Original Soundtrack From the Motion Picture''===
In November 2010 while performing at InDisFest in Atlanta, GA, the band announced their intention to formally record an album of cover songs. Production on the album began in February 2011 with producer, Alan Shacklock; the band's second collaboration with the producer following ''Act II''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmaz7HbEzrI |title=The Protomen's Reanimator Records Drums In The Studio |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2011-02-11 |access-date=2015-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.twitch.tv/indis/b/273290665|archive-url=http://archive.today/20170105130209/http://www.justin.tv/indis/b/273290665|url-status=dead|title=Twitch|website=Twitch.tv|archive-date=20 November 2020}}</ref> By June 2014, the band announced that a downloadable EP would be made available to attendees of their Warped Tour 2014 performances to promote the upcoming full-length album, titled ''The Cover Up''. The EP was released via a download code printed on a faux movie ticket stub for ''The Cover Up'', referencing a non-existent film, packaged in a laminate sleeve attached to a lanyard commemorating the Warped Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protomen.com/news/2014/06/12/victory-world-tour-pt-1-north-america/ |title=Victory World Tourâ€¦.pt. 1â€¦ North America |publisher=Protomen.com |date=2014-06-12 |access-date=2015-05-21}}</ref> The full-length album was released on January 23, 2015 to attendees of [[MAGFest]] 13, where The Protomen were performing. The following morning, on January 24, the album was made available for pre-order to the general public through the band's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.protomen.com/news/2015/01/23/finally/ |title=Finally |publisher=Protomen.com |date=2015-01-23 |access-date=2015-05-21}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
The group has cited the influence of "artists like [[Syd Mead]], films like ''[[Eddie and the Cruisers]]'' and ''[[Streets of Fire]]'', books like ''1984'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''... those are the pretty obvious ones you can pull out of Acts I and II. But what you might not realize is that we own every [[Ernest P. Worrell|Ernest]] movie ever made. And we watch them all the time."<ref name="Joystick" /> The band draws inspiration from diverse sources, including [[Sergio Leone]]'s films, the song "[[The Mexican (song)|The Mexican]]" and musical groups [[Radiohead]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]].

==Concepts and themes==
[[File:The Protomen at Holy Mountain (Austin, Texas) - 2014-10-21 (11).jpg|thumb|261x261px|The Protomen playing at Holy Mountain in Austin, Texas]]The Protomen's work is inspired by the first six [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] ''[[Mega Man#Original series|Mega Man]]'' games.<ref name="mtsusidelines.com" /> This franchise has an existing storyline featured in the games, manga, and anime; however, The Protomen have concocted a dark and dystopian version of the game's underlying world. The group is generally uninterested in concerns of making their story adhere to the original. Instead, they view the games as a jumping-off point for the story they want to tell, and have borrowed surface attributes of some characters while heavily altering their histories and functions.

The band has stated that they intend to make a three-part story. Two of the parts are completed with the release of their first two albums, while the third is in outline form.
The overall story as created by the band deals with loss, and they "don't really expect it to end well for humanity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.originalsoundversion.com/just-who-are-the-protomen-lets-find-out/ |title=Just Who Are The Protomen? Let's Find Out! |publisher=Originalsoundversion.com |access-date=2015-05-21}}</ref>

The Protomen have performed at a number of conventions, festivals and showcases throughout their career.

In 2007, The Protomen played at [[Capcom]]'s booth at [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic Con]] by Capcom's invitation.

They played two showcases at [[CMJ Music Marathon]] in October of the same year. In 2010, The Protomen took part in the [[SXSW]] music festival<ref>[http://my.sxsw.com/events/eid/11445]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref> and the mega-gaming conventions in [[PAX East]] in Boston (2010-2013) and [[Penny Arcade Expo#PAX Prime 2010 and 2012|PAX 2010]] in Seattle.
