'''Crying''' or '''weeping''' is the dropping of [[tears]] (or welling of tears in the eyes) in response to an [[emotion|emotional state]], or [[pain]]. Emotions that can lead to crying include [[sadness]], [[anger]], and even [[happiness]].  The act of crying has been defined as "a complex [[secretomotor]] phenomenon  characterized by the shedding of tears from the [[lacrimal apparatus]], without any irritation of the [[human eye|ocular]] structures", instead, giving a relief which protects from [[conjunctivitis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel V | title = Crying behavior and psychiatric disorder in adults: a review | journal = Comprehensive Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 206–11 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8339540 | doi = 10.1016/0010-440X(93)90049-A }} Quoted by Michelle C.P. Hendriks, A.J.J.M. Vingerhoets in ''Crying: is it beneficial for one's well-being?''</ref> A related medical term is [[lacrimation]], which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears.

For crying to be described as sobbing, it usually has to be accompanied by a set of other symptoms, such as slow but erratic [[inhalation]],  occasional instances of [[breath holding]] and muscular [[tremor]].

A [[biological neural network|neuronal connection]] between the [[lacrimal gland]] and the areas of the human brain involved with emotion has been established.

Tears produced during emotional crying have a chemical composition which differs from other types of tears. They contain significantly greater quantities of the hormones [[prolactin]], [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]], and [[Leu-enkephalin]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Science of Tears |vauthors=Skorucak A |work=ScienceIQ.com |access-date=25 May 2019 |url=http://www.scienceiq.com/Facts/ScienceOfTears.cfm |archive-date=14 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114200611/http://www.scienceiq.com/Facts/ScienceOfTears.cfm |url-status=live }}</ref> and the elements [[potassium]] and [[manganese]].<ref name="Cry p44">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walter C |date=December 2006 |title=Why do we cry? |journal=Scientific American Mind |volume=17 |issue=6 |page=44|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind1206-44 }}</ref>

The question of the function or origin of emotional tears remains open. Theories range from the simple, such as response to inflicted pain, to the more complex, including [[nonverbal communication]] in order to elicit [[altruistic]] helping behavior from others.<ref>{{cite journal |title=On the Origin of Crying and Tears |journal=Human Ethology Newsletter |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=5–6 |date=June 1989}}</ref><ref name="CryingGender">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stadel M, Daniels JK, Warrens MJ, Jeronimus BF |title= The gender-specific impact of emotional tears  |journal= Motivation and Emotion |date=2019 |doi= 10.1007/s11031-019-09771-z|volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=696–704|doi-access=free }}</ref> Some have also claimed that crying can serve several biochemical purposes, such as relieving stress and clearance of the eyes.<ref>{{cite web |vauthors=Doheny K |title=Why We Cry: The Truth About Tearing Up |url=http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/why-we-cry-the-truth-about-tearing-up?page=2 |publisher=WebMD |access-date=23 June 2011 |archive-date=15 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215185203/http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/why-we-cry-the-truth-about-tearing-up?page=2 |url-status=live }}</ref> There is some empirical evidence that crying lowers stress levels, potentially due to the release of hormones such as oxytocin.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Uvnäs-Moberg K, Handlin L, Petersson M | title = Self-soothing behaviors with particular reference to oxytocin release induced by non-noxious sensory stimulation | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 5 | pages = 1529 | date = 2015-01-12 | pmid = 25628581 | pmc = 4290532 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01529 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gračanin A, Bylsma LM, Vingerhoets AJ | title = Is crying a self-soothing behavior? | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 5 | pages = 502 | date = 2014-05-28 | pmid = 24904511 | pmc = 4035568 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00502 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Crying is believed to be an outlet or a result of a burst of intense emotional sensations, such as agony, surprise or joy.

Individuals tend to remember the positive aspects of crying, and may create a link between other simultaneous positive events, such as resolving feelings of [[grief]]. Together, these features of memory reinforce the idea that crying helped the individual.<ref>{{cite news|vauthors=Carey B|title=The Muddled Tracks of All Those Tears|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/03mind.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=18 July 2011|date=2 February 2009|archive-date=6 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106030904/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/03mind.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In [[Hippocratic]] and medieval medicine, tears were associated with the bodily [[humorism|humors]], and crying was seen as purgation of excess humors from the brain.<ref name = "Lutz_2001">{{cite book| vauthors = Lutz T |title=Crying : the natural and cultural history of tears|year=2001|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393321036 }}</ref> [[William James]] thought of emotions as reflexes prior to rational thought, believing that the physiological response, as if to stress or irritation, is a precondition to cognitively becoming aware of emotions such as fear or anger.

William H. Frey II, a biochemist at the [[University of Minnesota]], proposed that people feel "better" after crying due to the elimination of hormones associated with [[stress hormone|stress]], specifically [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]]. This, paired with increased mucosal secretion during crying, could lead to a theory that crying is a mechanism developed in humans to dispose of this stress hormone when levels grow too high.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emotional-freedom/201007/the-health-benefits-tears.|access-date=30 January 2015|title=Emotional Freedom}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Tears have a limited ability to eliminate chemicals, reducing the likelihood of this theory.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Murube J, Murube L, Murube A | title = Origin and types of emotional tearing | journal = European Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–84 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10435417 | doi = 10.1177/112067219900900201 | quote = Juan Murube, president of the Spanish Society of Ophthalmology, reports that the amount of blood passing through the lacrimal glands is tiny in comparison to the body's five liters of blood, and unlike other minor bodily excretion methods like breathing and perspiration, tears are mostly reabsorbed into the body. | s2cid = 21272166 }}</ref>

Recent psychological theories of crying emphasize the relationship of crying to the experience of perceived helplessness.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2003.09.001 | vauthors = Miceli M, Castelfranchi C |title=Crying: discussing its basic reasons and uses |journal=New Ideas in Psychology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=247–73 |year=2003}}</ref> From this perspective, an underlying experience of helplessness can usually explain why people cry. For example, a person may cry after receiving surprisingly happy news, ostensibly because the person feels powerless or unable to influence what is happening.

Emotional tears have also been put into an evolutionary context. One study proposes that crying, by blurring vision, can handicap aggressive or defensive actions, and may function as a reliable signal of appeasement, need, or attachment.<ref>{{Cite web |title=New Theory for Why We Cry |vauthors=Choi CQ |work=Live Science |date=28 August 2009 |access-date=25 May 2019 |url=https://www.livescience.com/7854-theory-cry.html |archive-date=25 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525183236/https://www.livescience.com/7854-theory-cry.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Oren Hasson, an [[evolutionary psychologist]] in the zoology department at [[Tel Aviv University]] believes that crying shows vulnerability and submission to an attacker, solicits sympathy and aid from bystanders, and signals shared emotional attachments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Cry?

Another theory that follows evolutionary psychology is given by Paul D. MacLean, who suggests that the vocal part of crying was used first as a "separation cry" to help reunite parents and offspring. The tears, he speculates, are a result of a link between the development of the cerebrum and the discovery of fire. MacLean theorizes that since early humans must have relied heavily on fire, their eyes were frequently producing reflexive tears in response to the smoke. As humans evolved the smoke possibly gained a strong association with the loss of life and, therefore, sorrow.<ref name = "Lutz_2001" />{{rp|90–91}} In 2017, [[Carlo Bellieni]] analysed the weeping behavior, and concluded that most animals can cry but only humans have psychoemotional shedding of [[tears]], also known as "weeping". Weeping is a behavior that induces empathy perhaps with the mediation of the [[Mirror neuron|mirror neurons network]], and influences the mood through the release of hormones elicited by the massage effect made by the tears on the cheeks, or through the relief of the sobbing rhythm.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellieni CV  |title=Meaning and importance of weeping. |journal=New Ideas in Psychology |volume= 46|pages= 72–76 |year=2017 |doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2017.06.003 }}</ref> Many ethologists would disagree.<ref name="Mamas last hug">{{cite book | vauthors = De Waal F |title= Mama's last hug: Animal emotions and what they tell us about ourselves  |publisher= W.W.

==Biological response==
[[File:Tears_.jpg|thumb|Children crying|alt=a young olive skinned boy crying and looking demurred ]]

It can be very difficult to observe biological effects of crying, especially considering many psychologists believe the environment in which a person cries can alter the experience of the crier. Laboratory studies have shown several physical effects of crying, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and slowed breathing. Although it appears that the type of effects an individual experiences depends largely on the individual, for many it seems that the calming effects of crying, such as slowed breathing, outlast the negative effects, which could explain why people remember crying as being helpful and beneficial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cry Me A River: The Psychology of Crying|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081217123831.htm|work=Science Daily|publisher=Association for :Psychological Science|access-date=18 July 2011|date=19 December 2008|archive-date=3 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903083950/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081217123831.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Globus sensation===
The most common [[side effect]] of crying is feeling a lump in the throat of the crier, otherwise known as a [[globus sensation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What Causes a Lump in the Throat Feeling? Globus Sensation|url=http://www.healthitalk.com/what-causes-lump-in-the-throat-feeling-globus-sensation/|work=Heath Talk|access-date=18 July 2011|archive-date=7 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107064339/http://www.healthitalk.com/what-causes-lump-in-the-throat-feeling-globus-sensation/|url-status=live}}</ref> Although many things can cause a globus sensation, the one experienced in crying is a response to the stress experienced by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. When an animal is threatened by some form of danger, the sympathetic nervous system triggers several processes to allow the animal to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flee]]. This includes shutting down unnecessary body functions, such as digestion, and increasing blood flow and oxygen to necessary muscles. When an individual experiences emotions such as sorrow, the sympathetic nervous system still responds in this way.<ref>{{cite web|vauthors=Glass D|title=A Lump in Your Throat|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/a-lump-in-your-throat/|work=Moment of Science|date=15 January 2007|access-date=19 July 2011|archive-date=12 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712205858/http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/a-lump-in-your-throat/|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Another function increased by the sympathetic nervous system is breathing, which includes opening the throat in order to increase air flow. This is done by expanding the [[glottis]], which allows more air to pass through. As an individual is undergoing this sympathetic response, eventually the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] attempts to undo the response by decreasing high stress activities and increasing recuperative processes, which includes running digestion. This involves swallowing, a process which requires closing the fully expanded glottis to prevent food from entering the [[larynx]]. The glottis attempts to remain open as an individual cries. This fight to close the glottis creates a sensation that feels like a lump in the individual's throat.<ref>{{cite web|vauthors=Onken M|title=What causes the 'lump' in your throat when you cry?|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1997-03/855114309.An.r.html|work=MadSci|publisher=Washington University Medical School|access-date=18 July 2011|date=16 February 1997|archive-date=25 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825115659/http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1997-03/855114309.An.r.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Other common side effects of crying are quivering lips, a [[runny nose]], and an unsteady, cracking voice.

==Frequency==
According to the German Society of Ophthalmology, which has collated different scientific studies on crying, the average woman cries between 30 and 64 times a year, and the average man cries between 6 and 17 times a year.<ref name="ophtalmologische1">{{cite web|title=Frauen und Männer weinen anders [German: Woman and Men Cry Differently]|url=http://www.dog.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/PM-Weinen.pdf|work=Pressearchiv 2009|publisher=Deutsche Ophtalmologische Gesellschaft|access-date=19 January 2015|date=October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119040016/http://www.dog.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/PM-Weinen.pdf|archive-date=19 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Men tend to cry for between two and four minutes, and women cry for about six minutes. Crying turns into sobbing for women in 65% of cases, compared to just 6% for men. Before adolescence, no difference between the sexes was found.<ref>{{cite news |title=Women cry more than men, and for longer, study finds |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6334107/Women-cry-more-than-men-and-for-longer-study-finds.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=15 October 2009 |location=London |access-date=5 April 2018 |archive-date=22 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422011140/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6334107/Women-cry-more-than-men-and-for-longer-study-finds.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="ophtalmologische1"/>

==In infants==
[[File:Crying infant (43101898172).jpg|thumb|A newborn child crying|alt=an Asian newborn crying and looking upset with its mouth open]]

Infants can shed tears at approximately 4–8 weeks of age.<ref name="Bylsma Gračanin Vingerhoets 2019 pp. 63–73">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bylsma LM, Gračanin A, Vingerhoets AJ | title = The neurobiology of human crying | journal = Clinical Autonomic Research | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–73 | date = February 2019 | pmid = 29687400 | pmc = 6201288 | doi = 10.1007/s10286-018-0526-y | publisher = Springer Science and Business Media LLC }}</ref>

Although crying is an infant's mode of communication, it is not limited to a monotonous sound. There are three different types of cries apparent in infants. The first of these three is a '''basic cry''', which is a systematic cry with a pattern of crying and silence. The basic cry starts with a cry coupled with a briefer silence, which is followed by a short high-pitched inspiratory whistle. Then, there is a brief silence followed by another cry. Hunger is a main stimulant of the basic cry. An '''anger cry''' is much like the basic cry; in this cry, more excess air is forced through the vocal cords, making it a louder, more abrupt cry. This type of cry is characterized by the same temporal sequence as the basic pattern but distinguished by differences in the length of the various phase components. The third cry is the '''pain cry''', which, unlike the other two, has no preliminary moaning. The pain cry is one loud cry, followed by a period of breath holding.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

[[T. Berry Brazelton]] has suggested that overstimulation may be a contributing factor to infant crying and that periods of active crying might serve the purpose of discharging overstimulation and helping the baby's nervous system regain homeostasis.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Application of Cry Research to Clinical Perspectives | vauthors = Brazelton TB |journal=Infant Crying |pages=325–340 |publisher=Springer, Boston, MA |date=1985 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-2381-5_15 |isbn=978-1-4612-9455-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Brazelton TB | date = 1992 | title = Touchpoints | location = New York | publisher = Perseus }}</ref>

[[Sheila Kitzinger]] found a correlation between the mother's prenatal stress level and later amount of crying by the infant. She also found a correlation between birth trauma and crying. Mothers who had experienced obstetrical interventions or who were made to feel powerless during birth had babies who cried more than other babies. Rather than try one remedy after another to stop this crying, she suggested that mothers hold their babies and allow the crying to run its course.<ref>Kitzinger, S. (1989). ''The Crying Baby''.

Based on these various findings, [[Aletha Solter]] has proposed a general emotional release theory of infant crying. When infants cry for no obvious reason after all other causes (such as hunger or pain) are ruled out, she suggests that the crying may signify a beneficial stress-release mechanism. She recommends the "crying-in-arms" approach as a way to comfort these infants.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Solter A | date = 1995 | url = https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1384901021/why-do-babies-cry | title = Why do babies cry? | journal = Pre- and Perinatal Psychology Journal | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–43 | access-date = 2019-05-25 | archive-date = 2019-05-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190525113210/https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1384901021/why-do-babies-cry | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Solter A | date = 1998 | title = Tears and Tantrums: What to Do When Babies and Children Cry. | location = Goleta, CA | publisher = Shining Star Press | isbn = 978-0-9613073-6-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Solter A | date = January–February 2004 | url = http://www.awareparenting.com/comfort.htm | title = Crying for comfort: distressed babies need to be held. | journal = Mothering | issue = 122 | pages = 24–29 | access-date = 2013-09-18 | archive-date = 2013-09-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130906061611/http://www.awareparenting.com/comfort.htm | url-status = live }}</ref> Another way of comforting and calming the baby is to mimic the familiarity and coziness of mother's womb.

Spatial perspective explains sad crying as reaching out to be "there", such as at home or with a person who may have just died. In contrast, joyful crying is acknowledging being "here." It emphasized the intense awareness of one's location, such as at a relative's wedding.<ref name="Katz1999" />

Temporal perspective explains crying slightly differently. In temporal perspective, sorrowful crying is due to looking to the past with regret or to the future with dread. This illustrated crying as a result of losing someone and regretting not spending more time with them or being nervous about an upcoming event. Crying as a result of happiness would then be a response to a moment as if it is eternal; the person is frozen in a blissful, immortalized present.<ref name="Katz1999" />

The last dimension is known as the public-private perspective. This describes the two types of crying as ways to imply details about the self as known privately or one's public identity. For example, crying due to a loss is a message to the outside world that pleads for help with coping with internal sufferings. Or, as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] suggested, sorrowful crying is a method of self-pity or self-regard, a way one comforts oneself. Joyful crying, in contrast, is in recognition of beauty, glory, or wonderfulness.<ref name="Katz1999" />

The [[Twelver Shi’ism|Shia Ithna Ashari]] (Muslims who believe in twelve Imams after Muhammad) consider crying to be an important responsibility towards their leaders who were martyred.
They believe a true lover of Imam Hussain can feel the afflictions and oppressions Imam Hussain suffered; his feelings are so immense that they break out into tears and wail. The pain of the beloved is the pain of the lover. Crying on Imam Hussain is the sign or expression of true love. 
The Imams of Shias have encouraged crying especially on Imam Husaain and have been informed about rewards for this act. They support their view through a tradition (saying) from Muhammad who said: (On the Day of Judgment, a group would be seen in the most excellent and honourable of states. They would be asked if they were of the Angels or of the Prophets. In reply they would state): "We are neither Angels nor Prophets but of the indigent ones from the ummah of Muhammad". They would then be asked: "How then did you achieve this lofty and honourable status?" They would reply: "We did not perform very many good deeds nor did we pass all the days in a state of fasting or all the nights in a state of worship but yes, we used to offer our (daily) prayers (regularly) and whenever we used to hear the mention of Muhammad, tears would roll down our cheeks".(Mustadrak al‑Wasail, vol 10, pg. 318)

In [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christianity, tears are considered to be a sign of genuine repentance, and a desirable thing in many cases. Tears of true contrition are thought to be sacramental, helpful in forgiving sins, in that they recall the [[Baptism]] of the penitent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pravmir.com/prayer-xvii-compunction-tears/ |title=On Prayer XVII: On Compunction and Tears &#124; A Russian Orthodox Church Website |publisher=Pravmir.com |date=2014-06-18 |access-date=2017-06-02 |archive-date=2016-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531083350/http://www.pravmir.com/prayer-xvii-compunction-tears/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/l/lutz-crying.html |title=Crying |work=Nytimes.com |date=1992-03-10 |access-date=2017-06-02 |archive-date=2017-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828014944/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/l/lutz-crying.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Types of tears==
{{main|Tears}}
[[File:Gray896.png|thumb|right|A diagram showing the [[lacrimal apparatus]]]]
There are three types of tears: basal tears, reflexive tears, and psychic tears. Basal tears are produced at a rate of about 1 to 2 microliters a minute, and are made in order to keep the eye lubricated and smooth out irregularities in the [[cornea]]. Reflexive tears are tears that are made in response to irritants to the eye, such as when chopping onions or getting poked in the eye. Psychic tears are produced by the lacrimal system and are the tears expelled during emotional states.<ref name = "Lutz_2001" />{{rp|68}}
