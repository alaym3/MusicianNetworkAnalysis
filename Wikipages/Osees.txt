'''Osees''' are an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[San Francisco, California]] in 1997, now based in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The band currently consists of primary songwriter and core member [[John Dwyer (musician)|John Dwyer]] (vocals, guitar), Tim Hellman (bass), Tuglass Buttle (drums), Paul Quattrone (drums) and Tomas Dolas (keyboards).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heyreverb.com/blog/2015/05/13/thee-oh-sees-at-the-gothic-theatre-photos-review/103694/ |title=Thee Oh Sees at the Gothic Theatre (photos, review) |website=Heyreverb.com |date=May 13, 2015 |access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref> Osees sound incorporates a wide range of [[Rock music|rock]] genres, including 1960s [[garage rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]], [[punk rock]], [[noise rock]], [[Art rock|art punk]], and 1980s [[post-punk]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/43pa7q/the-guide-to-getting-into-the-oh-sees|title=The Oh Sees' 20 Albums Are Weird and Diverse.

Initially an outlet for Dwyer ([[Coachwhips]], [[Pink and Brown]] and [[The Hospitals]]) to release experimental home recordings, Osees evolved into a full band, featuring [[Brigid Dawson]] (vocals, keyboard), [[Petey Dammit]] (bass, guitar), Mike Shoun (drums), and Lars Finberg (drums, guitar). Over the course of several releases and genre transitions, the band became noted for their prolific discography, energetic live shows, and whimsical visual aesthetic. The band has changed its lineup and name several times, having previously been known as '''Orinoka Crash Suite''', '''OCS''', '''Orange County Sound''', '''The Ohsees''', '''The Oh Sees''', '''Thee Oh Sees''', and '''Oh Sees'''.

In late 2013, it was announced that the band would be entering a hiatus. A new studio album, however, entitled ''[[Drop (Thee Oh Sees album)|Drop]]'', was released in 2014, and Oh Sees subsequently toured as a three-piece, with [[Sic Alps]] bassist Tim Hellman and [[White Fence (musician)|White Fence]] drummer [[Nick Murray (musician)|Nick Murray]] replacing Dawson, Dammit!, and Shoun. In 2015, Dawson returned to the band, in a studio capacity, for its next studio album, ''[[Mutilator Defeated At Last]]''. Following its release, Dwyer and Hellman began touring with two drummers, Ryan Moutinho and Dan Rincon, replacing Murray. Touring extensively, this line-up recorded the band's seventeenth and eighteenth studio albums, ''[[A Weird Exits]]'' and ''[[An Odd Entrances]]'', with Moutinho departing in late 2016 to focus on his own projects.<ref name="TheReprise">{{cite web |url= http://www.thereprise.org/features/2017/2/22/thee-oh-sees-ryan-moutinho |title=''Odd Entrances'' and ''Weird Exits'': In Conversation with Thee Oh Sees' Ryan Moutinho |first=Andrew |last=Lindsay |work=thereprise.org |access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>

With the arrival of new drummer Paul Quattrone, and an ever-increasing public profile, the band recorded its nineteenth album, ''[[Orc (Oh Sees album)|Orc]]'', with co-producers [[Ty Segall]], Eric Bauer and Enrique Tena. In late 2017, Dwyer reunited with Dawson for a primarily acoustic album, ''[[Memory of a Cut Off Head]]'', which returned to the band's lo-fi roots, and featured several former and current Oh Sees members.

After two studio albums featuring a heavy, [[progressive rock]] sound—''[[Smote Reverser]]'' (2018) and ''[[Face Stabber]]'' (2019)—the band changed its name to Osees in July 2020, with the announcement of their twenty-third album, ''[[Protean Threat]]''. The group continued to release prolifically under the new name, putting out two additional LPs and an EP before the end of 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/09/osees-new-album-metamorphosed-electric-war-stream/|title=Oh Sees (as Osees) Announce New Album Metamorphosed, Share 'Electric War'|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=Graves|first=Wren|date=September 18, 2020|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequence.net/2020/09/osees-panther-rotate-origins-dont-blow-your-experiment/|title=Oh Sees (as Osees) Announce New Remix Album Panther Rotate, Share the Origins for 'Don’t Blow Your Experiment'|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=Schatz|first=Lake|date=September 23, 2020|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequence.net/2020/09/osees-new-ep-weirdo-hairdo/|title=Oh Sees (as Osees) Announce New EP Weirdo Hairdo|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|last=Graves|first=Wren|date=September 23, 2020|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years and solo recordings (1997–2004)===
John Dwyer began releasing songs on compilation albums under the name Orinoka Crash Suite as early as 1997. Initially, OCS served as a solo project for Dwyer while he focused on his participation in other groups, including Pink and Brown, Zeigenbock Kopf, and Coachwhips.

The first album, simply titled ''1'', was released in 2003 as the first full album under the OCS name. The first disc was based around acoustic songs, and was individually referred to as ''34 Reasons Why Life Goes On Without You''. The second disc was a series of "noise" tracks called ''18 Reasons To Love Your Hater To Death.'' None of the songs on either disc have titles. The album's song credits are mostly attributed to John Dwyer, though three are credited to Jeff Rosenberg, who was the drummer under the pseudonym "Brown" in Pink and Brown. The album features several guest musicians, but no one who would continue on to the next album, entitled ''2''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

''[[2 (Thee Oh Sees album)|2]]'' was released in 2004, and was made in a similar fashion to ''1'', but with a greater focus on Dwyer as a solo performer.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===First transitional period and lineup changes (2005–2007)===
The band slowly transitioned from being Dwyer's side project into his primary group, as his other bands Coachwhips and Zeigenbock Kopf both disbanded during this period (2005 and 2006, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Coachwhips|title=Last.fm page for Coachwhips|website=Last.fm|access-date=February 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Zeigenbock+Kopf|title=Last.fm page for Zeigenbock Kopf|website=Last.fm|access-date=February 12, 2013}}</ref>

OCS became a [[Rock band#Two parts|two-piece]] with the addition of Patrick Mullins who played percussion and [[Musical saw|saw]]. The arrangements continued to be simple, though bolstered by the addition of Mullins. The project's third and fourth studio albums, ''[[Songs About Death & Dying Vol. 3]]'' and ''[[OCS 4: Get Stoved]]'' were released as a two-CD set in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/f614585a-99dc-39c2-9216-ba4f956aa790|title=Release group "3 & 4" by OCS - MusicBrainz|website=musicbrainz.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> ''3'' was available both as part of this set, and as an individual vinyl release. ''4'' did not see a vinyl issue until 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicbrainz.org/release-group/6372d454-277d-4b31-ab57-2dc98dcb7ea3|title=Release group ''OCS 4: Get Stoved'' by OCS - MusicBrainz|website=musicbrainz.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>

Brigid Dawson was previously a member of the duo Mix Tape with Meric Long of [[The Dodos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingmagazine.com/sounds/sounds-thee-oh-sees/|title=Surfing Magazine Interview|website=Surfingmagazine.com|access-date=February 12, 2013}}</ref> She had been working in a coffee shop in San Francisco, and would frequently see Dwyer visit the shop and put up flyers for his upcoming shows. The two became fast friends, and Dwyer eventually asked Dawson to join the band after seeing one of her shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heartymagazine.com/features/brigid-dawson-of-thee-oh-sees|title=hearty magazine Interview with Brigid Dawson|website=Heartymagazine.com|access-date=February 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/05/thee-oh-sees-brigid-dawson_n_1859578.html|title=Huffington Post Interview with Brigid Dawson|website=Huffingpost.com|access-date=February 12, 2013|first=Aaron|last=Sankin|date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> Her role includes duet/backing vocals, keyboards, and tambourine. Dawson will occasionally perform lead vocals (in the cases of "Invitation" on ''Sucks Blood'' and "What Are We Craving?" on ''[[Castlemania]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sucks-blood/id252777900|title=iTunes Page for ''Sucks Blood''|website=Itunes.apple.com|access-date=February 1, 2013}}</ref>

As a trio, the band released ''[[The Cool Death of Island Raiders]]'' in 2006, their first release under the name The OhSees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/cool-death-of-the-island-raiders-mw0000727425/credits|title=Allmusic page for ''Cool Death of Island Raiders''|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=February 12, 2013}}</ref> The album was co-produced by [[TV on the Radio]] members [[Dave Sitek]] and [[Kyp Malone]].

[[Petey Dammit|Petey Dammit!]] joined the group in 2007, as a bassist and occasionally second guitarist. Dammit was previously a member of the two-piece band Tres Ferocious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Tres+Ferocious|title=Last.fm page for Tres Ferocious|website=Last.fm|access-date=February 17, 2013}}</ref> John Dwyer was familiar with the band's work, and asked him to join when he was looking to expand the lineup of The Ohsees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/06/08/interview-thee-oh-sees/|title=The Fader Interview with Brigid Dawson|website=Thefader.com|access-date=February 17, 2013}}</ref> Dammit's bass playing uncharacteristically involves using an ordinary electric guitar that is fed through an electronic device that makes it sound like a bass guitar. His method of doing this is intentionally kept a secret.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://everguide.com.au/music/gigs-and-festivals/interview/petey-dammit--thee-oh-sees.aspx|title=Everguide interview with Petey Dammit|website=Everguider.com.au|access-date=February 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126080529/http://everguide.com.au/music/gigs-and-festivals/interview/petey-dammit--thee-oh-sees.aspx|archive-date=January 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Dammit typically favors Fender Jazzmaster guitars for this task, but in ''Thee Hounds of Foggy Notion'', he is also seen using a blue Italia Mondial without this manipulation, for songs that were not recorded with a bass guitar.

The album ''Sucks Blood'' followed in 2007. It would be the final studio album to feature Patrick Mullins, but he would appear later in the live DVD/album ''Thee Hounds Of Foggy Notion'' that was released in 2008. Mullins moved to Louisville, Kentucky and in 2010 he released a solo album called ''Don't Go To Sleep''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terminal-boredom.com/larsvsohsees.html |title=You Will See This Dog Before You Die |publisher=Terminal Boredom |access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ear-rational.com/detail.php?id=67762 |title=Ear/Rational Music! |website=Ear-rational.com |access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref>

Jigmae Baer played for a year as the group's drummer after Mullins had left the band. He recorded with the band for their Tascam 388 recordings, as well as their sessions with Dave Sitek. His work can be heard on ''Sucks Blood'', ''[[The Master's Bedroom is Worth Spending a Night In]]'', and various 7" and 10"s releases during this period. Baer went on to play with [[Ty Segall]] in both his solo act and in The Perverts. Baer then founded the Royal Baths and currently is a founding member of LODRO.

Mike Shoun joined the band as the new drummer after Baer's departure. Shoun's arrival coincided with the band's change into a louder [[Garage punk (fusion genre)|garage punk]] based sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/features/660|title=Interview with John Dwyer|website=Dustedmagazine.com|access-date=February 12, 2013}}</ref>

===Garage, psychedelia, and punk (2008–2013)===
With the new four-piece lineup established, the scope of the band's music and success started to increase. ''The Master's Bedroom is Worth Spending a Night In'' was released in 2008, under the name Thee Oh Sees. This album is also notable for being the first collaboration with Chris Woodhouse, a [[mix engineer]] and guest musician who would continue to appear on the albums that followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11477-the-masters-bedroom-is-worth-spending-a-night-in/|title=Thee Oh Sees: ''The Master's Bedroom Is Worth Spending A Night In''|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> The band released their album ''[[Help (Thee Oh Sees album)|Help]]'' in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12981-help/|title=Thee Oh Sees: ''Help''|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> This was their first album released on [[In the Red Records]], the label for most of their main releases up until 2013. The album, ''[[Dog Poison]]'', was also released this year, an acoustic take on the newer, more upbeat sound of the band.

''[[Warm Slime]]'' arrived in 2010,  following strongly in the footsteps of ''Help''. The album's first side is dominated by the title track, with a running time of 13:30. The song's long format and repetitive structure foreshadowed the [[krautrock]] influence that would become a larger part of their sound in the new decade.

On April 28, 2011, Patrick Mullins rejoined the band for a one-off performance at the [[Cafe Du Nord]] in their hometown of San Francisco. The band played songs from the albums ''4'' through ''The Master's Bedroom is Worth Spending a Night In''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaybridged.com/2011/05/02/photos-thee-oh-sees-get-mellow-at-cafe-du-nord-42811/ |title=Photos: Thee Oh Sees get mellow at Cafe Du Nord, 4/28/11 : The Bay Bridged – San Francisco Bay Area Indie Music |website=Thebaybridged.com |date=May 2, 2011 |access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/thee-oh-sees/2011/cafe-du-nord-san-francisco-ca-73d38acd.html |title=Thee Oh Sees Concert Setlist at Café du Nord, San Francisco on April 28, 2011 |website=Setlist.fm |access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref> Most of these songs had not been included in the setlists for some time.

The recording of 2011's ''[[Castlemania]]'' was solely undertaken by John Dwyer and Brigid Dawson and a series of other notable musicians. Petey Dammit and Mike Shoun would record on the year's latter album ''[[Carrion Crawler/The Dream]]'' along with new member Lars Finberg (from [[The Intelligence]]). Finberg joined as a full-time second drummer and second guitar player,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2011/04/thee_oh_sees_re.htm|title=Thee Oh Sees releasing ''Castlemania'' (MP3), released a singles collection, add Lars Finberg to group, announced some dates|website=Brooklynvegan.com|access-date=February 11, 2013}}</ref> but continues to lead and tour with The Intelligence. Dawson and Dwyer approached 2012's ''[[Putrifiers II]]'' in a similar manner as the group recorded ''Castlemania''.

In 2011, the band's single "Tidal Wave" was featured in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode "[[Salud (Breaking Bad)|Salud]]", where it plays over [[Gus Fring]]'s poisoning of Don Eladio and his capos.

In 2013, "The Dream", from ''Carrion Crawler/The Dream'' was included in the soundtrack for the video game [[Grand Theft Auto V]].

On April 16, 2013, The band released ''[[Floating Coffin]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://exclaim.ca/News/thee_oh_sees_announce_floating_coffin|title=Thee Oh Sees Announce ''Floating Coffin'' |magazine=[[Exclaim!]]|date=January 28, 2013}}</ref> The album was released on Castle Face Records, a label that John Dwyer co-owns with Brian Lee Hughes and Matt Jones. The album was the first since ''The Master's Bedroom ... '' to be self-released. Later that year, they released the ''[[Floating Coffin#Moon Sick EP|Moon Sick EP]]'', a collection of four songs from the ''Floating Coffin'' sessions that were excluded from the album. The EP was released as a benefit for Healthy San Francisco, a healthcare organization that had aided Dwyer and his friends over the years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fensepost.com/main/2013/04/22/the-oh-sees-present-moon-sick/|title=Thee Oh Sees present Moon Sick|last=Andy Fenstermaker|date=2013-04-22|website=FensePost|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>

===Second transitional period (2013–2015)===
On December 18, 2013 during a show at San Francisco's Great American Music Hall, Dwyer announced to the crowd "This will be the last Oh Sees show for a long while. So dig in."

In an interview with ''SF Weekly'', the band's tour manager Annie Southworth confirmed the news, noting that Dwyer was looking to take some time off as he made the move from San Francisco to Los Angeles. She added, "They need a break after 5 years straight, so yes ... hiatus time. Will be a little hard to continue with all the different locales so who knows what is going to happen ... Cross fingers, we all are that it's not completely over."

The statements led to rumors that the band was entering an indefinite hiatus, or breaking up. On December 20, 2013, the band cleared the rumors by posting on their official site that a new LP will be coming in early 2014, and "we will see where the live shows go from there." On February 12, it was announced that the album, entitled ''Drop'', would be released on April 19 through Castle Face Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53948-thee-oh-sees-announce-new-album-drop-share-penetrating-eye/ |title=Thee Oh Sees Announce New Album ''Drop'', Share "Penetrating Eye" &#124; News |website=Pitchfork.com |date=February 12, 2014 |access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref> It was created by John Dwyer and Chris Woodhouse, similar to the creation of previous Thee Oh Sees albums like ''Putrifiers II'', ''Dog Poison'', and ''Castlemania''.

Brigid Dawson relocated to San Marin, CA, where she continues to paint and exhibit artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/05/brigid_dawson_t.html |title=Brigid Dawson taking a break from playing live with Thee Oh Sees (who have a new lineup) but you can see her art in Brooklyn |website=Brooklynvegan.com |date=May 7, 2014 |access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.needles-pens.com/news/gallery/brigid-dawsons-dedicated-to-dear-earholes/ |title=Needles & Pens Brigid Dawson's Dedicated To Dear Earholes - Needles & Pens |website=Needles-pens.com |date=September 2, 2012 |access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref> Mike Shoun & Petey Dammit have remained in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaye |first=Ben |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/12/thee-oh-sees-announce-indefinite-hiatus/ |title=Thee Oh Sees announce hiatus, but will release new album in early 2014 |website=Consequenceofsound.net |date=December 20, 2013 |access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref> Dammit appeared as the bassist on Dylan Shearer's Empty Cellar Records/Castle Face release ''garagearray'', released on April 15, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/04/dylan_shearer_r.html |title=Dylan Shearer releasing new LP on Castle Face featuring Petey Dammit of Thee Oh Sees (stream 2 tracks) |website=Brooklynvegan.com |date=April 9, 2014 |access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref> In 2014, Dammit joined former member Lars Finberg's band, [[The Intelligence]].

Since the dispersal of the band members, the band's live performances have been as a trio, with drummer Nick Murray, and bassist Timothy Hellman. Brigid Dawson's roles as a vocalist and keyboardist have not been filled. John Dwyer explained the reason for the latter in an interview with [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut magazine]]: "The future of the band doesn't hold much keyboard, I want to go more guitar. I'll still record with a keyboard but I'm burned out with it live. I've been getting trapped into synthesizer land, I'm just surrounded by drum machines and keyboards while all my rock and roll stuff is in another studio." Brooklyn Vegan noted that while the band is currently touring as a trio, this should not be considered a permanent, "official" lineup change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/05/thee_oh_sees_ar_1.html |title=Thee Oh Sees will tour as a trio, with new drummer and bassist |website=Brooklynvegan.com |date=May 7, 2014 |access-date=June 21, 2015}}</ref>

In 2015, however, the new line-up of the band entered the studio to record its fourteenth studio album, ''[[Mutilator Defeated At Last]]'', with Brigid Dawson returning to the band as its backing vocalist. Following the album's release, drummers Ryan Moutinho and Dark Chocolate Dan joined both Dwyer and Hellman in the band's live line-up. In 2019, the album came at no.23 on ''[https://happymag.tv/ Happy Mag]''<nowiki/>'s "[https://happymag.tv/the-25-best-psychedelic-rock-albums-of-the-2010s/ 25 Best Psychedelic Rock Albums of The 2010s]" with high praise of the albums "textured density."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://happymag.tv/the-25-best-psychedelic-rock-albums-of-the-2010s/|title=The 25 best psychedelic rock albums of the 2010s|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> In February 2016, the band released a stand-alone single from the album's sessions, entitled "[[Fortress (Thee Oh Sees song)|Fortress]]", and announced a live album, ''[[Live in San Francisco (Thee Oh Sees album)|Live in San Francisco]]'', from its accompanying tour, which was released on July 1, 2016.

===Name changed to Oh Sees and prolific output (2016–2019)===
With the core line-up solidifying into the four-piece of Dwyer, Hellman, Moutinho and Rincon, the band toured extensively, releasing a new single, "Plastic Plant", alongside an announcement that they'd be releasing a new album entitled ''[[A Weird Exits]]'' on August 12 of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1879301/thee-oh-sees-plastic-plants/mp3s/ |title=Thee Oh Sees - "Plastic Plants" |website=Stereogum.com |date=May 26, 2016}}</ref> A second album recorded during the same sessions, ''[[An Odd Entrances]]'', was released on  November 18, 2016. Two days prior to its release, Ryan Moutinho departed from the band, stating: "I'm not here to list reasons as they are personal and the list would be far too long. ... Thank you for coming to the shows and giving every ounce of energy to us. I promise I tried my very best to give it back in return.

On June 7, 2017, Dwyer announced the name of the band has changed to Oh Sees and released a track entitled "The Static God" from their upcoming record ''[[Orc (Oh Sees album)|Orc]]'', which was released on August 25, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/thee-oh-sees-announce-19th-studio-album-and-confirm-name-change|title=!Thee Oh Sees announce 19th studio album and confirm name change|website=Thelineofbestfit.com}}</ref>

Three days after ''Orc''{{'}}s release, Dwyer announced that the title of the band had yet again changed back to the original moniker of OCS, and released the track "Memory of a Cut Off Head" from the [[Memory of a Cut Off Head|album of the same name]], due out November 17, as the 100th record on Castle Face. The band made it clear that this was a one time name for this album only, and returned to the lineup of Dwyer and Dawson, as well as returning to their original hushed sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/08/ocs-aka-oh-sees-announce-new-album.html|title=OCS (aka Oh Sees) Announce Their 20th Album in 20 Years as a Band|website=Pastemagazine.com|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref> On December 28, 2017, the band announced the return to the name Oh Sees along with a new EP, ''Dead Medic'', consisting of two long tracks from the ''Orc'' sessions, including a cover of "A Few Days of Reflection" by the Swedish Band [[Träd, Gräs & Stenar|Träd, Gräs, och Stenar]]

===Osees (2019–present)===

On November 23, 2019, the band released ''The 12" Synth'' including two 20-minute tracks on the YouTube channel of Castleface Records, under the name of "Osees". The album was made available on Spotify after a few weeks, December 10, 2019.

The band released its first full-length studio album under the Osees name, ''[[Protean Threat]]'', on September 18, 2020. A week later, on September 26th, the band released a streamed live performance with [[Levitation_(festival)|Levitation]]. The full performance was later uploaded to the Levitation YouTube channel in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttQeHu-4e94|title=OSEES - LEVITATION Sessions (Full Set)|website=youtube.com}}</ref> A month later, the band released [[Metamorphosed (album)|''Metamorphosed'']] on October 16th, which featured a few leftover songs from the production of ''Face Stabber'', as well as two longer tracks. The band closed off the year releasing ''Panther Rotate'', a "companion LP [to ''Protean Threat''] of remixes, field recordings, and sonic experiments",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.castlefacerecords.com/products/osees-panther-rotate|title=''Panther Rotate'' on Castleface Records|website=castlefacerecords.com}}</ref> as well as ''Weirdo Hairdo'', an EP featuring a cover of [[The_Spiders_(American_rock_band)|The Spiders]]' "Don't Blow Your Mind". On December 19th, Osees released another streamed live performance where they performed covers of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Liket Lever]], and [[Faust (band)|Faust]] songs, as well as a good bunch of their own.

In March 2021, it was announced that Osees were releasing another recorded live performance with Levitation. It is set to release April 10th.

==Philosophy==
In a September 2012 interview with New York Music News, Petey Dammit explained the band's philosophy on recording:<ref name="NYMN September 2012">{{cite web |title=NYMN Interview – Petey Dammit of Thee Oh Sees |url=http://nymn.com/nymn-interview-petey-dammit-of-thee-oh-sees/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915104133/http://nymn.com/nymn-interview-petey-dammit-of-thee-oh-sees/|url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-15| website=nymn.com|date=September 12, 2012 |access-date=September 23, 2012}}</ref>

{{quote|We work hard. I think it seems strange for us to release so many records because of the tradition in the recording industry to do things a certain way. For decades it has been months and months in the studio, one release a year, tour this, tour that, do this, do that ... We just do what we want to do. Most of the songs have been worked out by the time we get to the studio so we can record them all live in two days. The other two days in the studio are having fun writing on the spot and having fun.}}
