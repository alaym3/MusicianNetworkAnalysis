'''Oasis''' were<!--'were' is correct British English, please do not change it to 'was'. See WP:ENGVAR for more info.--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1991. They were originally known as the Rain before evolving into Oasis, and initially consisted of [[Liam Gallagher]] (lead vocals, tambourine), [[Paul Arthurs]] (guitar), [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul McGuigan]] (bass guitar), and [[Tony McCarroll]] (drums). Upon returning to Manchester, Liam's older brother [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]] (lead guitar, vocals) joined as a fifth member, finalising the band's core line-up. During the course of their existence, they had various line-up changes, though the Gallagher brothers remained as the staple members.

Oasis signed to independent record label [[Creation Records]] in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994). The following year they recorded ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995) with drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], in the midst of a [[Britpop#"The Battle of Britpop"|chart rivalry]] with [[Britpop]] peers [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. Spending ten weeks at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' was also an international chart success, and became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]. In addition, it stands as the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|fifth-best-selling album in the UK]], and the [[List of best-selling albums of the 1990s in the United Kingdom|biggest-selling album in the UK of the 1990s]]. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] for their disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] for an audience of 125,000 each night, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]''; becoming the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. However, its popularity declined quickly.

McGuigan and Arthurs left in 1999 as Oasis released ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'' (2000). They were replaced by former [[Heavy Stereo]] guitarist [[Gem Archer]] and former [[Ride (band)|Ride]] guitarist [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]]. White departed in 2004, replaced by [[Zak Starkey]] and later [[Chris Sharrock]] as touring members. Oasis released three more studio albums, ''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'' (2002), ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' (2008). The group abruptly disbanded after the departure of Noel in August 2009.

As of 2009, Oasis have sold over 70 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|date=22 June 2009|title=Some might say Oasis are still world beaters after Slane gig|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/some-might-say-oasis-are-still-world-beaters-after-slane-gig-14351086.html|access-date=4 May 2010|work=The Belfast Telegraph|archive-date=27 July 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140727211536/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/some-might-say-oasis-are-still-world-beaters-after-slane-gig-28484657.html|url-status=live}}</ref> They are among the most successful acts on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and [[UK Albums Chart|Albums Chart]], with eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Oasis-Coldplay-Take-That-enter-Guinness-World-Records-2010-Book/blog/713512/7691.html|title=Oasis, Coldplay & Take That enter Guinness World Records 2010 Book – Guinness World Records Blog post|publisher=Community.guinnessworldrecords.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124221745/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Oasis-Coldplay-Take-That-enter-Guinness-World-Records-2010-Book/blog/713512/7691.html|archive-date=24 January 2010|access-date=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/oasis/24788|title=Oasis receive Outstanding Brit Award|date=19 October 2006|work=NME.COM|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-date=22 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022202938/http://www.nme.com/news/oasis/24788|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oasisinet.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825180037/http://www.oasisinet.com/|url-status=dead|title=The Official Oasis Website &#124; Oasis Be Here Now reissue|archive-date=25 August 2015|website=Oasis}}</ref> The band also achieved three [[RIAA certification|platinum]] albums in the US.

==History==
===1991–1993: Formation and early years {{anchor|the_rain}}===
In 1991, bassist [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul McGuigan]], guitarist [[Paul Arthurs]], drummer [[Tony McCarroll]], and singer Chris Hutton formed a band called the Rain. Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance [[Liam Gallagher]] as a potential replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis, inspired by an [[Inspiral Carpets]] tour poster in the childhood bedroom he shared with his brother [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]], which listed the [[Oasis Leisure Centre]] in [[Swindon]] as a venue.<ref>Harris, John. ''Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock''. Da Capo Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-306-81367-X}}, pg.&nbsp;124–25</ref> Oasis played their first gig on the 14th August, 1991 at the [[Boardwalk (music club)|Boardwalk]] club in [[Manchester]], bottom of the bill below The Catchmen and [[Sweet Jesus]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/artefact/31176/OASIS_BOARDWALK_OTHER_1991 |title=Oasis, Other – The Boardwalk, 14th August 1991 – Manchester Digital Music Archive<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=20 August 2021 |archive-date=20 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210820142123/https://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/artefact/31176/OASIS_BOARDWALK_OTHER_1991 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/oasis-first-ever-setlist-with-noel-gallagher/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2021 |archive-date=20 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210820143342/https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/oasis-first-ever-setlist-with-noel-gallagher/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Noel, who was working as a [[road crew|roadie]] for Inspiral Carpets, went with them to watch Liam's band play. He and his friends did not think Oasis sounded particularly spectacular, but he began to consider the possibility of using the group as an outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining on the provision that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. Arthurs recalled, "He had loads of stuff written. When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas."<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;125–26</ref> Under Noel, the band crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity, with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing [[barre chord]]s and [[root (chord)|root bass notes]], McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion. Oasis thus created a sound described as being "so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable".<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;127–28</ref>

=== 1993–1995: Breakthrough with ''Definitely Maybe'' ===
After over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a demo, the ''[[Live Demonstration]]'' tape, Oasis's big break came in May 1993 when they were spotted by Creation Records co-owner [[Alan McGee]]. Oasis were invited to play a gig at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] club in [[Glasgow]] by Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along with a group of friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry as they were not on that night's set list; the band and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they managed to get into the club.<ref>VH1 Behind the Music, [[VH1]], 2000</ref> They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see [[18 Wheeler (band)|18 Wheeler]], one of his own bands. McGee offered them a recording contract; however, they did not sign until several months later.<ref>"Oasis." Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis signed a worldwide contract with [[Sony]], which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 131</ref>

Following a limited white label release of the demo of their song "Columbia", Oasis went on a UK tour to promote the release of their first single, "[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]", playing venues such as the Tunbridge Wells Forum, a converted public toilet. "Supersonic" was released in April 1994, reaching number&nbsp;31 in the charts.<ref>Harris, pg. 149</ref> The release was followed by "[[Shakermaker]]", which became the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages. Their third single, "[[Live Forever (Oasis song)|Live Forever]]", was their first to enter the top ten of the UK charts. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, Oasis's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', was released on 29 August 1994, entering the charts at number one within a week of its release, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 178</ref>

Nearly a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a [[hedonistic]] lifestyle, were taking their toll on the band. This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994, leading to an inept performance by Liam during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and hit Noel with a [[tambourine]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Grundy|first=Gareth|title=Born To Feud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher|work=The Guardian|date=30 August 2009|access-date=27 February 2013|archive-date=29 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229011850/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher|url-status=live}}</ref>  The incident upset Noel to such an extent he temporarily quit the band and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident the song "[[Talk Tonight]]" was written). He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, the elder Gallagher was persuaded to continue with the band. He reconciled with Liam and the tour resumed in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>Harris, pg. 189</ref> The group followed up with the fourth single from ''Definitely Maybe'', "[[Cigarettes & Alcohol]]", and the Christmas single "[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]", issued in December 1994 which entered the British charts at number three.<ref>Harris, pg. 213</ref>

===1995–1996: ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', international success, and peak popularity===
Oasis had their first UK number one single in April 1995 with "[[Some Might Say]]". At the same time, drummer Tony McCarroll was ousted from the band. McCarroll said, on leaving Oasis, that he was "unlawfully expelled from the partnership" for what he called a "personality clash" with the brothers. The Gallaghers, on the other hand, doubted McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: "I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|title=Supanet entertainment music feature|publisher=Supanet.com|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622220353/https://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/288881.stm|title=£550,000 for sacked Oasis drummer|work=BBC News|date=3 March 1999|access-date=3 February 2008|archive-date=30 June 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030630093536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/288881.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> McCarroll was replaced by [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], formerly of [[Starclub]] and younger brother of renowned studio percussionist [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]] and recommended to Noel by [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]]. White made his debut for the band at a ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performance of "Some Might Say". Oasis began recording material for their second album in May of that year in [[Rockfield Studios]] near [[Monmouth]].<ref>Harris, pg. 226</ref> The band, by this point, had recorded the concert that would see release in August as ''[[Live by the Sea]]''.

During this period, the British press seized upon a supposed rivalry between Oasis and Britpop band [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. Previously, Oasis did not associate themselves with the Britpop movement and were not invited to perform on the [[BBC]]'s ''Britpop Now'' programme introduced by Blur singer Damon Albarn. On 14 August 1995, Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, setting up the [[Britpop#"The Battle of Britpop"|"Battle of Britpop"]] that dominated the national news.<ref>{{cite news |title=When Blur beat Oasis in the battle of Britpop |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/blur-beat-oasis-in-chart-battle/ |access-date=17 September 2019 |work=The Telegraph |archive-date=25 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325233841/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/blur-beat-oasis-in-chart-battle/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Blur's "[[Country House (song)|Country House]]" outsold Oasis' "[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll with It]]" 274,000 copies to 216,000 during the week.<ref>Harris, pg. 235</ref> Oasis' management came up with several reasons for this, claiming "Country House" sold more because it was less expensive (£1.99 vs £3.99) and because there were two versions of "Country House" with different B-sides, forcing serious fans to buy two copies.<ref>Harris, pg. 233</ref> An alternative explanation given at the time by Creation was that there were problems associated with the barcode on the "Roll with It" single case, which did not record all sales.<ref>Author unknown.

''Melody Maker''. 23 September 1995.</ref> He apologised in a formal letter to various publications.<ref>Harris, pg. 251</ref>

McGuigan briefly left the band in September 1995, citing nervous exhaustion. He was replaced by Scott McLeod, formerly of the Ya Ya's, who was featured on some of the tour dates as well as in the "Wonderwall" video before leaving abruptly while on tour in the US. McLeod contacted Noel Gallagher claiming he felt he had made the wrong decision. Gallagher replied: "I think you have too. Good luck [[Jobseeker's Allowance|signing on]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/glastonbury2004/story/0,,1242267,00.html|title=Not here now|work=The Guardian|date=19 June 2004|last=Robinson|first=John|access-date=9 March 2008|location=London|archive-date=26 June 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HfsFxlut?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/jun/19/glastonbury2004.popandrock|url-status=live}}</ref> To complete the tour, McGuigan was persuaded to return to the band.

Although a softer sound initially led to mixed reviews, Oasis' second album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', was a worldwide commercial success, selling over four million copies and becoming the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|fifth-best-selling album]] in UK chart history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-60-official-biggest-selling-albums-of-all-time-revealed__15551/|title=The UK's 60 official biggest selling albums of all time revealed|last=Copsey|first=Rob|date=4 July 2016|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709012251/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-60-official-biggest-selling-albums-of-all-time-revealed__15551/|archive-date=9 July 2016|url-status=live|access-date=11 May 2018}}</ref> By 2008, it had sold up to 22 million units in the world, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6151050.stm|title=Queen head all-time sales chart|work=BBC News|date=16 November 2006|access-date=9 March 2008|archive-date=4 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204064437/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6151050.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> The album spawned two further hit singles, "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]" and "[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]", which reached numbers two and one respectively. It also contained the non-UK single "[[Champagne Supernova]]", which featured guitar and backing vocals by [[Paul Weller]] and received critical acclaim. The song reached number one on the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. In November 1995, Oasis played on back-to-back nights at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in London, the biggest ever indoor gigs in Europe at the time.

===1996–1999: ''Be Here Now'' and ''The Masterplan''===
[[File:oasis 1997.jpg|thumb|Oasis, 1997. L–R: Alan White, Paul McGuigan, Noel Gallagher, Paul Arthurs and Liam Gallagher]]
Oasis spent the end of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London and Ridge Farm Studios in [[Surrey]] recording their third album. Quarrels between the Gallagher brothers plagued the recording sessions. ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' was released in August 1997. Preceded by the UK number&nbsp;one single "[[D'You Know What I Mean?]]", the album was their most anticipated effort, and as such became the subject of considerable media attention. Footage of excited fans clutching copies made ''[[ITV News at Ten]]'', leading anchorman [[Trevor McDonald]] to intone the band’s phrase "mad for it".<ref name="Lynskey"/> By the end of the first day of release, ''Be Here Now'' had sold 424,000 units and first week sales reached 696,000, making it the fastest-selling album in British history until [[Adele]] released ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]'' in 2015.<ref name="Lynskey"/><ref>Harris, pg. 342.</ref> The album debuted at number&nbsp;two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US, but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924518/live_forever|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715015259/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924518/live_forever|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 July 2007|title=Rolling Stone news article|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> Predominantly written by Noel Gallagher during a holiday with [[Kate Moss]], [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Mick Jagger]], Gallagher has since expressed regret over the writing process of ''Be Here Now'', adding it doesn't match up to the standard of the band's first two albums;

It burned out quickly, falling well short of the sales achieved by 1995’s ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', with many copies ending up in secondhand racks. Noel himself quickly disowned it, dismissing it in the 2003 Britpop documentary ''[[Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop|Live Forever]]'' as “the sound of five men in the studio, on coke, not giving a fuck”.

Noel had been ambivalent about the album in pre-release interviews, telling ''[[NME]]'', "This record ain’t going to surprise many people," however there was nobody around him to echo his reservations. “Everyone’s going: ‘It’s brilliant!’” he later said. “And right towards the end, we’re doing the mixing and I’m thinking to myself: ‘Hmmm, I don’t know about this now.’”<ref name="Lynskey"/> When the album was released Oasis were woven into Britain’s cultural fabric like no other band since the Beatles, and according to their former press officer Johnny Hopkins: "There were more hangers-on, constantly telling them they were the greatest thing. That tended to block out the critical voices."<ref name="Lynskey"/> Dorian Lynskey writes, "If it couldn’t be Britpop’s zenith, then it must be the nadir. It can’t be just a collection of songs – some good, some bad, most too long, all insanely overproduced – but an emblem of the hubris before the fall, like a dictator’s statue pulled to the ground by a vengeful mob."<ref name="Lynskey"/> 

After the conclusion of the [[Be Here Now Tour]] in early 1998, amidst much media criticism, the group kept a low profile. Later in the year, Oasis released a compilation album of fourteen B-sides, ''[[The Masterplan (Oasis album)|The Masterplan]]''. "The really interesting stuff from around that period is the B-sides. There's a lot more inspired music on the B-sides than there is on ''Be Here Now'' itself, I think," said Noel in an interview in 2008.<ref>[http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&articleid=26083 Wave Magazine News article].

It was during this time period that Noel lived at [[Supernova Heights]] in [[Belsize Park]] with his then wife Meg Matthews. Noel Gallagher lived at this property between 1997 and 1999 which was known for raucous celebrity parties with guests such as [[Kate Moss]], [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Lisa Moorish]] and fellow band [[The Charlatans (English band)|The Charlatans]]. The house was eventually sold in 1999 to [[Davinia Taylor]].

===1999–2001: Line-up change and ''Standing on the Shoulder of Giants''===
In early 1999, the band began work on their fourth studio album. First details were announced in February, with [[Mark Stent]] revealed to be taking a co-producing role. Things were not going well and the shock departure of founding member [[Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs]] was announced in August. This departure was reported at the time as amicable, with Noel stating Arthurs wanted to spend more time with his family. Arthurs' statement clarified his leaving as "to concentrate on other things".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/415855.stm|title=Gallagher shrugs off Oasis departure|work=BBC News|date=10 August 1999|access-date=9 March 2008|archive-date=12 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112142225/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/415855.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> However, Noel has since offered a contradicting version: that a series of violations of Noel's "no drink or drugs" policy (imposed by Noel so that Liam could sing properly) for the album's sessions resulted in a confrontation between the two.<ref name="book">{{Cite book| author=St. Michael, Mick | title=Oasis: In Their Own Words | publisher=Omnibus Pr | year=1996 | isbn=0-7119-5695-2}}</ref> Two weeks later the departure of bassist [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul McGuigan]] was announced.

The now three-piece Oasis chose to continue recording the album, with [[Noel Gallagher]] re-recording most of [[Paul Arthurs|Bonehead]]'s guitar and McGuigan's bass parts.

After the completion of the recording sessions, the band began searching for replacement members. The first new member to be announced was new lead/rhythm guitarist [[Gem Archer|Colin "Gem" Archer]], formerly of [[Heavy Stereo]], who later claimed to have been approached by Noel Gallagher only a couple of days after Arthurs' departure was publicly announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mad4gem.tripod.com/biography.htm|title=tripod.com|publisher=Mad4gem.tripod.com|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-date=30 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730165249/http://mad4gem.tripod.com/biography.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Finding a replacement bassist took more time and effort: the band were rehearsing with David Potts, but he quickly resigned, and they brought in [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]], former guitarist/songwriter of [[Ride (band)|Ride]] and [[Hurricane No. 1|Hurricane#1]] as their new bassist. Bell had never played bass before and had to learn to play it (with Noel since saying, "I was amazed that Andy was up for actually playing the bass y’know, cos he’s such a good guitarist"), along with a handful of songs from Oasis' back catalogue, in preparation for a scheduled US tour in December 1999.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Randall |first1=Lucian |title=Noel Gallagher – The Biography |date=2012 |publisher=Kings Road Publishing}}</ref>

With the folding of [[Creation Records]], Oasis formed their own label, [[Big Brother Recordings|Big Brother]], which released all of Oasis' subsequent records in the UK and Ireland. Oasis' fourth album, ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'', was released in February 2000 to good first-week sales. It reached number one on the British charts and peaked at number&nbsp;24 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref>[http://www.oasisinet.com/site.php?site=album&atype=0&country=172&idx=19 Oasis – Official Website – Discography] retrieved on 15 December 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011005304/http://www.oasisinet.com/site.php?site=album&atype=0&country=172&idx=19 |date=11 October 2007 }}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=oasis|chart=all}} Billboard.com – Discography – Oasis – Standing on the Shoulders of Giants]{{dead link|date=February 2011}} retrieved on 15 December 2007</ref> Four singles were released from the album: "[[Go Let It Out]]", "[[Who Feels Love?]]", "[[Sunday Morning Call]]" and "[[Where Did It All Go Wrong?]]", which the first three were top five UK singles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/|title=Top 40 Singles|publisher=Thetop40charts.co.uk|access-date=28 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016220614/http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/|archive-date=16 October 2015}}</ref>  The "Go Let It Out" music video was shot before Bell joined the group and therefore featured the unusual line-up of Liam on rhythm guitar, Archer on lead guitar and Noel on bass. With the departure of the founding members, the band made several small changes to their image and sound. The cover featured a new "Oasis" logo, designed by Gem Archer, and the album was also the first Oasis release to include a song written by [[Liam Gallagher]], entitled "Little James". The songs also had more experimental, psychedelic influences.<ref name="allmusicstanding">[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r466450|pure_url=yes}} Standing on the Shoulders of Giants > Overview ].

To support the record the band staged an eventful world tour. While touring in [[Barcelona]] in 2000, Oasis were forced to cancel a gig when an attack of [[tendinitis]] caused [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]]'s arm to seize up, and the band spent the night drinking instead. After a row between the two brothers, Noel declared he was quitting touring overseas altogether, and Oasis were supposed to finish the tour without him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/760729.stm|title=Oasis Noel quits tour|work=BBC News|date=23 May 2000|access-date=15 December 2007|archive-date=1 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901184211/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/760729.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> Noel eventually returned for the Irish and British legs of the tour, which included two major shows at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

===2001–2003: ''Heathen Chemistry''===
[[File:Oasis-band-concert-Montreal-Canada-Aug2002.jpg|thumb|Oasis performing in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2002]]
Throughout 2001, Oasis split time between sessions for their fifth studio album and live shows around the world. Gigs included the month-long [[Tour of Brotherly Love]] with [[the Black Crowes]] and [[Spacehog]] and a show in Paris supporting [[Neil Young]]. The album, ''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'', Oasis' first album with new members Andy Bell and Gem Archer, was released in July 2002. The album reached number&nbsp;1 in the UK and number&nbsp;23 in the US,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2113780.stm|title=Elvis and Oasis enjoy chart success|work=BBC News|date=7 July 2002|access-date=14 December 2007|archive-date=3 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203133228/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2113780.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r595973|pure_url=yes}} Heathen Chemistry > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums].

The record blended the band's sonic experiments from their last albums, but also went for a more basic rock sound.<ref name="allmusicheathen"/> The recording of ''Heathen Chemistry'' was much more balanced for the band, with all of the members, apart from White, writing songs. [[Johnny Marr]] provided additional guitar as well as backup vocals on a couple of songs.

After the album's release, the band embarked on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In late summer 2002, while the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist [[Jay Darlington]] were involved in a car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, the latter half of the German leg of the band's European tour had to be postponed after [[Liam Gallagher]], [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]] and three other members of the band's entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a [[Munich]] nightclub.

===2003–2007: Alan White's departure and ''Don't Believe the Truth''===
[[Liam Gallagher]] said Oasis began recording a sixth album in late December 2003 with producers [[Death in Vegas]] at Sawmills Studios in Cornwall. The album was originally planned for a September 2004 release, to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of [[Definitely Maybe]], However, long-time drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], who at this time had played on nearly all of the band's material, had been asked to leave the band.<ref name="whitekickedout">{{cite web|publisher=Oasis Official Website|title=Alan White|url=https://www.oasisinet.com/news/alan-white/|access-date=11 November 2020|archive-date=17 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117133022/https://www.oasisinet.com/news/alan-white/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[NME]]|title=ALAN WHITE'S DEPARTURE FROM OASIS CONFIRMED|date=16 January 2004|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/oasis-841-1371613|access-date=11 November 2020|archive-date=12 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112201239/https://www.nme.com/news/music/oasis-841-1371613|url-status=live}}</ref> At the time, his brother [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]] stated on his own website that "the spirit of being in a band was kicked out of him" and he wanted to be with his girlfriend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whiteydrums.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815014323/http://www.whiteydrums.com/|url-status=dead|title=Steve White &#124; Drummer &#124; Percussionist &#124; Educator &#124; The Official Site|archive-date=15 August 2015|website=www.whiteydrums.com}}</ref> White was replaced by [[Zak Starkey]], drummer of [[the Who]] and the son of [[the Beatles]]' [[Ringo Starr]].

Starkey played publicly for the first time at [[The Lighthouse (Poole)|Poole Lighthouse]].

A few days later, Oasis, with Starkey, headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival]] for the second time in their career and performed a largely greatest hits set, which included two new songs&nbsp;— Gem Archer's "A Bell Will Ring" and Liam Gallagher's "The Meaning of Soul". The performance received negative reviews, with ''NME'' calling it a "disaster."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/oasis/7678|title=NME news article|date=12 September 2005|work=NME.COM|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-date=25 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925204616/http://www.nme.com/reviews/oasis/7678|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC's Tom Bishop called Oasis' set "lacklustre and uneventful&nbsp;... prompting a mixed reception from fans", mainly because of Liam's uninspired singing and Starkey's lack of experience with the band's material.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3842947.stm|title=Oasis fail to surprise Glastonbury|work=BBC News|date=26 June 2004|last=Bishop|first=Tom|access-date=3 February 2008|archive-date=28 May 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528032646/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3842947.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

After much turbulence, the band's sixth album was finally recorded in Los Angeles-based Capitol Studios from October to December the same year.

In May 2005, after three years and as many scrapped recording sessions, the band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'', fulfilling their contract with [[Sony BMG]]. It followed the path of ''Heathen Chemistry'' as being a collaborative project again, rather than a Noel-written album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/oasis/7660|title=NME news article|date=12 September 2005|work=NME.COM|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-date=26 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226032057/http://www.nme.com/reviews/oasis/7660|url-status=live}}</ref> The album was the first in a decade not to feature drumming by Alan White, marking the recording debut of Starkey.

==Legal battles over songwriter credits==
Legal action has been taken against Noel Gallagher and Oasis for [[plagiarism]] on three occasions. The first was the case of [[Neil Innes]] (formerly of the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] and [[the Rutles]]) suing to prove the Oasis song "[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]" borrowed from his song "How Sweet to Be an Idiot". Innes was eventually awarded royalties and a co-writer credit.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/06/oasis.accused.plagiarism.cliff.richard|title=Have Oasis plagiarised Cliff Richard?|author=Sean Michaels|work=The Guardian|date=6 October 2008|access-date=8 September 2015|archive-date=20 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920053949/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/06/oasis.accused.plagiarism.cliff.richard|url-status=live}}</ref> Noel Gallagher claimed in 2010 that the plagiarism was unintentional and he was unaware of the similarities until informed of Innes's legal case.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Incr7Z3kQ |title=Whatever – 'Time Flies...1994–2009' Clip |publisher=Youtube.com |date=19 May 2010 |access-date=7 February 2011 |archive-date=13 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713070936/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Incr7Z3kQ&feature=related |url-status=live }}</ref> In the second incident, Oasis were sued by [[Coca-Cola]] and forced to pay $500,000 in damages to [[the New Seekers]] after it was alleged that the Oasis song  "[[Shakermaker]]" had lifted words and melody from "[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (in Perfect Harmony)|I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing]]".<ref name="guardian" /> When asked about the incident, Noel Gallagher joked "Now we all drink [[Pepsi]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/oasis/news/artists/8865/55193/55218 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609014904/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/oasis/news/artists/8865/55193/55218 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 June 2010 |title=Oasis &#124; Rolling Stone Music |publisher=Rollingstone.com |access-date=7 February 2011}}</ref> On the third and final occasion, when promotional copies of ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' were originally distributed, they contained a previously unreleased bonus song called "Step Out". This promotional CD was quickly withdrawn and replaced with a version that omitted the controversial song, which was allegedly similar to the [[Stevie Wonder]] song "[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]". Official releases of "Step Out", as the B-side to "[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]" and on ''[[Familiar to Millions]]'', listed "Wonder, et al." as co-writers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rabid |first1=Jack |title=Don't Look Back in Anger |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dont-look-back-in-anger-mw0000071681 |access-date=22 September 2020 |agency=AllMusic |archive-date=26 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126182729/https://www.allmusic.com/album/dont-look-back-in-anger-mw0000071681 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On the flip side, the 2003 song "[[Life Got Cold]]" by UK band [[Girls Aloud]] received attention due to similarities between the guitar riff and melody of the song and that of the Oasis song "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_3168000/3168125.stm | title=Blu secure at number one in midweeks | work=[[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] [[Newsround]] | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=20 August 2003 | access-date=28 February 2009 | archive-date=5 May 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505111334/http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_3168000/3168125.stm | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/10155-girls-aloud-life-got-cold | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417231123/http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/10155-girls-aloud-life-got-cold | url-status=dead | archive-date=17 April 2009 | title=Girls Aloud – Life Got Cold | work=Tourdates.co.uk | date=18 August 2003 | access-date=28 February 2009 }}</ref> A BBC review stated "part of the chorus sounds like it is going to turn into 'Wonderwall' by Oasis."<ref name="bbc">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3051139.stm | title=Girls Aloud trounce pop rivals | work=[[BBC News]] | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=23 May 2003 | access-date=25 February 2008 | first=Ian | last=Youngs | archive-date=9 August 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809132024/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3051139.stm | url-status=live }}</ref> [[Warner/Chappell Music]] has since credited Noel Gallagher as co-songwriter.<ref>{{ cite web|url=http://www.warnerchappell.co.uk/wcmuk/song_search/song_detail/songview.jsp?esongId=852424000 |title=Life Got Cold |work=[[Warner/Chappell Music]] |publisher=[[Warner Music Group]] |access-date=2 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417050011/http://www.warnerchappell.co.uk/wcmuk/song_search/song_detail/songview.jsp?esongId=852424000 |archive-date=17 April 2009 }}</ref>

==Legacy and influence==
Despite parting ways in 2009, Oasis remain hugely influential in British music and culture, and are now recognised as one of the biggest and most acclaimed bands of the 1990s. With their record breaking sales, concerts, sibling disputes, and their [[Britpop#"The Battle of Britpop"|high-profile chart battle]] with Britpop rivals [[Blur (band)|Blur]], Oasis were a major part of 1990s UK pop culture, an era dubbed [[Cool Britannia]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news |title=Belated recognition for Prince Naseem Hamed, the forgotten man of boxing

The band's success also helped local businesses. Pete Caban, owner of Bandwagon Music Supplies in [[Perth, Scotland]], which closed in 2020 after 37 years in business, said: "The highlight years were the mid-90s to the early 2000s. That was the peak period. The Oasis period, as I call it, where everyone wanted to buy a guitar. That was the game changer for music and for me here in Perth.
