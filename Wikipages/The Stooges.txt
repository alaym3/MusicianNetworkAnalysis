'''The Stooges''', originally billed as the '''Psychedelic Stooges''', also known as '''Iggy and the Stooges''', were an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]] in 1967 by singer [[Iggy Pop]], guitarist [[Ron Asheton]], drummer [[Scott Asheton]], and bassist [[Dave Alexander (musician)|Dave Alexander]]. Initially playing a raw, primitive style of [[rock and roll]], the band sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of [[Self-harm|self-mutilation]] by Iggy Pop.<ref name=all/>

After releasing two albums—''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]'' (1969) and ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'' (1970)—the group disbanded briefly, and reformed with a slightly altered lineup (with Ron Asheton replacing Dave Alexander on bass and [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] taking up guitar) to release a third album, ''[[Raw Power]]'' (1973), before breaking up again in 1974. The band reunited in 2003 and played their last shows in 2013. The Stooges formally announced their breakup in 2016 due to the deaths of Scott Asheton and saxophonist [[Steve Mackay]]. Ron Asheton participated in the reunion until his death in 2009.

The Stooges are widely regarded as a seminal [[proto-punk]] act.<ref name=all>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-stooges-mn0000562304/biography | title=The Stooges biography | website=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=July 15, 2015 | last=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine }}</ref><ref name="ult">{{cite web|last=Galluci|first=Michael|title=The Story of the Stooges' Pre-Punk Milestone 'Fun House' |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/stooges-fun-house/|website=Ultimate Guitar|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref><ref name=SIR>{{cite web|title=Anacronistic: The Stooges (Punk Rock)|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2014/12/anachronique-stooges-punk-rock.html|website=Still in Rock (Brooklyn, NY)|access-date=2015-03-31|language=fr|date=1 December 2014}}</ref> The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2009/12/abba_jimmy_cliff_genesis_the_h.html |title=ABBA, Jimmy Cliff, Genesis, the Hollies and the Stooges are headed into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |publisher=cleveland.com |access-date=July 1, 2011}}</ref> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them 78th on their [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]].

==History==
===Formation (1967–68)===
[[Iggy Pop]] (born James Newell Osterberg) played drums in several Ann Arbor-area bands as a teenager, including the Iguanas and, later, [[The Prime Movers (Michigan band)|the Prime Movers]]. The Prime Movers nicknamed Osterberg "Iggy" in reference to his earlier band.<ref name=Mojo29>[[Cliff Jones (musician)|Cliff Jones]] & [[Paul Trynka]] ''Whatever Turns You On'' Mojo No.&nbsp;29, April 1996</ref>

Osterberg was first inspired to form the Stooges after meeting [[blues music|blues]] drummer [[Sam Lay]] during a visit to Chicago. Upon returning to [[Detroit]], Osterberg sought to create a new form of blues music that was not derivative of historical precedents, with influence from garage rock bands [[The Sonics]] and [[The Kinks]]. [[Ron Asheton]] (guitar) and [[Scott Asheton]] (drums) and [[Dave Alexander (musician)|Dave Alexander]] (bass guitar) composed the rest of the band, with Osterberg as main singer. Osterberg became interested in Ron Asheton after seeing him perform in the Chosen Few (a covers band), believing "I’ve never met a convincing musician that didn’t look kind of ill and kind of dirty, and Ron had those two things covered!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/the-stooges-iggy-pop-interview |title=The Stooges: Iggy Pop Interview &#124; Clash Music Exclusive Interview |publisher=Clashmusic.com |date=2010-03-30 |access-date=2011-07-01}}</ref> The three nicknamed Osterberg "Pop" after a local character whom he resembled.<ref name=Mojo161a>Paul Trynka''Meet Ze Monster'' Mojo No.&nbsp;161, April 2007</ref> Shortly after witnessing an [[MC5]] concert in Ann Arbor, Osterberg began using the stage name ''Iggy Pop'', a name that he has used ever since.

Though the Stooges had formed, Iggy Pop attributes two key motivating influences to move the band forward. The first was seeing [[the Doors]] perform at a homecoming dance for the University of Michigan. The second was seeing an all-girls rock band from Princeton, New Jersey called the Untouchable perform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/250986139|title=The Untouchable All-Girl Band|date=13 January 2018}}</ref> In a 1995 interview with Bust Magazine, he relates:

{{quote|I had the Stooges. And we did not have the balls to get out and do it. There were two things that made us do it; one was seeing that show (the Doors), we saw that show and I just thought, well, this is so brazen, there is no excuse for us not to do it anymore. And the other thing was we went to New York. We had gone to New York a couple of months before that just to check out the scene, and we had never been to a place like New York… we went down around Eighth Street there where all the young tourists hang out, and we met these girls from New Jersey, from Princeton, they had a band called the Untouchable, and we’re like, "Oh, you’ve got a band, sure, ha ha ha," and they said "Well, come to our house and see us play." And we didn’t have anywhere to crash, and they played for us, and they completely rocked, and we were really ashamed.}}

The band's 1967 debut  was at their communal State Street house on [[Halloween]] night, followed by their next live gig, January 1968.<ref name="Trynka, Paul 2007"/> During this early period, the Stooges were originally billed as the "Psychedelic Stooges" at the [[Grande Ballroom]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], and other venues, where they played with the band [[MC5]] and others. At one of their early Grande Ballroom performances, Asheton's guitar neck separated from the body forcing the band to stop playing during the opening song, "[[I Wanna Be Your Dog]]". The first major commercial show for the Psychedelic Stooges was on March 3, 1968 at the [[Grande Ballroom]] in Detroit, opening for [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]]. According to [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]] who booked the show, the Psychedelic Stooges were substitutes for the [[MC5]], who had a formidable Detroit reputation that made Blood, Sweat & Tears reluctant to follow them. A fan who saw several of their performances at that time said, "What they achieved was an almost orchestral drone or trance-like sound which was totally unique, valid and impressive."<ref>{{cite book | last = Ambrose| first = Joe| authorlink = | title =Gimme Danger: The Story of Iggy Pop | publisher =Music Sales | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2009 | location = | pages = | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=RwpJFOSyEmEC&q=Psychedelic+Stooges&pg=PT57 | doi = | id = | isbn =9780857120311 | quote=}}</ref>

The group's early sound differed from their later music; critic Edwin Pouncey writes:

{{quote|The Stooges' early musical experiments were more avant garde than punk rock, with Pop incorporating such household objects as a [[vacuum cleaner]] and a [[blender]] into an intense wall of feedback that one observer described as sounding like "an airplane was landing in the room." Homemade instruments were also incorporated to flesh out the overall sound. The 'Jim-a-phone' involved pushing feedback through a funnel device which was raised and lowered to achieve the best effect. There was also a cheap [[Hawaiian guitar]] which Pop and guitarist Ron Asheton would take turns in plucking to produce a simulated [[sitar]] drone, while drummer Scott Asheton pounded away at a set of oil drums with a ball hammer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/125/|last=Pouncey|first=Edwin|title=Motown City Burning: MC5 meets Sun Ra|newspaper=The Wire|issue=136|date=June 1995|access-date=2007-02-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207180711/http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/125/|archive-date=2008-02-07}}</ref>}}

===First two albums and first breakup (1968–71)===
The Stooges soon gained a reputation for their wild, primitive live performances. Pop, especially, became known for his outrageous onstage behavior—smearing his bare chest with hamburger meat and peanut butter, cutting himself with shards of glass, and flashing his genitalia to the audience. Pop is sometimes credited with the invention or popularization of [[stage diving]].

In 1968  [[Elektra Records]] sent DJ/publicist [[Danny Fields]] to scout the MC5, resulting in contracts for both that band and the Stooges. The contracts were at different pay rates: MC5 $20,000, the Stooges $5,000, as revealed in the 2016 [[Jim Jarmusch]] film, ''[[Gimme Danger]]''. In 1969, the band released their [[The Stooges (album)|self-titled debut album]]; sales were low and it was not well received by critics at the time.

In 1970, their second album, ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'', was released, featuring the addition of saxophonist [[Steve Mackay]]. On June 13 of that year, television recorded the band at the [[Cincinnati]] Pop Festival. While performing the songs "T.V. Eye" and "1970", Pop leapt into the crowd, where he was hoisted up on people's hands, and proceeded to smear peanut butter all over his chest. In a broadcast interview at [[WNUR]] [[Northwestern University]] radio station in Evanston, Illinois in 1984, [[Stiv Bators]] of [[the Lords of the New Church]] and [[the Dead Boys]] confirmed the long-standing rumor that it was he who had provided the peanut butter, having carried a large tub from his home in Youngstown, Ohio and handing it up to Iggy from the audience.

''Fun House'' was also poorly received by critics and the general public. Alexander was dismissed in August 1970 after arriving at the [[Goose Lake International Music Festival]] too drunk to play.<ref name=Mojo161b>Keith Cameron ''Return To The Fun House'' Mojo No.&nbsp;161, April 2007</ref> He was replaced by a succession of new bass players, including former roadie [[Zeke Zettner]]<ref name=mojo119>[[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] interview with Iggy Pop Mojo No.&nbsp;199 October 2003</ref> and [[Jimmy Recca|James Recca]]. Around this time, the band expanded their line-up by adding a second guitar player, roadie [[Bill Cheatham]],<ref name=Mojo29/> who was eventually replaced by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]], a childhood friend of the Ashetons and Alexander.

By this time, the Stooges, with the notable exception of Ron Asheton,<ref name=Mojo29/><ref name=Mojo78>Paul Trynka ''Night Of The Iguana'' Mojo No.&nbsp;78, May 2000</ref> had all become serious [[heroin]] users. The drug was introduced to the band by new manager John Adams.<ref name=Mojo29/> Their performances became even more unpredictable, and Pop often had trouble standing up on stage due to his extreme drug abuse. Elektra soon eliminated the Stooges from its roster, and the band had a hiatus for several months. The final line-up was Pop, the Asheton brothers, Recca and Williamson.<ref name=Mojo29/>

The breakup of the Stooges was formally announced on 9 July 1971.<ref name="Iggy Pop Librio">Nicolas Ungemuth, ''Iggy Pop'', Librio Musique / [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]], September 2002</ref>

===''Raw Power'' and second breakup (1972–74)===
With the band having broken up, Pop met [[David Bowie]] on 7 September 1971 at [[Max's Kansas City]],<ref name=Mojo78/><ref name="Iggy Pop Librio"/> and the pair quickly became good friends. The next day, on the advice of Bowie, Pop signed a recording contract with pop music manager [[Tony DeFries]]' company, MainMan. A few months later, Tony DeFries and Pop met [[Clive Davis]] from CBS/[[Columbia Records]] and got a two-album recording deal.<ref name="Iggy Pop Librio"/> In March 1972, DeFries brought Pop and Williamson to the UK,<ref name="Iggy Pop Librio"/> and the pair attempted to reconstitute the Stooges with British musicians, but finding no suitable additions, brought the Asheton brothers back into the band (this "second choice" decision rankled Ron Asheton, as did his change from guitar to bass). This line-up, billed as Iggy & the Stooges, recorded their third album, the influential ''[[Raw Power]]'', which was released in 1973.

At the time, the album faced the criticism that Bowie had mixed it poorly<ref name="berman">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|title=    Iggy and the Stooges - Raw Power [Legacy Editon]|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14125-raw-power-legacy-edition-raw-power-deluxe-edition/|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=April 14, 2010|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> (in subsequent years, various unofficial fan recordings were assembled and released as the album ''[[Rough Power]]'';<ref name="berman"/> in 1997, the album was re-mixed by Iggy Pop and re-released.<ref name="berman"/>) Although the album sold rather poorly and was regarded as a commercial failure at the time of its release, ''Raw Power'' would go on to gain recognition from early [[punk rock]]ers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iggy and the Stooges|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/stooges|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>

With the addition of a piano player (briefly [[Gene Tyranny|Bob Sheff]] and then [[Scott Thurston]]<ref name=Mojo29/>), the Stooges toured for several months, starting in February 1973. Around this time they also made a number of recordings that became known as the ''Detroit Rehearsal Tapes'', including a number of new songs that might have been included on a fourth studio album had the band not been dropped by Columbia soon after the release of ''Raw Power''. In 1973, James Williamson was briefly dismissed due to criticism from the band's management company (likely pertaining to his tempestuous relationship with [[Cyrinda Foxe]], a close friend of road manager [[Leee Black Childers]]); guitarist [[Warren Klein|Tornado Turner]] replaced him for a single gig (on 15 June 1973 at the Aragon Ballroom, [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]<ref name="rockprosopography102 Stooges">{{cite web |url=http://rockprosopography102.blogspot.fr/2010/03/stooges-performance-list-1967-1974.html |title=THE STOOGES FAMILY TREE - SHOWS LIST 1967-1974 |date= 5 March 2010 |website=Blog "Rock Prosopography 102" |access-date= 2015-04-25}}</ref>), but Williamson soon returned to the group.<ref name="Trynka, Paul 2007">Trynka, Paul (2007), "Open Up and Bleed", pg. 152</ref>

The Stooges disbanded in February 1974 as a result of dwindling professional opportunities; this factor was compounded by Pop's ever-present heroin addiction and erratic off-stage behavior.<ref name="Trynka, Paul 2007"/> The last half of the band's last performance of this era on February 9, 1974 in Detroit, Michigan was captured and was released in 1976 as the live album ''[[Metallic K.O.]]'' along with the first half of an earlier show on 6 October 1973 at the same venue. A 1988 expanded release of the album with the title ''Metallic 2X K.O.'' included the two halves of each show. In 1998, the album was re-released under the original title with the order of the shows reversed, (mostly) expanded tracks and more complete set-lists.

===Post-breakup (1975–2003)===
[[File:Iggy-Pop 1977.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Iggy Pop on October 25, 1977, at the State Theatre, Minneapolis, Minnesota]]
After his first attempt at drug rehabilitation, Pop began a volatile yet ultimately successful solo career in 1977, commencing with the Bowie-produced albums ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)|Lust for Life]]'' (1977). Relocated to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Ron Asheton formed the short-lived band [[The New Order (band)|the New Order]] (not to be confused with the UK band [[New Order (band)|New Order]]) with Stooges alumni Recca and Thurston before performing with the Ann Arbor-based "anti-rock" group [[Destroy All Monsters (band)|Destroy All Monsters]] from 1977 to 1985. Until the Stooges' reformation, he supported himself as a working musician in various ensembles, including [[New Race]], Dark Carnival and the Empty Set. Williamson worked with Pop as a producer and engineer during his early solo career – the ''[[Kill City]]'' and ''[[New Values]]'' albums are a product of this collaboration – but began a long break from the music industry in favor of a career in [[electronics engineering]] beginning in 1980. He received his degree from [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] in 1982 and retired from [[Sony]] as vice president of technical standards in 2009. Scott Asheton performed with [[Sonic's Rendezvous Band]] and the Scott Morgan Group while pursuing various day jobs. Dave Alexander died of [[pulmonary edema]] related to his alcohol-induced [[pancreatitis]] in 1975.

In 1997, a reissue of ''[[Raw Power]]'' remixed by Pop was released. In 1999, re-issue label [[Rhino Handmade]] released the seven disc box set ''[[1970: The Complete Fun House Sessions]]'', composed of the entire recording sessions associated with the ''Fun House'' album. 3,000 copies were pressed, selling out in less than a year.

In 2000, indie rock music veterans [[J Mascis]] (of [[Dinosaur Jr]]) and [[Mike Watt]] (of the [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]] and [[Firehose (band)|Firehose]]) teamed with Ron Asheton and drummer George Berz to perform Stooges covers (and other material) live. Billed as J. Mascis and the Fog, the band performed sporadically before Pop became aware of them in 2003.

===Reunion and Ron Asheton's death (2003–09)===
Pop and the Ashetons first reunited that year, sharing four songs on the ''[[Skull Ring]]'' album with Pop on vocals, Scott Asheton on drums, and Ron Asheton on both guitar and bass. Soon afterward, the Stooges reunited officially, performing a series of live shows in the United States and Europe, with Watt on bass at Ron Asheton's request,<ref name="Mike Watt Interview">[http://crasierfrane.blogspot.com/2009/12/mike-watt-interview.html Mike Watt Interview] Clark, Alistair. "Mike Watt Interview", ''Crasier Frane''. Retrieved 2009-12-16.</ref> and ''Fun House''-era saxophonist Steve Mackay. Their Detroit homecoming show, postponed by the [[2003 North America blackout]], was released as the DVD ''[[Live in Detroit (The Stooges album)|Live in Detroit]]''.

On August 16, 2005, [[Elektra Records]] and [[Rhino Records]] issued newly remastered 2-CD editions of the first two Stooges albums, featuring the original album on disc one and outtakes (including alternate mixes, single versions, etc.) on disc two. Unlike the 1997 ''Raw Power'' reissue, which was a total remix from the original multitracks, these remasters are faithful to the original mixes.

[[File:Iggy and the Stooges - Sziget Fesztivál, 2006.08.15 (6).jpg|thumb|Iggy and the Stooges – Sziget Fesztivál, 2006.]]
In 2007, the band released an album of all-new material, ''[[The Weirdness]]'', with [[Steve Albini]] recording, and mastering done at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in [[London, England]].<ref name="albini">[http://entertainment.news.com.au/story/0,10221,17937566-39917,00.html News.com.au interview with Iggy Pop, accessed January 2006].</ref>  The album received mixed to negative reviews from the press. The band also contributed a cover of [[Junior Kimbrough]]'s "You Better Run" to a tribute album for the late blues artist.

The Stooges were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/99-stooges |title=Stooges |publisher=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends |access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>

The Stooges spent the years between 2003 and 2008 touring extensively, playing shows on five different continents. Highlights included performances at several events involved with the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] concert series, Pop's 60th birthday on the stage of [[San Francisco]]'s Warfield Theater,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stuckbetweenstations.org/2007/04/23/the-iguana-at-60/ |title=The Iguana at 60 |publisher=Stuck Between Stations |date=2007-04-23 |access-date=2015-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107054014/http://stuckbetweenstations.org/2007/04/23/the-iguana-at-60/ |archive-date=2015-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> touring with the [[Lollapalooza]] festival, and a performance of two [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] covers at the Michigan-born singer's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in protest of the Stooges' failure to receive an induction into said institution despite six nominations. (Two years later, the band was successfully inducted.)  A low of this touring era occurred in the August 2008 when the band's equipment was stolen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].<ref name="stoogesgeartheft">{{cite web|author=Mike Watt |url=http://www.hootpage.com/stoogesstolenstuff/stoogesstolenstuff.html |title=Stooges stuff stolen on August 4, 2008 in Montreal, Quebec |publisher=Hootpage.com |date=2008-08-04 |access-date=2013-05-04}}</ref>  Initially, the reunited band's sets consisted solely of material from ''The Stooges'', ''Fun House'', ''Skull Ring'', and ''The Weirdness''. By 2008, they had added "[[Search and Destroy (The Stooges song)|Search and Destroy]]", "I Got a Right" and "Raw Power" to their set lists. The band's final show with Ron Asheton was on September 29, 2008, in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]].

On January 6, 2009, Ron Asheton was found dead in his home, having reportedly suffered a heart attack several days earlier.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Daniel Kreps |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/01/06/the-stooges-guitarist-ron-asheton-found-dead-at-60/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107091557/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/01/06/the-stooges-guitarist-ron-asheton-found-dead-at-60/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 7, 2009 |title=The Stooges Guitarist Ron Asheton Found Dead At 60 &#124; Rolling Stone Music |magazine=Rollingstone.com |date=2009-01-06 |access-date=2011-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.kerrang.com/2009/01/rip_ron_asheton_19482009.html |title=Kerrang!

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted the band through their Class of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/37395-the-stooges-abba-inducted-into-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/ |title=The Stooges, ABBA Inducted Into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |website=Pitchfork |date=15 December 2009 |access-date=2011-07-01}}</ref>  The band had previously been nominated for election seven times, each unsuccessful.

On June 22, 2016, guitarist Williamson made an official statement for the band saying that the Stooges are no more.<blockquote>The Stooges is over. Basically, everybody's dead except Iggy and I. So it would be sort-of ludicrous to try and tour as Iggy and the Stooges when there's only one Stooge in the band and then you have side guys. That doesn't make any sense to me.</blockquote>Williamson also added that touring had become boring, and trying to balance the band's career as well as Pop's was a difficult task.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/81665-james-williamson-the-stooges-are-no-more/|title=James Williamson: The Stooges are no more|date=June 23, 2016|website=The List|access-date=June 23, 2016}}</ref>

==Legacy==
*Several punk bands took their names from Stooges songs or lyrics including: [[Radio Birdman]], [[Penetration (band)|Penetration]], [[Raw Power (band)|Raw Power]], [[Shake Appeal]] and The Streetwalkin' Cheetahs
*Music journalist [[Lester Bangs]] was one of the first writers to champion the Stooges in a national publication. His piece "Of Pop and Pies and Fun" for ''[[Creem|Creem Magazine]]'' was published about the time of the Stooges' second album ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]''. Another music journalist, [[Legs McNeil]], was especially fond of Iggy and the Stooges and championed them in many of his writings.
*The [[Sex Pistols]] recorded the first high-profile Stooges cover, "No Fun", in 1976. This introduced the Stooges to a new generation of audiences, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]], where Pop was then based. [[Sid Vicious]] also regularly performed "I Wanna Be Your Dog", "Search and Destroy" and "Shake Appeal (Tight Pants)" in his post-Pistols solo shows. The first two of these songs also feature on his ''[[Sid Sings]]'' album.
*According to [[Dee Dee Ramone]], the members of the [[Ramones]] felt alienated from their community growing up, and started hanging out with each other due to a common love of Stooges, a band everyone else they knew greatly disliked. A typical social experience was listening to the Stooges together while miming/imitating a performance by Iggy Pop.<ref>{{cite AV media | people= Fields, Jim and Gramaglia, Michael| date= 2003| title= [[End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones|End of the Century]]| trans-title= The Story of the Ramones| medium= Motion Picture| location=United States | publisher=Magnolia Pictures}}</ref> [[Joey Ramone| Joey Ramone's]] cover of the song "1969" appeared on his posthumous debut solo album [[Don't Worry About Me]].
