'''Animal Collective''' is an American [[experimental pop]] band formed in [[Baltimore]], Maryland in <!-- Do NOT change to 1999. See talk page. -->2003. Its members and founders are [[Avey Tare]] (David Portner), [[Panda Bear (musician)|Panda Bear]] (Noah Lennox), [[Deakin (musician)|Deakin]] (Josh Dibb), and [[Geologist (musician)|Geologist]] (Brian Weitz). The band's music is characterized by [[studio experimentation]], [[vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]], and an exploration of various genres which include [[freak folk]], [[noise rock]], [[ambient drone]], and [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]].<ref name=allmusic_bio>{{cite web|last1=Monger|first1=James Christopher|title=Animal Collective - Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/animal-collective-mn0000919603/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 2, 2015}}</ref> Records released under the name "Animal Collective" may include contributions from any or all of its members.

Retrieved on July 5, 2010.</ref> After the eighth grade, Lennox went away to a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] high school in [[Pennsylvania]], while Dibb enrolled at [[Park School of Baltimore|The Park School of Baltimore]], where David Portner had studied since grade school. In 1993, Brian Weitz moved from [[Philadelphia]] to [[Baltimore County]] and began attending Park as well, becoming friends with Portner.<ref name="city paper" /> According to Lennox, they attended "progressive" schools that emphasized creativity, imagination and artistic self-expression as part of "a complete kind of education".<ref name="mother nature">[http://reynoldsretro.blogspot.com/2009/01/animal-collective-feels-directors-cut.html MOTHER NATURE'S SONS: Animal Collective and Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti] by Simon Reynolds, The Wire, 2005</ref> Weitz and Portner started playing music together at the age of fifteen because of their shared love of the band [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] and horror movies. Their musical range included cover songs by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] and [[The Cure]] as well as the songs "[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]" by [[Bell Biv DeVoe]] and "[[Seasons In The Sun]]" by [[Terry Jacks]].<ref name="wheeter post"/>

When Portner and Weitz met Dibb later in high school, they started an indie rock band called Automine with schoolmates Brendan Fowler (a.k.a. [[BARR]]) and David Shpritz, being the only ones they knew who wrote their own songs. "We [once] set up a show with four bands—bands that were different formations of us", Portner remembered in an interview with ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]''. At that time, the group did not have any contact to the music scene in Baltimore and "was more about the back porch."<ref name="city paper" /> In 1995, Automine self-released their first and only record, the 7-inch-single ''Paddington Band''. Around that time, they also had their first experiences with psychedelic drugs like [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and started to improvise while playing music.<ref name="wheeter post" />

The four started to discover psychedelic and experimental music like Noggin, as well as [[krautrock]]-related bands such as [[Silver Apples]] and [[Can (band)|Can]]. Meanwhile, Dibb had introduced Lennox to Portner and Weitz, and the four of them began playing music in different group lineups (and often solo), producing several home recordings and swapping them and sharing ideas. Using a drum machine for the first time, Weitz and Portner started a duo called Wendy Darling, whose sound was inspired by soundtracks of horror movies like ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', especially [[György Ligeti]] and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]].<ref name="wheeter post"/><ref name="mother nature" />

In 1997, Lennox and Dibb both went off to college in the Boston area ([[Boston University]] and [[Brandeis University]]), while Portner and Weitz attended schools in New York City ([[NYU]] and [[Columbia University]]).<ref name="city paper" /> Lennox and Dibb assembled Lennox's debut album, ''[[Panda Bear (album)|Panda Bear]]'', during this time from the [[multitude]] of [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] Lennox had made in the previous years and established their own label, [[Paw Tracks|Soccer Star Records]], to release it.

====''Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished''====
{{Main|Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished}}

Abhorring the new life as a student at NYU, Portner, along with Weitz, returned to Maryland every summer to meet Lennox and Dibb and play music together. At that time Portner was also working on a record, which would eventually become ''[[Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished]]''. Portner asked Lennox to play drums on the record and they recorded them along with piano and acoustic guitars in the summer of 1999. The rest of the year, Portner returned to Maryland on weekends to record overdubs and finish the mixing.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=20827&highlight=#20827 |title=Questions for the Collective~ Several Questions |publisher=Collected Animals |year=2006 |authors =post by Dave Portner under the username "wheeter" |access-date=April 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171602/http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=20827&highlight= |archive-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> It was finally released in the following summer under the name ''Avey Tare and Panda Bear''. Soccer Star morphed into the Animal label, with the intention of putting out music that came from the four musicians.

In parallel with his environmental policy and marine biology studies, Weitz hosted a noise show at WKCR, Columbia's college radio station. On weekends, he and Portner borrowed avant-garde music records and listened to them all night at Weitz's dorm room which rapidly broadened their musical horizon.<ref name="mother nature" />

In the summer of 2000, the four friends spent several months at Portner's apartment in downtown New York City intensely playing music together using antiquated synthesizers, acoustic guitars, and household objects. According to Lennox, in this summer the basis for all of Animal Collective's later music was created. However, all recordings of this period were stolen when Portner changed apartments and packed up the car the night before he moved.

While studying, Dave Portner organized shows at [[New York University]] for a while. As he had class together with [[Eric Copeland]], he organized a show for his band [[Black Dice]] and eventually became friends with him. In 2000, ''[[Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished]]'' was finished, Lennox and Dibb left school in Boston and moved to New York and the group's music became much more [[collaborative]] in nature. After introducing Lennox to Copeland, Portner and Lennox played their first show together in New York at ''The Cooler'' with Dogg and Pony, [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]] and [[Black Dice]]<ref>[http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/pandabeariw.htm Interview with Panda Bear] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222045759/http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/pandabeariw.htm |date=February 22, 2012 }}, The Milk Factory, April 2005</ref> in late summer of 2000.

This was also the first time they wore makeup and masks, which later became a prominent characteristic of the group's live performances. From there on, Portner wore a mask for the first two years of the group performing. Lennox wore a panda hood on his head and later put face paint on; throughout the Europe tour in early 2004 he wore a white wig and went by the name Edgar. Dibb performed masked during the ''[[Here Comes the Indian]]'' tour. On the Australia tour in November 2006 and inspired by [[Halloween]], they wore masks for the last time.<ref>[http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=103313&highlight=aussie#103313 Collected Animals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929142805/http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=103313&highlight=aussie#103313 |date=September 29, 2011 }} Post by Deakin, January 9, 2008</ref> According to Portner, the reason for disguising was to "help us be more relaxed and find an easier place in that other world we wanted people to join us in."<ref name="Collected Animals">[http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=103168&highlight=flowers+masks#103168 Collected Animals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929142810/http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=103168&highlight=flowers+masks#103168 |date=September 29, 2011 }} Post by Dave Portner under the user name "wheeter", January 9, 2008</ref> They eventually stopped because they felt like it could become "too gimmicky"<ref name="Collected Animals" /> and distract from the music, although Weitz still sports a head lamp at live performances, as he did from the beginning.

====''Danse Manatee'', ''Campfire Songs'', and ''Here Comes the Indian''====
{{Main|Danse Manatee|Campfire Songs (album)|Here Comes the Indian}}

After Portner and Lennox had played clubs around New York in twos, Weitz came on board in the end of 2000 and began performing with them. Much of the live material from this time would eventually end up on ''[[Danse Manatee]]'' (Catsup Plate). ''Danse Manatee'' was released in 2001 under the name of ''Avey Tare, Panda Bear and Geologist''. The trio was also occasionally use the name ''Forest Children'' when performing live during this period.

Notably, the close friendship with [[Black Dice]] has been a major influence throughout the group's career. In the summer of 2001, Black Dice took them as support on their first tour, which was captured on the 2002 live album ''[[Hollinndagain]]''. It was released by St. Ives, a boutique label run by [[Secretly Canadian]] which releases limited edition vinyl only records. Limited to 300 copies, each of which featured a one-of-a-kind handmade cover, ''Hollinndagain'' is among the rarest of Animal Collective artifacts. It was re-released, both on CD and vinyl, on October 31, 2006 through the [[Paw Tracks]] label.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.paw-tracks.com/hollinndagainpresspage.html|title=animal collective "hollinndagain" press page|website=www.paw-tracks.com|access-date=2017-07-25}}</ref>

At this point, Dibb began to perform with the group. The next album to be released was ''[[Campfire Songs (album)|Campfire Songs]]'', again working with Catsup Plate in 2003. The ''Campfire Songs'' concept and some of the material dated back to the earliest Avey Tare and Panda Bear shows in New York. Recorded live in 2001 on Portner's aunt's screened-in porch in [[Monkton, Maryland]], the record is one take of five songs played straight through.<ref name="city paper" /> Attempting to make a record as warm and inviting as a [[campfire]], the band recorded their performance straight to [[minidisc]], with one recorder outside to grab the ambient sound of the environment. Field recordings of the surrounding area were also added. The original album is out of print but Paw Tracks reissued it on January 26, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paw-tracks.com/news.html |title=news |publisher=paw tracks |access-date=August 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810010426/http://paw-tracks.com/news.html |archive-date=August 10, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After this recording session they started to work on new material which was later released on ''[[Here Comes the Indian]]'' and they were faced with some serious problems within the group. In early 2002, they went on their first big tour which took them to the South of the US and turned out to be "pretty brutal{{nbsp}}...". "We all lost our minds on that tour", Portner recalls.<ref name="mother nature" /> Right before their next tour in summer, Weitz got the message that he was accepted to his first choice graduate school in Arizona. After three chaotic days on the road with their tour van breaking down, equipment getting damaged bundled with a lack of money, the tour was about to be cancelled. "At that point we all knew we'd get back from tour, record the songs, and then we needed space from each other, and we still had more than 2 weeks left on the road", Weitz said on the Collected Animals message board.<ref name="veyesor post">{{Citation |url=http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=16347&highlight=job#16347 |title=Questions for the Collective~ Not on Albums |publisher=Collected Animals |year=2006 |authors =post by Brian Weitz under the username "veyesor" |access-date=April 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171625/http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=16347&highlight=job |archive-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

Worrying that ''Avey Tare, Panda Bear, Deakin and Geologist'' would be too long-winded a moniker, and with record companies advising that a unifying name would be necessary for the marketplace, the group decided to adopt a catch-all name. Using their old label of Animal as inspiration they picked "Animal Collective". This formation was to be different from a straightforward band, giving the musicians the freedom to work in combinations of two to four, as dictated by the project at hand or their mood. Their first entry under this name was ''[[Here Comes the Indian]]'', which was released in 2003 by their newly formed record label, Paw Tracks, formed with Carpark Records' Todd Hyman. Animal Collective makes decisions on what Paw Tracks is to release, while Hyman runs the day-to-day operations. The group was happy to find someone like Hyman, who had experience running a label and was dedicated to the group's music; the Animal label was more or less abandoned upon the formation of Paw Tracks. ''Here Comes the Indian'' was the first record to feature all four of Animal Collective.

After the two releases in 2003 attracted much attention, [[Black Dice]] introduced the group to the [[Fat Cat Records]] label which eventually ended up with the group beginning a relationship with their new admirers. The first Fat Cat release from the Collective was a double disc package of ''Spirit They've Gone, Spirit They've Vanished'' and ''Danse Manatee.''

====''Sung Tongs'', ''Feels'', and ''Strawberry Jam''====
{{Main|Sung Tongs|Feels (album)|Strawberry Jam}}

[[File:Animalcollective1.jpg|thumb|Animal Collective performing live on December 27, 2006. (left to right: Avey Tare, Geologist, Panda Bear.)]]

After the dense soundscapes of ''Here Comes the Indian'', Portner and Lennox decided to concentrate on more stripped-down material. Each of them began composing material and they performed as a duo usually with just acoustic guitars, a single drum, some effects and their voices. The duo toured the world for the better part of a year with this new material, opening for [[múm]] and [[Four Tet]] among others, before retreating to Lamar, Colorado to record the material with [[Rusty Santos]], a New York musician and friend. The result was ''[[Sung Tongs]]'', released on [[Fat Cat Records]] in 2004 to critical acclaim.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs/|title=Animal Collective: Sung Tongs Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-25}}</ref>

In the meantime, Brian Weitz returned from Arizona and he and Josh Dibb joined the duo again. All four started writing new songs together which finally ended up on their 2005 release ''[[Feels (album)|Feels]]''. Animal Collective, as the duo of Panda Bear & Deakin (a.k.a. Noah's Ark), toured in Japan for the first time in February 2004 with Carpark Records' artists [[Greg Davis (musician)|Greg Davis]] & Ogurusu Norihide. In early 2004, they started touring with their regular setlists including exclusively post-''Sung-Tongs'' material, except for "We Tigers" and "Who Could Win a Rabbit?", which have been performed regularly up to the present. During their Europe tour, the group was introduced to [[Vashti Bunyan]] in Edinburgh, Scotland by [[Kieran Hebden]] (AKA Four Tet), who had recently played in Bunyan's band. Being fans of the cult folk singer's 1970 album ''[[Just Another Diamond Day]]'', the group had dinner with Bunyan and asked her to collaborate on some recordings. The group encouraged her to sing lead vocals on three songs left over from the ''Sung Tongs'' era, released on the ''[[Prospect Hummer]]'' EP in early 2005. Weitz, who had started a day job in early 2004, could not join this tour and therefore missed the recording session with Bunyan, but contributed one instrumental song to the EP.<ref name="veyesor post" />

Spring of 2005 saw the group refining soon to be released ''Feels'' material while on tour''.'' The spring tour included performances at small to mid-sized venues such as BAR Nightclub in New Haven, Connecticut and the [[Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City. Colleges and universities throughout the northeast United States also held concerts, including [[Middlebury College]], [[Bennington College]] and [[State University of New York at Purchase]]. Ariel Pink supported as an opening act for the tour and Animal Collective's sets were well received as the buzz around the band slowly increased.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/animal-collective-6bd69a76.html?page=57|title=Animal Collective Concert Setlists (page 57)|website=setlist.fm|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>

In October 2005, Animal Collective released their sixth studio album, ''[[Feels (album)|Feels]]'', recorded in Seattle with [[Climax Golden Twins]]' Scott Colburn, known for his work with the [[Sun City Girls]]. Following the release of ''Feels'', Animal Collective mounted their most extensive tour, which lasted into the Fall of 2006 and saw them visit Australia and New Zealand for the first time in addition to many European festivals and North American dates, including a headline set in the Carling Tent at the [[Reading and Leeds festival]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.readingfestival.com/sites/live.inviqa.readingfestival.com/files/images/history/poster/2006.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621000633/http://www.readingfestival.com/sites/live.inviqa.readingfestival.com/files/images/history/poster/2006.jpg |archive-date=June 21, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the summer of 2006, Dibb's father died, which led to a show breakup after only two songs at [[Rock Herk]] Festival on July 15.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=19322&highlight=belgium |title=Live Discussion~ Animal Collective @ Rock Herk |publisher=Collected Animals |year=2006 |authors =posts by user "catterpillarstrangle", Brian Weitz under the username "veyesor", and Josh Dibb under the username "deakin" |access-date=April 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171641/http://rerz.net/ac/messages/viewtopic.php?p=19322&highlight=belgium |archive-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref>

In the late fall of 2006, Animal Collective released ''[[People (Animal Collective EP)|People]]'' in Australia as a 7" on their Australian label Spunk Records, and worldwide as a 12" and CD [[Extended play|EP]] in early 2007 on FatCat Records.

In January 2007, Domino Recording Company announced that they would be releasing the new, then still unnamed, Animal Collective album.

The band toured extensively throughout 2007, completing several American and European tours. Beginning in May 2007 the band debuted a brand new batch of post-''Strawberry Jam'' live songs. These songs were written in an intense two-week session before the tour, months before the release of ''Strawberry Jam''. On October 5, 2007, the band, in its full four-man line up (as opposed to its three-man lineup performances in 2007 and 2008) made their national television debut on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]] performing the song "#1" in support of ''Strawberry Jam''.

Starting with their first tour dates in early 2009, the band introduced a new song, "What Would I Want? Sky". This song was also part of a BBC Session recording, and the May 2009 tour saw the debut of "Bleed" - both of these songs would later be included on their ''[[Fall Be Kind]]'' EP. On May 7, the band made their second television appearance, on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]], performing the single "[[Summertime Clothes]]" from ''Merriweather Post Pavilion''. The appearance included the regular three-man lineup indicative of their 2007–2009 tours, which excluded Josh Dibb. Four dancers draped in sheets also appeared on-stage behind the band, a first in their live performances. The video accompanied the release of the single on July 7, 2009, also featuring remixes by Zomby (Hyperdub), Dâm-Funk (Stones Throw), and L.D. In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Portner announced the last single from the album would be "[[Brother Sport]]", which was released November 9 on vinyl with the live B-side "Bleeding".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/36749-animal-collective-to-release-brothersport-single/|title=Animal Collective to Release &quot;Brothersport&quot; Single {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|date=October 8, 2009|language=en|access-date=2017-07-25}}</ref>

====''ODDSAC''====
{{Main|ODDSAC}}

For four years, the band had been working on ''[[ODDSAC]]'', a visual record, with Danny Perez, who directed music videos for the band's "[[Who Could Win a Rabbit]]" and "[[Summertime Clothes]]" singles. The movie featured visuals which were developed and edited simultaneously with the music they recorded for it. Panda Bear stated they would like to "create a movie that would have visuals similar to what somebody would see if they closed their eyes while listening to Animal Collective's music". Weitz further added that "it's the most experimental stuff we've ever done." According to Portner, "Maybe here and there, in our minds, there's some weird narratives going on. The whole thing cohesively doesn't have one narrative; it's more of a visual or psychedelic thing. There are parts that are almost completely abstract, and there are parts that are little bit more live-action."

The film premiered at the 2010 [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 26.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Animal Collective's "Oddsac" Debuts at Sundance |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/animal-collectives-oddsac-debuts-at-sundance-20100127 |date=January 27, 2010 |access-date=April 14, 2013}}</ref> ''[[ODDSAC]]'' was screened in theaters in North America and Europe in spring 2010, followed by a DVD release in August.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oddsac.com/ |title=ODDSAC |publisher=ODDSAC |access-date=August 18, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830051954/http://www.oddsac.com/ |archive-date=August 30, 2010 |url-status= live}}</ref>

About the word "Animal" in their name, Panda Bear said,

<blockquote>It sounds kind of lame, but we're all really big fans of animals. At the time, we were thinking along the lines of animals as beings that act purely instinctually ... kind of the opposite of a "collective" in that way. Musically, it was about not making decisions based on knowledge or reason. We wanted to work with music on an emotional level, not on an intellectual level. That's where it comes from.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicbeats.net/wheres-your-lord-glenn-obrien-talks-to-panda-bear/|title="Where's your Lord?": Glenn O'Brien talks to Panda Bear – Telekom Electronic Beats|last=Telekom|date=December 9, 2013|website=electronicbeats.net}}</ref></blockquote>
