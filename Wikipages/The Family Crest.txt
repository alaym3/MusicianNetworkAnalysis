==History==

The brainchild of frontman Liam McCormick, The Family Crest began as a recording project in 2008 that aimed to connect a community of people through a musical platform. Using flyers, personal contacts, [[Craigslist]] and other forms of outreach, McCormick and co-founder John Seeterlin recorded nearly 100 people for the project throughout Northern California.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Pearson: The Family Crest - The Interview|url=http://paul-pearson.blogspot.com/2012/03/family-crest-interview.html|publisher=www.paulpearson.blogspot.com|accessdate=16 May 2012|date=March 8, 2012}}</ref>  After completing the majority of recording in the fall of 2009, McCormick and Seeterlin elected to continue the project by forming a live band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deborahcrooks.blogspot.com/2010/11/artist-interview-family-crests-liam.html |title=Bird in the Tree: Artist Interview: The Family Crest's Liam McCormick: |publisher=Deborahcrooks.blogspot.com |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref>

==Style==

Though the band identifies themselves as an 'orchestral indie rock' band, their sound is inspired by many genres including [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[Classical music|classical]]. Kimberly Chun of the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] states that "The Family Crest harbors an affection for Burt Bacharach-style swingin' romanticism that is sure to impress lovers of classic pop."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/20/NSM71H89QG.DTL |title=Bay Area weekend music picks, Jan. 20-23 |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2011-01-20 |accessdate=2012-03-31 |first=Kimberly |last=Chun}}</ref>

==Albums==

The band self-released their debut EP, ''Songs From the Valley Below'', in February 2010, the same day that they debuted as a live band.  On May 19, 2011, they reissued a remixed and remastered version of ''Songs From the Valley Below''.

On January 22, 2011, The Family Crest released a limited local release of their debut LP, ''The Village.''  ''The Village'' was funded in part by a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign, in which the band exceeded their $10,000 goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madeloud.com/articles/miscellaneous/kickstarter-where-modest-dreams-can-still-come-true |title=Kickstarter: Where Modest Dreams Can Still Come True - Miscellaneous - Articles &#124; Indie Articles & Reviews |publisher=MadeLoud |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> On May 1, 2012, ''The Village'' was self-released nationally.
