{{Short description|Arabic name suffix}}{{lowercase}}
'''Ad-Din''' ({{lang-ar|الْدِّين}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ad-[[dīn]]&nbsp;}}'' '(of) the Religion/Faith/Creed'), a suffix component of some [[Arabic name]]s, meaning 'the religion/faith/creed', e.g. Saif al-Din ({{lang-ar|سيف الدّين|Sayf al-Dīn|Sword of the Faith}}). Varieties are also used in non-Arabic names throughout the Muslim world.

The Arabic spelling in its standard transliteration is {{Lang|ar-latn|ad-Din}}'','' due to the phonological rules involving "[[Sun and moon letters|sun letter]]" ({{Lang|ar|حرف الشّمسيّة}} {{Lang|ar-latn|hurfu ’sh-Shamsiyyah}}), the Arabic letter {{Lang|ar|د}} ({{Lang|ar-latn|dāl}}) is assimilated letter of the ِ[[Arabic definite article]] {{Lang|ar|ال}} ({{Lang|ar-latn|al}}). The first noun of [[Arabic grammar#iḍāfah|the compound]] must have the ending -''u'' which according to the assimilation rules in Arabic – names in general is in the nominative case, assimilates the following ''a''-, thus manifesting into {{Lang|arb-latn|ud-Din}} in [[Classical Arabic|Classical]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]].

However, all the modern Arabic vernaculars lack the noun endings, thus the vowel of the definite article in them is pronounced in full as either ''a'' or ''e'' (the latter mostly in [[Maghreb]] and Egypt). At the same time the Arabic short vowel ''u'' is rendered as short ''o'' in Persian, thus {{Lang|fa-latn|od-din}}.

So in practice romanizations of Arabic names containing this element may vary greatly, including:
* {{Lang|ar-latn|al-Din}}, {{Lang|ar-latn|ad-Din}}, {{Lang|ar-latn|-addin}}, {{Lang|ar-latn|-adin}}
* {{Lang|ar-latn|el-Din}}, {{Lang|ar-latn|-eldin}}, {{Lang|ar-latn|-eddin}}
* {{Lang|ar-latn|ud-Din}}, {{Lang|ar-latn|-uddin}} (particularly in [[English language|English]]-speaking [[South Asia|South]] and [[East Asia]]), {{Lang|ar-latn|-uddeen}} (particularly in English-speaking South and East Asia)
* {{Lang|ar-latn|-eddine}} (particularly in [[French language|French]]-speaking areas)
* {{Lang|ar-latn|-ettin}} (particularly in [[Turkish name]]s)
* {{Lang|ar-latn|-od-din}} (particularly in [[Persian name]]s)
