==Career==
The band began as Jeckell and The Hydes in [[New Jersey]] in 1966.  The original  members were Frank Jeckell, Mark Gutkowski, Floyd Marcus, Pat Karwan and Steve Mortkowitz - all from [[Linden, New Jersey]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/><ref>Voger, Mark. [https://www.nj.com/entertainment/2014/02/1910_fruitgum_company_simon_says.html "1910 Fruitgum Company: From Linden to the Top 10"], NJ Advance Media for [[NJ.com]], February 28, 2014, updated March 29, 2019. Accessed November 25, 2019. "Jeckell's fellow founding members were Mark Gutkowski (lead vocals, keyboards), Pat Karwan (guitar), Steve Mortkowitz (bass), and Floyd Marcus (drums).... And so five young men from Linden with aspirations to be the next Vanilla Fudge scored a Top 10 hit ... with a bubblegum song."</ref>

During 1967, they were signed to [[Buddah Records]], where they released five [[gramophone record|LPs]] under their own name and a variety of [[single (music)|singles]], as well as appearing on the LP ''The Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus'', which sounded like the usual Buddah [[recording studio|studio]] band in spite of its promotion as a "bubblegum superjam". Their first hit single, "Simon Says", was written by Elliot Chiprut. During the recording process, the band changed the beat and patterned the song after "[[Wooly Bully]]" by [[Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs]]. "Simon Says" soon became a success, hitting #4 on the [[United States|US]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]].  The track peaked at #2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book
