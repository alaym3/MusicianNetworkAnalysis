'''Pit bull''' is a term used in the [[United States]] for a [[Dog type|type of dog]] descended from [[bulldog]]s and [[terrier]]s, while in other countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] the term is used as an abbreviation of the [[American Pit Bull Terrier]] breed.{{r|Hoffman|Oxford|Webster}} The term was first used in 1927.{{r|Webster}} Within the United States the pit bull is usually considered a heterogeneous grouping that includes the breeds American Pit Bull Terrier, [[American Staffordshire Terrier]], [[American Bully]], [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]] and occasionally the [[American Bulldog]], along with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical characteristics with these breeds. In other countries including Britain, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is not considered a pit bull.{{r|Hoffman|Olson|Allen}} Most pit bull-type dogs descend from the British [[Bull and terrier]], a 19th century [[Dog fighting|dog-fighting]] type developed from crosses between the [[Old English Bulldog]] and the [[Old English Terrier]].{{r|Fogle|Morris|Beaufoy}}

Pit bull-type dogs have a controversial reputation as pets both in the United States and internationally, due to their history in [[dog fighting]], the number of high-profile attacks documented in the media over decades, and their proclivity to latching on while biting.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-07-03|title=The Most Feared Dogs May Also Be the Most Misunderstood|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2016/07/pit-bull-ban-aggressive-dog-breed-bronwen-dickey/|access-date=2020-08-15|website=National Geographic News|language=en|archive-date=July 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715182806/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2016/07/pit-bull-ban-aggressive-dog-breed-bronwen-dickey/|url-status=live}}</ref> Proponents of the breed and advocates of regulation have engaged in a [[nature-versus-nurture]] debate over whether apparent aggressive tendencies in pit bulls may be appropriately attributed to owners' care for the dog or inherent qualities.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Glazebrook|first=Louise|date=2016-04-13|title=What makes an animal dangerous?

Pit bull-type dogs are extensively used in the United States for dogfighting, a practice that has continued despite being outlawed.{{r|Morris|Kalouf}} A number of nations and jurisdictions restrict the ownership of pit bull-type dogs through [[breed-specific legislation]].{{r|Hoffman|Olson}}

== History ==
[[File:Benjamin Marshall - Dustman - Bulldog and Terrier Mix.jpg|thumb|200px|Early 19th century [[bull and terrier]].]]
It is believed all dogs that are now classified as pit bulls descend from the British [[bull and terrier]], which were first imported into North America in the 1870s.{{r|Fogle|Morris}} The bull-and-terrier was a type of dog developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 19th century for the [[blood sport]]s of [[dog fighting]] and [[rat baiting]], it was created by crossing the ferocious, thickly muscled [[Old English Bulldog]] with the agile, lithe, feisty [[Black and Tan Terrier]].{{r|Fogle|Morris}} The aggressive Old English Bulldog, which was bred for [[bear baiting|bear]] and [[bull baiting]], was often also pitted against its own kind in organised dog fights, but it was found that lighter, faster dogs were better suited to dogfighting than the heavier Bulldog.{{r|Fogle|Morris|Beaufoy}} To produce a lighter, faster more agile dog that retained the courage and tenacity of the Bulldog, outcrosses from local terriers were tried, and ultimately found to be successful.{{r|Fogle|Morris|Beaufoy}}

As it was in the United Kingdom, dog fighting became a popular pastime in 19th century America and bull-and-terriers were imported to the New World to pursue the blood sport.{{r|Fogle|Morris}} In the United States organised dog fights have been progressively outlawed in various states since 1874, culminating in federal legislation criminalising animal fighting in 2007.{{r|Kalouf}}

In the 1890s breeders of American pit bull-type dogs attempted to have their dogs recognised by the [[American Kennel Club]], but because of the type’s association with dogfighting, the club rejected these entreaties.{{r|Fogle|Morris}} Following this rejection, in 1898 breeders of [[American Pit Bull Terrier]]s established a rival [[kennel club]], the [[United Kennel Club]]. In addition to being a breed registry, the United Kennel Club also regulated dogfights.{{r|Fogle|Morris|Wilcox}} In the 1930s the American Kennel Club was faced with a dilemma, whilst not wishing to condone dogfighting there was a desire to recognise a uniquely American dog breed for which over 30 years of breed records existed.{{r|Fogle|Morris|Wilcox}} The solution was to recognise Pit Bull Terriers under a different name and prohibit these dogs from being used in organised fights and in 1935 the American Kennel Club recognised Pit Bull Terriers as Staffordshire Terriers.{{r|Fogle|Morris|Wilcox}}

The name "[[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]]" was first used in Britain in 1930 in advertisements for bull-and-terrier-type dogs.{{r|Beaufoy}} Organised dog fighting had been effectively eliminated in the United Kingdom by the [[Protection of Animals Act 1911]], but devotees of the bull-and-terrier type continued to breed these dogs, predominantly in England's [[Black Country]].{{r|Beaufoy}} Throughout the early 1930s attempts were made in England to gain recognition for these dogs with [[The Kennel Club]], these efforts were successful in 1935.{{r|Fogle|Morris|Kalouf}} In order to avoid confusion with the British breed, in 1972 the American Kennel Club changed the name of their American breed to the [[American Staffordshire Terrier]].{{r|Morris|Wilcox}}

Despite criminalisation, illegal fights using pit bull-type dogs have continued to be widespread in the United States, in the 1990s in that country it was estimated 1,500 dogs died annually in organised fights and by the mid-2000s it was estimated over 40,000 people were involved in the illegal blood sport.{{r|Fogle|Morris|Kalouf}} Pit bull-type dogs are also used by criminal organisations to guard illegal narcotics, and to intimidate and attack civilians, other criminals and police, the type becoming a status symbol in American [[gang culture]].{{r|Kalouf}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Cook|first=Frank|title=Pit bulls becoming drug dealers weapon of preference|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/06/29/Pit-bulls-becoming-drug-dealers-weapon-of-preference/6208551937600|date=June 29, 1987|publisher=United Press International|access-date=December 21, 2019|archive-date=December 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221182621/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/06/29/Pit-bulls-becoming-drug-dealers-weapon-of-preference/6208551937600/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Al |last1=Baker |first2=Mathew R. |last2=Warren |title=Shooting highlights the risks dogs pose to police, and vice versa |date=July 9, 2009 |place=New York, NY |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/nyregion/10pitbull.html |access-date=January 7, 2010 |archive-date=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116022218/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/nyregion/10pitbull.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On the other side of the law, pit bull-type dogs have been used by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] as [[drug detection dog]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |date=October 2002 |title=Cool K-9 Popsicle retires |journal=U.S. Customs Today |volume=38 |issue=#10 |url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/CustomsToday/2002/October/k9.xml |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024001344/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/CustomsToday/2002/October/k9.xml |archive-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Adrienne Mand |last=Lewin |title=Protecting the Nation — One Sniff at a Time |date=October 12, 2005 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Terrorism/story?id=1200304&page=1 |access-date=February 2, 2009 |archive-date=March 22, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322183804/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Terrorism/story?id=1200304&page=1 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A 2020 literature review in ''Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery'' found that from 1971 to 2018 of all pure breed dogs in the United States, pit bull-type breeds were second, behind the [[German Shepherd]], and ahead of [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]]s, [[Chow Chow]]s, and [[Rottweiler]]s (in that order) for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment. The study found that the proportion of bites caused by German Shepherds decreased by 0.63 percent per year over that time interval while the proportion caused by pit bulls increased by 1.17 percent per year.

=== Breed-specific legislation ===
{{Main|Breed-specific legislation}}

Widely reported pit bull attacks have resulted in the enactment of [[breed-specific legislation]] (BSL) in several jurisdictions.

== Commercial restrictions ==

=== Liability insurance ===
Dog owners in the United States can be held [[Legal liability|legally liable]] for injuries inflicted or caused by their dogs. In general, owners are considered liable if they were unreasonably careless in handling or restraining the dog, or if they knew beforehand that the dog had a tendency to cause injury (e.g., bite); however, dog owners are automatically considered liable if local laws hold an owner [[Strict liability|strictly liable]] for all damage caused by their dog, regardless of carelessness or foreknowledge of a dog's tendencies. Homeowners and renters [[insurance]] policies typically provide liability coverage from US$100,000–300,000 for injuries inflicted by dogs;<ref name="Insurance Information Institute">{{cite web |title=Dog Bite Liability |publisher=[[Insurance Information Institute]] |date=September 2009 |url=http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/dogbite/ |access-date=September 24, 2009 |archive-date=June 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615052434/http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/dogbite/ |url-status=live }}</ref> however, some insurance companies limit their exposure to dog bite liability claims by putting restrictions on dog owners that they insure. These restrictions include refusing to cover dog bites under the insurance policy, increasing insurance rates for homeowners with specific breeds, requiring owners of specific breeds to take special training or have their dogs pass the [[American Kennel Club]] [[Canine Good Citizen]] test,<ref>{{cite web |title=Homeowners Insurance Available to Breeds Previously Excluded with CGC Certification |publisher=[[American Kennel Club]] |date=October 1, 2004 |url=http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=2408 |access-date=February 4, 2009 |archive-date=September 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914051327/http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=2408 |url-status=live }}</ref> requiring owners to restrict their dogs with muzzles, chains, or enclosures, and refusing to write policies for homeowners or renters who have specific breeds of dogs.<ref name="Insurance Information Institute" />

Owners of rental properties may also be held liable if they knew an aggressive dog was living on their property and they did nothing to ensure the safety of other tenants at the property; as a result, many rental properties forbid pit bull-type dogs and any other breeds if the rental property's insurance will not cover damage inflicted by that type of dog. The dog breeds most often not covered by insurance companies include pit bull-type dogs, [[Rottweiler]]s, German Shepherd Dogs, [[Dobermann|Doberman Pinscher]]s, Akitas ([[Akita Inu]] and [[American Akita]]s), and [[Chow Chow]]s.<ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Sodergren |title=Insurance companies unfairly target specific dog breeds |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]] |url=http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/insurance_companies_unfairly_target_specific_dog_breeds.html |access-date=August 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707221314/http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/insurance_companies_unfairly_target_specific_dog_breeds.html |archive-date=July 7, 2009}}</ref>{{better|date=October 2021}}

In 2013, [[Farmers Insurance]] notified policyholders in California that it will no longer cover bites by pit bulls, Rottweilers and [[Wolfdog|wolf-dog hybrid]]s. A spokeswoman for Farmers said that those breeds account for more than a quarter of the agency's dog bite claims.<ref name=Gephardt>Gephardt, Bill.
