== Personal life ==
Kygo was previously in a relationship with Maren Platou and is currently single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv2.no/a/8225494/|title=Kygo bryter tausheten om kjæresten Maren|website=Tv2.no}}</ref> He is a fan of [[Manchester United]], with his favourite player being [[Juan Mata]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ravejungle.com/2016/04/22/djs-and-their-favorite-football-clubs/8/|title=DJs And Their Favorite Football Clubs|website=Ravejungle.com|date=22 April 2016|access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref> He is also a fan of [[Formula One|Formula 1]] and performed a concert at the [[2019 Bahrain Grand Prix]]. He performed at another race in 2021 this time being the [[2021 Mexico City Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]].

== Stage name ==
His [[stage name]] Kygo can be pronounced as ({{IPA-no|kyːɡuː}}<!--Correct if wrong.-->)<ref name="PIAvideo">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1LaRyPy49o| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520151650/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1LaRyPy49o&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=20 May 2019 | url-status=dead|title=THIS IS HOW MUCH VIN DIESEL LOVES KYGO!!|last=Flaa|first=Kjersti|publisher=[[YouTube]]|language=en|access-date=22 May 2017|quote=At the beginning of the interview with American actor [[Vin Diesel]] and Norwegian journalist Kjersti Flaa, Diesel pronounce Gørvell-Dahll's artist name in English and Flaa in Norwegian.}}</ref> for Norwegian speakers and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|ɡ|oʊ}}<ref name="PIAvideo" /> for English speakers. Both pronunciations can be used interchangeably. Kyrre got the idea for his stage name through a [[User (computing)#Username format|username]] he received in [[videregående skole|high school]] for the [[learning management system|digital learning]] platform ''[[itslearning]]''.<ref name="artist name">{{cite web|url=http://www.fanaposten.no/nyheter/kygo-fant-navnet-pa-skoleportal/lgcofm!7f1ae00641624550b7822440402f9c8b/|title=Kygo fant navnet på skoleportal|website=Fanaposten.no}}</ref> The service used parts of his name to create a nickname, thereof "Ky-" standing for the first two letters in his given name "Kyrre" and "-go" for the first two letters in his last name "Gørvell-Dahll". The letter [[ø]] is usually replaced with letter [[o]] in [[computing]]. In an interview with newspaper ''[[Fanaposten]]'', Kyrre quoted; "Kygo [as an artist name] has been absolutely perfect. It is very easy to say, in both Norwegian and English. [And] I have no need to change the artist name [in the future]".<ref name="artist name" />

== Philanthropy ==
In June 2016, [[NRK]] said that Kygo is "giving 50 000 USD [...] of the profits [of his sold-out festival on 20 August]" to [[Frank Mugisha]]; Kygo was quoted: "Everyone should be permitted to live with one's sexual orientation. That is not the situation in Uganda and quite a few other countries across the world".<ref name=Uganda>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/hordaland/kygo-gir-penger-til-homokamp-i-afrika-1.13016965|title=Kygo gir penger til homokamp i Afrika|website=Nrk.no}}</ref>
