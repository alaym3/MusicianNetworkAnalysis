The '''Urinals''' are an American [[punk rock]] [[band (music)|band]] from [[Southern California]], United States. Known for their [[minimalist]] approach to songwriting and recording — their lyrics have been called "punk [[haiku]]" — the band influenced other punk rockers of the 1970s and 1980s including the [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]].<ref name="vice">{{Cite web|title=Stranded in Oakland With The Urinals|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rjak76/the-urinals-interview|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=January 3, 2014|access-date=May 17, 2020}}</ref> They have also been known as '''100 Flowers''' and '''Chairs of Perception'''.<ref name="vice"/>

==History==
Founded in 1978<ref name="bruno">{{Cite journal|last=Bruno|first=Franklin|title=the urinals|journal=[[CMJ|CMJ New Music Monthly]]|page=9|number=45|date=May 1997}}</ref> by John Talley-Jones, Kjehl Johansen, and Kevin Barrett,<ref name="vice"/> the band's first performance was a parody of punk rock performed for a [[talent show]] at their [[UCLA]] [[dormitory|dorm]].  Though none of the group's members could play their instruments well, they continued to perform in on-campus venues.  Their songs were usually short, seldom utilizing more than two chords.

The band’s first off-campus show was at [[Raul's (night club)|Raul’s]] in [[Austin, Texas]].  Returning to L.A., they appeared with such groups as [[The Go-Go's]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]. A roughly-recorded, four-song [[Extended play|EP]] produced by Vitus Matare (of L.A.'s [[The Last (band)|The Last]] and later [[Trotsky Icepick]]) followed.  After developing a somewhat more sophisticated sound, the band changed its name to 100 Flowers (inspired by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s famous [[Hundred Flowers Campaign|quote]]), but disbanded in 1983.

In 1996, the band reformed as the Urinals,<ref name="bruno"/> releasing a CD of new material in 2003. They later took the name Chairs of Perception (a reference to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'') before again becoming the Urinals in 2008.
