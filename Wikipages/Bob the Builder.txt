'''''Bob the Builder''''' is a British [[stop motion]] animated [[children's television series]] created by [[Keith Chapman]] for [[HIT Entertainment]] and [[Hot Animation]]. In the original series, which aired from 1999 to 2011, [[Bob the Builder (character)|Bob]] appears in a [[Stop motion|stop motion animated]] program as a [[building]] contractor, specializing in masonry, along with his colleague Wendy, various neighbors, and friends, and their gang of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] work-vehicles and equipment. The show is broadcast in many countries but originated from the United Kingdom where Bob was voiced by English actor [[Neil Morrissey]]. The show later used [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animation starting with the spin-off series ''Ready, Steady, Build!''. British proprietors of ''Bob the Builder'' and [[Thomas the Tank Engine]] sold the enterprise in 2011 to US toy-maker [[Mattel]] for $680 million.<ref>BBC Radio Four commentary by [[Gerald Scarfe]] 8 March 2013; https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b01r12ln .</ref>

In each episode, Bob and his group help with renovations, construction, and repairs and with other projects as needed. The show emphasizes [[conflict resolution]], co-operation, socialization, and various learning skills. Bob's [[catchphrase]] is "Can we fix it?", to which the other characters respond with "Yes we can!" This phrase is also the title of the show's [[Can We Fix It?|theme song]], which was a million-selling number one hit in the UK.

In October 2014, Bob the Builder was revamped by [[Mattel]] for a [[Bob the Builder (2015 TV series)|new series]] to be aired on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]'s ''[[Milkshake!]]'' in 2015. Amongst the changes were a complete overhaul of the cast, with ''[[Harry Potter]]'' actor [[Lee Ingleby]] replacing [[Neil Morrissey]] as the voice of Bob, and [[Joanne Froggatt]] and [[Blake Harrison]] also confirmed as the voices of Wendy and Scoop respectively. The setting and appearance of the characters also changed, with Bob and his team moving to the bustling metropolis of Spring City. An American localization of the new series debuted on [[PBS Kids]] in November 2015. The changes have been criticized by fans of the original version.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why some people are very angry about the new Bob the Builder |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/new-bob-the-builder-twitter-reacts-to-characters-modern-makeover-9790794.html |date=13 October 2014 |website=The Independent |language=en |access-date=2015-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Bob The Builder's Makeover Angers Fans |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/14/bob-the-builder-s-makeover-angers-fans_n_7321336.html |website=The Huffington Post UK |access-date=2015-11-19}}</ref>

The original series returned to TV in the United States on [[Qubo]] on 7 October 2020, but with the original [[British English]] dub instead of the dubbed [[American English]] one.

[[Voice acting|Voice actors]] who have contributed to the original British version include [[Neil Morrissey]], [[Rob Rackstraw]], [[Kate Harbour]], [[Rupert Degas]], [[Colin McFarlane]], [[Maria Darling]], [[Emma Tate]], [[Richard Briers]], and [[June Whitfield]].

Celebrities who have provided voices for the series (usually for one-off specials) include [[John Motson]], [[Sue Barker]], [[Kerry Fox]], [[Ulrika Jonsson]], [[Alison Steadman]], [[Stephen Tompkinson]], [[Elton John]], [[Noddy Holder]], and [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] (Bobsville's resident rock star Lennie Lazenby).

==International broadcasts==
''Bob the Builder'' is shown in more than thirty countries, and versions are available in English, French, Spanish, Serbian, Swedish, Slovenian, German, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi and Croatian, among other languages. It was shown on [[CBeebies]] on [[BBC]] television in the UK. It has also aired on [[Nick Jr. (British and Irish TV channel)|Nick Jr.]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fielding |first1=James |title=Bob the Builder becomes children's role model in China |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/175379/Bob-the-Builder-becomes-children-s-role-model-in-China |access-date=16 December 2020 |agency=[[Daily Express|Express]] |date=16 May 2010}}</ref>

The North American version of the show uses the original British footage and script, but [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] the voices in American accents and slang; for example, the word "[[Association football|soccer]]" is used instead of "football" to avoid confusion with the [[gridiron football|gridiron]] forms of the game. The original North American voice of Bob (and Farmer Pickles/Mr. Beasley/Mr. Sabatini) was [[William Dufris]], however, he was replaced with comedian [[Greg Proops]]. More recently, Bob's US voice has been provided by [[Marc Silk]], an English voice actor from [[Birmingham]].<ref name="SilkTV">{{Cite web |title=Silk TV |url=http://www.marcsilk.com/silktv/silktv.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325135716/http://www.marcsilk.com/silktv/silktv.html |archive-date=25 March 2010 |access-date=7 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="MarcSilk">{{Cite web |title=Marc Silk |url=http://www.marcsilk.com/ |access-date=7 April 2010}}</ref> In the United States, the series first aired during the [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] block (from 2001 to 2004) before moving to [[PBS Kids]] for a long run, from 2005 until November 2018. [[Qubo]] also started airing the show on 7 October 2020, but with the original British English dub.

When being exported to Japan, it was reported that characters of ''Bob the Builder'' would be doctored to have five fingers instead of the original four. This was because of a practice among the [[Yakuza]], the famed Japanese [[Sicilian Mafia|mafia]], where members would "cut off their [[little finger]]s as a sign they can be trusted and have strength of character, and will stay through."<ref>{{Cite news |date=20 April 2000 |title=Bob the Builder fixed for Japan |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/720419.stm |access-date=11 August 2006}}</ref> In fact, Bob the Builder aired in Japan without such edits,<ref>{{Cite news |date=17 August 2009 |title=2009 June 10 Japanese TV Ads Children Program Thomas & Friends and Bob The Builder |via=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVYNxan37S8 |access-date=6 January 2012}}</ref> as did other series including ''[[Postman Pat]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

==Impact==
''Bob the Builder'' was nominated in the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] "Pre-school animation" category from 1999 to 2009,{{failed verification|date=April 2016}} and won the "Children's Animation" category in 2003 for the special episode "A Christmas to Remember".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Awards Database |url=http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?pageNo=1&year=2002 |access-date=27 November 2010}}</ref> Of the show's success, Sarah Ball said:
{{quote|I think diggers and dumpers fascinate kids in the same way that they are drawn to dinosaurs. They both have a timeless appeal. The technique of stop motion is very tangible - the characters look like you can just pick them up and play with them. It’s a safe, lovely, bright, colourful world, which is very appealing. [[Curtis Jobling]] did a fantastic job designing the show - it’s very simple and stylized but has such charm.

Bob the Builder has been parodied by ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' in the episode "[[List of Robot Chicken episodes#Season 3: 2007–08|More Blood, More Chocolate]]", and by ''[[Comedy Inc. (Australian TV series)|Comedy Inc.]]'' as Bodgy Builder.

Bob has also been parodied on Cartoon Network's ''[[Mad (TV series)|MAD]]'' on several occasions. In the episode "S'UP / Mouse M.D.", Bob is seen with a smashed thumb and asks "Can we fix it?" In another episode, Bob encounters the title character of ''[[Handy Manny]]'', whom he tells to "Stop copying my show!"

A [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] cartoon shows a parent in a toy store asking for toys depicting ''Alex the Architect'', supposedly a white-collar equivalent to ''Bob the Builder''.

Some have complained about technical errors and lack of proper safety practices in the programme, especially the absence of protective eyewear.<ref>{{Cite web |title=FLUID POWER SAFETY INSTITUTE - Toy Safety - ATTENTION PARENTS! - Bob the Builder Alert!<!-- Bot generated title --> |url=http://www.fluidpowersafety.com/sfty_toy1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021105120445/http://www.fluidpowersafety.com/sfty_toy1.html |archive-date=5 November 2002}}Archived from the original on 11 October 2009.</ref> However, in later episodes, Bob is seen using [[safety glasses]].

==''Project: Build It''==
{{mainlist|List of Bob the Builder episodes#Project: Build It (2005-2008)}}
In May 2005, a sort of spin-off series was released titled ''Bob the Builder: Project: Build It''. Bob hears of a contest to build a new community in a remote area called Sunflower Valley, outside of Bobsville. He moves from Bobsville (supposedly temporarily) with Wendy and the machines and builds a new Yard there. Bob convinces his father, Robert, to come out of retirement and take over the Bobsville building business. It is unknown whether Bob returned to Bobsville in the stop-motion series or not after this spin-off series was finished.

For the US version of the ''Project: Build It'' series, different actors were found to do the voices for many of the human characters, including casting [[Greg Proops]] as the new voice of Bob, and [[Rob Rackstraw]], who played the original voices of Scoop, Muck and Travis, to be the voices of Spud the Scarecrow and Mr. Bentley for both the UK and the US. The show also added recycling and being [[environmentally friendly]] to its lessons, emphasising the phrase "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle."

This series premiered on 2 May 2005 in the United Kingdom and 3 September of the same year in the United States, and was the first series made in HD [[1080p]].

==''Ready, Steady, Build!''==
The third spin-off was titled ''Bob the Builder: Ready, Steady, Build!'' It was created by [[Keith Chapman]] and [[Mallory Lewis]]. The group, now joined by newcomer Scratch are now residing in the town of Fixham Harbour (which is very similar to Bobsville, and is even implied to be Bobsville in several episodes), deal with construction and other building tasks around the area. Unlike previous series, ''Ready, Steady, Build!'' is animated in full [[Computer animation|CGI animation]], which allows for larger and more elaborate construction projects that would be too large or expensive for the model sets of the stop-motion series, though it still retains the theme song.<ref name="RSB">{{Cite web |title=Bob the Builder: Ready, Steady, Build! |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s41sk |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref>

==Merchandise==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}
Various companies manufacture licensed Bob the Builder merchandise (e.g.: Brio, Lego Duplo, Hasbro, Learning Curve, etc.) since about 1999 to present. Sometimes some fans make fan-made merchandise for the television show, such as racing games that are not related to the show.

===Lego Duplo/Explore===
[[Lego]] began manufacturing licensed [[Lego Duplo|Duplo]] Bob the Builder sets in 2001. Lego Explorer also made the sets using the same bricks that Duplo used (e.g. Naughty Spud, Wallpaper Wendy, etc.). The sets were aimed at younger children, two and up. Duplo manufactured the sets (e.g. Scoop at Bobland Bay, Muck Can Do It, etc.) until 2009 when Lego's contract expired.

===Hasbro===
[[Hasbro]] created licensed Bob the Builder characters. They included talking characters and others to go with the Bob the Builder line. The Hasbro line was discontinued in 2005 when Learning Curve took over.

===Learning Curve===
[[RC2 Corporation|Learning Curve]] among countless others held a license to make the toys, but discontinued them. They first merchandised their Bob the Builder products in 2005 after the Hasbro range was discontinued. Learning Curve also created the [[Thomas & Friends]] characters, while the company still makes the sets (e.g. Scoop, Muck, Lofty, Dizzy, Andy's trailer etc.) and then sold them to stores. They discontinued them in 2010 and it is unknown if they could ever return to making them. The toys are currently available in the United Kingdom by Character Options.

===Character World===
In 2012, Character World announced that they had signed a license to manufacture official Bob the Builder bedding and bedroom textiles. A duvet cover is said to be available in the UK in late 2012.

===Video games===
Various companies released Bob the Builder games.
