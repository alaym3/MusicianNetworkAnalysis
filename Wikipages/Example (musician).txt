'''Elliot John Gleave''' (born 20 June 1982), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Example''', is an English musician, singer, songwriter, rapper and record producer. His name arose due to his initials being '''E.G.''', which is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase ''[[exempli gratia]]'' ("for example").<ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Wyse |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/elliot-gleave-a-good-example-2899531.html |title=Elliot Gleave: A good example – Music, Entertainment |publisher=Independent.ie |access-date=27 October 2012}}</ref>

Example first found success with the release of his second studio album, ''[[Won't Go Quietly]]'', which peaked at number four on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and peaked at number one on the [[UK Dance Chart]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/20100627/7502/ |title=3 July 2010 Top 40 Official UK Albums Archive |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=3 July 2010 |access-date=15 March 2012 }}</ref> and followed his debut album "What We Made" which was heavily hip-hop influenced due to Example only knowing a hip-hop record producer at the time. The album had two top 10 singles, "[[Won't Go Quietly (song)|Won't Go Quietly]]" and "[[Kickstarts (song)|Kickstarts]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricshall.com/lyrics/Example/Wont+Go+Quietly/ |title=Example – Won't Go Quietly Lyrics |publisher=Lyricshall.com |access-date=27 October 2012}}</ref> His third album ''[[Playing in the Shadows]]'' was released on 4 September 2011.<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/playing-in-shadows-bonus-track/id448925833 Playing In the Shadows (Bonus Track Version)]. itunes.apple.com</ref> The album topped the charts with two number one singles, "[[Changed the Way You Kiss Me]]" (produced by [[Michael Woods (DJ)|Michael Woods]]) and "[[Stay Awake (Example song)|Stay Awake]]" (produced by electronic duo [[Nero (band)|Nero]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meplusonemusic.co.uk/reviews/example-–-playing-in-the-shadows-review|title=Example – Playing in the Shadows Review|publisher=Meplusonemusic.co.uk|access-date=27 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527185727/http://www.meplusonemusic.co.uk/reviews/example-%E2%80%93-playing-in-the-shadows-review|archive-date=27 May 2013}}</ref> His fourth album, ''[[The Evolution of Man]]'' was released on 19 November 2012 and peaked at number 13 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and also peaked at number one on the [[UK Dance Chart]].

==Early life==
Elliot John Gleave was born on 20 June 1982 at West [[London]] Hospital in [[Hammersmith]] to Elaine (Johnston) and Michael Gleave. In a 2012 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', he was stated to have [[Asperger syndrome]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]]. He said "I was diagnosed with Asperger's when I was younger. I was amazing with numbers, I had a photographic memory, and I hated reading fiction, preferring books on nature and history. All symptoms of mild autism."<ref name="Example: 'I've got a metal bar. I keep it by the door' (2012-10-18)">{{Cite news|last=Lester|first=Paul|title=Example: 'I've got a metal bar. I keep it by the door'|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=18 October 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/18/example-ive-got-a-metal-bar|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref> He referenced this in the opening track to his fourth album ''The Evolution of Man'', “Come Taste the Rainbow”. He has a younger sister, named Elise. He later went on to attend ADT College (now [[Ashcroft Technology Academy]]) in [[Putney]]. Example has claimed in interviews that the main reason he started rapping was due to his introduction to [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] through albums by [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Snoop Dogg]] – the latter's album purchased primarily for "the cool cover art", and to the fact that he was not particularly good at any sports, so started rapping to fit in socially. His first experience of rapping was through a rap battle at a house party in [[Shepherd's Bush]] in 1994, when he was 12 years old. In that battle, he, in his own words, "completely destroyed a useless wanker and a fight broke out so (he) sprinted home".

Gleave went on to study BA Media Arts at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], graduating in 2003. It was during this period that he met Joseph Gardner, AKA Rusher, the producer whom he would go on to work with during his time releasing tracks independently through his All The Chats imprint, and later on Mike Skinner's label The Beats. Gleave and Gardner made a concept album in the audio booth of the University film department; this concept album contained the track which would go on to be Example's first white-label vinyl release, "A Pointless Song."

He returned to the UK and became a voiceover artist and editor for the [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Paramount Comedy Channel]] (now Comedy Central),<ref>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/article-23999465-the-fulham-rapper-leading-by-example.do The Fulham rapper leading by Example – Music – Arts – Evening Standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224134912/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/article-23999465-the-fulham-rapper-leading-by-example.do |date=24 February 2012 }}.

==Career==

===2004–2008: Record deal and ''What We Made''===

After releasing three singles through his own label "All The Chats", including the original 7" version of "I Don't Want To" in January 2006, Example received attention from [[Pete Tong]], [[Zane Lowe]] and others at [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]].
	
After signing a deal in April 2006 with The Beats, Example put out a response to [[Lily Allen|Lily Allen's]] number one hit [[Smile (Lily Allen song)|"Smile"]] entitled "Vile" and received [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] airplay from [[Zane Lowe]], [[Jo Whiley]] and [[Chris Moyles]]. His first 'proper' release on The Beats was "What We Made" in November 2006, the video for which was filmed in [[Chernobyl]], [[Ukraine]] (see [[#Film making|below]]).
	
Example's second official Beats single entitled "You Can't Rap" was released in March 2007, followed by a re-release of "I Don't Want To" on 11 June 2007. "I Don't Want To" was followed by the single "So Many Roads" (famously sampling [[The Carpenters]] "We've Only Just Begun") which eventually turned out to be the opening track on Example's full-length studio debut. After the demise of The Beats label at the end of 2007 Example self-released his next single "Me + Mandy" on 10 March 2008 through his original imprint All The Chats. The video for "Me + Mandy" was shot over four days and nights in London, in over 30 locations with over 40 extras. This was done at a cost of just £1000. It was directed by Example's friend Henry Scholfield who also made the promos for "Who Needs Sunshine?", "Vile", "You Can't Rap" and "I Don't Want To".
	
In February 2008 Example also tried his hand at stand-up comedy as part of [[BBC2]]'s [[The Culture Show]].

A song entitled "Where Did The Sun Go?" was also expected to appear on the album or one of the deluxe versions, due to live performances, but Example confirmed on his official Twitter account that the song had been scrapped due to him and its producer [[Alvin Risk]] "not liking it" or it "not being me" (referring to himself).

On 19 April, Example debuted the album's third single, "[[One More Day (Stay with Me)]]", previously entitled "Stay with Me", which was renamed due to the Sam Smith song released by the same name.
