'''The Naked and Famous''' are a New Zealand [[indie electronic]] band from [[Auckland]], formed in 2007. The band currently consists of Alisa Xayalith (vocals, keyboards) and Thom Powers (vocals, guitars).<ref name="departure"/>

The band has released four studio albums: ''[[Passive Me, Aggressive You]]'' (2010), ''[[In Rolling Waves]]'' (2013), ''[[Simple Forms]]'' (2016) and ''[[Recover (The Naked and Famous album)|Recover]]'' (2020). Since 2012, the band has been based in [[Los Angeles, California]].

==History==
Xayalith (born 1986 in Auckland) is the daughter of [[Lao people|Laotian]] refugees and was raised together with a younger brother.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/music/interviews/a40000/naked-and-the-famous/|title=The Naked and Famous Frontwoman Alisa Xayalith Isn't an Asshole, Okay?|last=Mejia|first=Paula|date=14 October 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=2016-11-12}}</ref> Her father introduced her to his [[Music of Laos|native folk music]] and, at the age of 13, she taught herself guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/doree/how-the-naked-and-famous-will-make-it-in-america|title=How The Naked And Famous Will Make It in America|last=Shafrir|first=Doree|date=26 September 2013|website=[[BuzzFeed]]|access-date=2016-11-12}}</ref> Powers had been playing in local bands from an early age after he had been taught to play guitar by his father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-news/entertainment/4213895/The-Naked-and-Famous-truth|title=The Naked and Famous truth|last=Russell|first=Nicola|date=2010-10-10|website=Stuff.co.nz|access-date=2016-11-12}}</ref>

===2007–2008: Early years===
The band formed in 2007 when Powers and Xayalith were working on what became two [[extended play]]s—''[[This Machine]]'' and ''[[No Light]]''—that they recorded with engineer Aaron Short, a fellow student at Auckland's [[Music and Audio Institute of New Zealand]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Last.fm|title=The Naked And Famous – Interview Part 1 (Last.fm Sessions)|date=2014-12-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gIIHT1jXIE|access-date=2016-11-12}}</ref><ref name="Allmusic" /> The EPs were subsequently released on local [[independent label]] Round Trip Mars. Powers and Xayalith began performing live with Ben Knapp and Jordan Clark on bass and drums respectively, while Aaron Short became a performing member of the group. Knapp and Clark left the group in 2009 and were subsequently replaced with Jesse Wood and David Beadle.

===2009–2011: ''Passive Me, Aggressive You''===
[[File:The_Naked_and_Famous_2011.jpg|thumb|right|The Naked and Famous at the [[South by Southwest]] festival in 2011]]
After recording "All of This", the group then set about recording the single "[[Young Blood (The Naked and Famous song)|Young Blood]]" and their debut album, recording mostly at home and at Auckland studio The Lab. "Young Blood" debuted on the New Zealand chart at number one on 14 June 2010—the first New Zealand artist in three years to do so.<ref name="TV3">{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Naked-and-Famous-album-set-for-August-release/tabid/418/articleID/161285/Default.aspx|title=Naked and Famous album set for August release|work=[[3 News]]|first=Tim|last=Lambourne|date=16 June 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5qh53kT6x?url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Naked-and-Famous-album-set-for-August-release/tabid/418/articleID/161285/Default.aspx|archive-date=23 June 2010|access-date=23 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Naked and Famous released their debut studio album, ''[[Passive Me, Aggressive You]]'', on 6 September 2010 on their own label,<ref name=OpenCorporates>{{cite web|title=SOMEWHAT DAMAGED LIMITED|url=http://opencorporates.com/companies/nz/3105526|work=Open Corporates|access-date=22 August 2013}}</ref> Somewhat Damaged.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coupdemainmagazine.com/music/tidbits/1985-the-naked-and-famous-punching-in-a-dream-music-video |title=The Naked and Famous – 'Punching in a Dream' music video! |work=Coup de Main |first=Shahlin |last=Graves |date=17 August 2010 |access-date=22 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302023440/http://www.coupdemainmagazine.com/music/tidbits/1985-the-naked-and-famous-punching-in-a-dream-music-video |archive-date=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album was produced by Thom Powers and Aaron Short, and mixed by Billy Bush.

On 6 December 2010, the [[BBC]] announced that The Naked and Famous had been nominated for BBC's [[Sound of... (BBC poll)|Sound of 2011]] poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/artists/nakedandfamous/ |title=Sound of 2011 – The Naked & Famous |publisher=BBC |access-date=2013-07-12}}</ref>

In 2011, the band garnered six nominations at the [[New Zealand Music Awards]] for Album of the Year, Single of the Year, Best Group, Breakthrough Artist of the Year, Best [[Alternative rock|Alternative]] Album and the People's Choice Award. They were also nominated for the NZ On Air Best Music Video and won the MAINZ Best Engineer Award and its Best Producer Award.<ref name="nz awards11">{{cite web|title=THE VNZMA 2011 FINALISTS|url=http://www.four.co.nz/TV/Home/VodafoneNZMusicAwards/Finalists.aspx|publisher=FOUR|access-date=17 September 2011|year=2011}}</ref>

===2012–2013: ''In Rolling Waves''===
The band settled in Los Angeles in mid-2012 after completing touring for ''Passive Me, Aggressive You.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/music/news/a18736/the-naked-and-famous-interview/|title=Everything You Need to Know About The Naked and Famous' Sophomore Album 'In Rolling Waves'|last=Zemler|first=Emily|date=17 September 2013|work=Elle|access-date=2016-11-11}}</ref> They had performed over 200 shows in 24 countries between 2010 and 2012. Sharing a home over the back of [[Laurel Canyon]], they began work on writing and demoing their second album. Their intention was to record an album that could be played live, not relying on backing tracks—something the group had always eschewed.

On 28 February 2013, the band announced ''[[One Temporary Escape]]'', a concert film recorded at [[The Warfield]] in San Francisco in 2012. It was released for free download on 18 March 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title='One Temporary Escape' Now Available|url=http://thenakedandfamous.com/blog/one-temporary-escape-now-available|access-date=18 May 2013|date=18 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703062841/http://thenakedandfamous.com/blog/one-temporary-escape-now-available|archive-date=3 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Entering Los Angeles' Sunset Sound studio in March 2013 with engineer Billy Bush (who had mixed the previous album), they began the process of recording ''[[In Rolling Waves]].'' The album sessions were completed in a month and then in June 2013, The Naked and Famous headed for London where [[Alan Moulder]] spent a month mixing the album at his Willesden studio, Assault and Battery. The album was mastered at Sterling Sound in New York by Joe LaPorta, who had also mastered ''Passive Me, Aggressive You'', and was produced by Thom Powers with Aaron Short. [[Justin Meldal-Johnsen]] co-produced two tracks with Powers.

On 23 July 2013, the band revealed their new single "[[Hearts Like Ours]]" along with the release date for their second studio album ''[[In Rolling Waves]]'', on 16 September 2013 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036y3ql|title=The Naked And Famous Hottest Record|publisher=BBC|date=2013-07-23|access-date=2013-07-24}}</ref>
