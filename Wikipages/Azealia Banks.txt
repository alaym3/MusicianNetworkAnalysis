'''Azealia Amanda Banks''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|z|i:|l|i|ə}} {{Respell|ə|ZEE|lee|ə}}; born May 31, 1991) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and actress. Raised in the [[Harlem]] neighborhood of New York City, she began releasing music through [[Myspace]] in 2008 before being signed to [[XL Recordings]] at age 18. In 2011, her debut single "[[212 (song)|212]]" went [[Viral video|viral]] and entered several international charts. Banks subsequently signed with [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] and [[Polydor Records]] before later separating in July 2013. Banks ultimately became an independent artist and started her own independent record label, Chaos & Glory Recordings, after multiple negative experiences with previous labels.

Banks has released three mixtapes (''[[Fantasea (mixtape)|Fantasea]]'' in 2012, ''[[Slay-Z]]'' in 2016, and ''Yung Rapunxel: Pt.II'' in 2019), one studio album (''[[Broke with Expensive Taste]]'' in 2014), and two extended plays (''[[1991 (EP)|1991]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Icy Colors Change]]'' in 2018). Her long-delayed second and third studio albums, ''Fantasea II: The Second Wave'' and ''Business & Pleasure'', await release. The lead singles from each respective album, "[[Anna Wintour (song)|Anna Wintour]]" and "[[Black Madonna (Azealia Banks song)|Black Madonna]]" were released in April 2018 and June 2020 respectively.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8293135/azealia-banks-discusses-house-inspired-single-anna-wintour-fantasea-ii-state-of-women-hip-hop|title=Azealia Banks Talks House-Inspired 'Anna Wintour' Single, 'Fantasea II' Album & State of Women in Hip-Hop|work=Billboard|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Ones: Azealia Banks' "Black Madonna" [ft.

Throughout her career, Banks' [[social media]] presence and outspoken views, especially on [[U.S. Politics|U.S. politics]] and [[Race (human categorization)|race]], have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny. She has developed a reputation for having disputes with public figures on [[Twitter]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name="The Independent">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/azealia-banks-a-brief-history-of-the-rappers-public-feuds-and-tirades-a7026016.html|title=A brief history of Azealia Banks public feuds|work=The Independent|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early life and career beginnings===
Azealia Amanda Banks was born on May 31, 1991, in New York City's [[Manhattan]] borough; she was the youngest of three.<ref name="xxlmag22ndbirthday">{{cite web|last=Diep|first=Eric|title=Today in Hip-Hop: Azealia Banks Celebrates 22nd Birthday|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/hip-hop-today/2013/05/today-in-hip-hop-azealia-banks-celebrates-22nd-birthday/|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=May 31, 2013|access-date=August 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=D.L.|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2012/12/24/azealia-banks-hints-at-retirement-promises-2-lps-in-2013-video/|title=Azealia Banks Hints at Retirement, Promises 2 LPs in 2013 [VIDEO]|publisher=Hip-Hop Wired|date=December 24, 2012|access-date=December 30, 2012}}</ref> Her single mother raised her and her two siblings in [[Harlem]], after their father died of [[pancreatic cancer]] when she was two years old.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite web|author=Ortved, John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/fashion/azealia-banks-a-young-rapper-taking-cues-from-the-street.html?_r=3&ref=fashion&|title=Azealia Banks, a Young Rapper Taking Cues From the Street|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 1, 2012|access-date=November 17, 2012}}</ref> Following her father's death, Banks says that her mother "became really abusive—physically and verbally. Like she would hit me and my sisters with baseball bats, bang our heads up against walls, and she would always tell me I was ugly. I remember once she threw out all the food in the fridge, just so we wouldn't have anything to eat." Due to escalating violence, Banks moved out of her mother's home at age 14 to live with her older sister.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sciortino|first=Karley|title=Azealia Banks: Fighting Talk|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/14493/1/azealia-banks-fighting-talk|magazine=Dazed & Confused|access-date=January 24, 2019|date=September 15, 2012}}</ref>

At a young age, Banks became interested in musical theater, dancing, acting, and singing. At age 16, she starred in a production of the comedy-noir musical ''[[City of Angels (musical)|City of Angels]]'', where she was found by an agent who sent her to auditions for [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[Nickelodeon]], and ''[[Law & Order]]'', all without success.<ref name="baronspinissuestory">{{cite web|last=Baron|first=Zach|date=August 28, 2012|title=The Making of Azealia Banks|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/08/azealia-banks-spin-issue-story/|access-date=October 28, 2017|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref> At this point Banks decided to end her pursuit of an acting career, citing the stiff competition and overall sense of nonfulfillment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azealia Banks interview – BBC Sound of 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc1zevdRivA| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211108/hc1zevdRivA| archive-date=2021-11-08 | url-status=live|publisher=YouTube.com|access-date=January 27, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Because of this lack of fulfillment, she began writing rap and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs as a creative outlet. She never finished high school, instead choosing to follow her dream of becoming a recording artist.<ref name="xxlmag22ndbirthday" />

Under the moniker Miss Bank$, she released her debut recording, "Gimme a Chance", online on November 9, 2008.<ref name="baronspinissuestory" /> The recording was accompanied by the self-produced track "Seventeen", which sampled the [[Ladytron]] song of the [[Seventeen (Ladytron song)|same name]]. Banks sent both tracks to American DJ [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Mlynar |first=Phillip |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2696294/azealia-banks-interview/ |title=Azealia Banks Says She Was Not Discovered By Diplo |publisher=[[MTV Hive]] |date=June 7, 2012 |access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> Later that year, she signed a [[artist development deal|development deal]] with record label [[XL Recordings]] and began working with producer [[Richard Russell (XL Recordings)|Richard Russell]] in London, leaving the label later that year due to conflicting ideas.<ref name="so12">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2012/artists/azealiabanks/|title=BBC Sound of 2012 – Artist Profile – Azealia Banks|publisher=BBC|date=January 4, 2012}}</ref><ref name="xl">{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07671-azealia-banks-xl|title=Azealia Banks has pop at XL Recordings|publisher=[[The Quietus]]|date=January 5, 2012}}</ref>

{{Quote box|width=30em|align=left|quote=Richard [Russell] was cool, but as soon as I didn't want to use his beats, it got real sour. He wound up calling me "amateur" and the XL interns started talking shit about me. It just got real fucking funny. I was like, "I didn't come here for a date. I came here to cut some fucking records." I got turned off on the music industry and disappeared for a bit. I went into a bit of a depression.|salign=right|source=—Banks talking of her departure from XL Recordings<ref name="xl"/>}} After leaving XL Recordings, Banks dropped the 'Miss Bank$' moniker and formally became Azealia Banks, which preceded a move to [[Montreal]]. Using YouTube as a portal, she uploaded several demo tracks, including "L8R" and a cover of "[[Slow Hands (Interpol song)|Slow Hands]]" by [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]]. After her Canadian [[visa (document)|visa]] expired, Banks returned to New York, where she sold keychains at a Manhattan [[jazz club]] and danced at a [[Queens]] strip club to make ends meet.<ref name="baronspinissuestory" /> "That's when I was really depressed", Banks has said. "I don't have a manager, I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have any friends, I don't have any money. Here I am working at the strip club, trying not to say the wrong thing and get into fights with these girls who don't give a shit."<ref name="baronspinissuestory" />

In September 2011, Banks released her debut single, "[[212 (song)|212]]", as a free digital download from her website.

Since writing "212", Banks has adopted an alter ego named "Yung Rapunxel".

But people are so taken aback that she's so herself; she's not even trying to be unique or different. She literally just lives in her head; she does what she wants to do. So, the lipstick is here for someone who is happy to be themself."<ref name="rollingstone" />
