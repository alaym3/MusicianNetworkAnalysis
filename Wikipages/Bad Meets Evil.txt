'''Bad Meets Evil''' is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo composed of [[Detroit]]-based [[Rapping|rapper]]s [[Royce da 5'9"]] (Bad) and [[Eminem]] (Evil). Bad Meets Evil was formed in 1998, thanks to the duo's mutual friend, [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]]. Their discography consists of one [[extended play]] (EP) and four [[single (music)|single]]s. In 1999, the duo released a double non-album single, "[[Nuttin' to Do]]" and "Scary Movies"; the former peaked at 36 on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart, while the latter peaked at 63 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and was featured on the soundtrack of the 2000 [[horror comedy]] [[parody film]] ''[[Scary Movie]]''.

The duo broke up after a [[Royce da 5'9"#Feud with D12|feud]] between Royce and the members of Eminem's group [[D12]]. The feud ended when Proof, a D12 member and Eminem's best friend, as well as a friend of Royce's, was killed in April 2006. After Royce's super-group [[Slaughterhouse (group)|Slaughterhouse]] signed to the Eminem-founded record label [[Shady Records]], a reunion of Bad Meets Evil followed with the extended play ''[[Hell: The Sequel]]'' (2011), which reached number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was [[RIAA certification|certified gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). The album is now eligible for platinum certification in US. The EP's lead single "[[Fast Lane (Bad Meets Evil song)|Fast Lane]]" peaked at number 32 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], while the second single "[[Lighters (Bad Meets Evil song)|Lighters]]", featuring [[Bruno Mars]], peaked at number four on the same chart. The duo returned in 2014 for the 15-year anniversary album of Shady Records, ''[[Shady XV]]'', for "Vegas", and again in 2015 to record two tracks for the boxing film ''[[Southpaw (film)|Southpaw]]'', titled "All I Think About" and "Raw". The duo have recently reunited for the song "[[Not Alike]]" on Eminem's album ''[[Kamikaze (Eminem album)|Kamikaze]]'' (2018). Eminem was also featured on Royce's song "[[Caterpillar (Royce da 5'9" song)|Caterpillar]]" on his album ''[[Book of Ryan]]'' (2018). Most recently Royce featured on Eminem's album [[Music to Be Murdered By|''Music To Be Murdered'' By]] (2020) with three songs, "You Gon' Learn", "Yah Yah" and "I Will". On the song "[[Godzilla (Eminem song)|Godzilla]]" from the same album, Eminem confirms that the duo are still active by rapping ("pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat").

===Foundation and break up===
Eminem met Royce da 5'9" in 1997 when Royce was opening for entertainer [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] at the Palladium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/50-things-you-didnt-know-about-eminem/meeting-royce|title=50 Things You Didn't Know About EminemHe met Royce Da 5'9 in 1997 when Royce was opening for Usher at the Palladium.|website=Complex|access-date=April 4, 2018}}</ref> Eminem and Royce da 5'9", became quick friends before Eminem's rise to fame, and collaborated on the track which led to the duo's foundation, "Bad Meets Evil", for Eminem's 1999 major label debut ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]''. The duo's first work, a 1999 double-single, which was originally recorded in 1998, consisting of "[[Nuttin' to Do|Nuttin' to Do]]" and "Scary Movies", achieved respectable chart success, peaking at 36 on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart, while the latter peaked at 63 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. A year later, the song "Scary Movies" was featured on the soundtrack of the [[horror comedy]] [[parody film]] ''[[Scary Movie]]''.<ref name="allmusic-scary">{{cite web|title=Scary Movie|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/scary-movie-mw0000614980|work=AllMusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=December 23, 2012}}</ref>

"[[Renegade (Jay-Z song)|Renegade]]" was originally a song featuring Eminem recorded for Royce's first studio debut album ''[[Rock City (Royce da 5'9" album)|Rock City]]'' (2002), but Royce's verses were later replaced with [[Jay-Z]]'s for his 2001 album ''[[The Blueprint]]''. Jay-Z contacted Eminem for a collaboration and beat while the song was being made. Limited in time for production, Eminem sent Jay-Z the beat for "Renegade" with approval from Royce. However, Eminem was still featured on Royce's ''Rock City'' album, on the title track.

[[Dr. Dre]] heard one of Royce's mix tapes through Eminem, deciding to sign him to [[Aftermath Entertainment]]. Eminem secured him a ghostwriting position on Dre's second studio album, ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]''. After his manager Kino stated: "I've seen Em sit Dre down like a pupil and coach him on rhymes" on a phone interview, Dr. Dre requested that Royce cut ties with his manager. Royce refused to fire his manager, thus his relationship with Dre ended.

After Royce turned down Eminem's offer to join his [[Anger Management Tour]] as a [[hype man]], [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]], member of Eminem's band [[D12]] and his best friend, also a good friend of Royce's, took the place. Later, Royce wanted to continue working with Eminem, who was busy working with D12, which led Royce to believe that D12 was "souring" his relationship with Eminem. A feud with a series of [[diss track]]s followed, resulting in the duo's break up.

===Reunion===
In 2011, Royce's rap group [[Slaughterhouse (group)|Slaughterhouse]] signed to Eminem's founded label Shady Records.<ref name="slaughter">{{cite web|title=Eminem Signs Slaughterhouse, Yelawolf To Shady Records|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1655811/eminem-signs-slaughterhouse-yelawolf-shady-records.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[Viacom Media Networks]]|date=January 12, 2011|access-date=December 24, 2012}}</ref> This led to a reunion of Bad Meets Evil with the debut [[extended play]] ''[[Hell: The Sequel]]'', released on June 14, 2011 after 11 years of inactivity in the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/116/1165858p1.html|first=Chad|last=Grischow|title=Eminem And Royce Da 5'9" {{sic|nolink=y|Reuinte}} As Bad Meets Evil|website=[[IGN|IGN Entertainment]]|date=May 3, 2011|access-date=June 17, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509064102/http://music.ign.com/articles/116/1165858p1.html|archive-date=May 9, 2011}}</ref> A chart success, it peaked at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was [[RIAA certification|certified gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA).

Recorded a few months before its release, the song was written by Eminem, Royce da 5'9" and Sly "Pyper" Jordan, who also sings the [[Refrain|chorus]] to the song with additional vocals from [[Denaun Porter]]. Eminem requested that Sly perform the chorus, after hearing [[Dr. Dre]]'s hit single "[[Kush (Dr. Dre song)|Kush]]".<ref name="struck">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665748/eminem-royce-da-5-9-bad-meets-evil-fastlane-sly-pyper.jhtml|first=Rob|last=Markman|title=Bad Meets Evil Hookman Was 'Starstruck' By Eminem And Royce|work=[[MTV|MTV News]]|date=June 14, 2011|access-date=June 19, 2011}}</ref> [[Supa Dups]] and [[Jason Gilbert|Jason "JG" Gilbert]] produced the song; Eminem and Mike Strange [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] the song.

He said that "[They] didn't even have Eminem in mind [when they made the beat]." According to this interview with ''Mixtape Daily'', Supa Dups had little knowledge about the project, but simply submitted the beat to Eminem. Months after recording the song, on April 28, 2011, when it leaked onto the Internet, Supa Dups was impressed by the finished version, lyrically, and was proud to have participated in the project. The song peaked at number 34 on the Hot 100 chart.

The second single, "[[Lighters (song)|Lighters]]", was originally intended to be featured on Royce's fifth studio album, ''[[Success Is Certain]]'',<ref name="exclaim">{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/royce_da_59_talks_bad_meets_evil_explains_how_bruno_mars-equipped_lighters_got_lit|first=Luke|last=Fox|title=Royce Da 5'9" Talks Bad Meets Evil, Explains How the Bruno Mars-Equipped "Lighters" Got Lit|work=[[Exclaim!]]|date=June 20, 2011|access-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref> but the single itself had ended up on ''Hell: The Sequel''.
