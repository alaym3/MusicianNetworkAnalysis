'''Quicksand''' is an American [[post-hardcore]] band from New York City, founded in 1990. Their debut self-titled EP was followed by two major-label albums, ''[[Slip (album)|Slip]]'' (1993) and ''[[Manic Compression]]'' (1995). Quicksand's sound has been compared to that of [[post-hardcore]] bands [[Fugazi]] and [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]].<ref name="quicksandnet">{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/quicksandnet|title=Quicksand - Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|website=Myspace|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> The band supported their releases with extensive touring but fell short of the mainstream success anticipated by their labels. These factors and internal stress led them to separate first in 1995 and again in 1999 following a failed year-and-a-half reunion.<ref name="sing365">{{cite web |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Quicksand-Biography/D0DAA8EE6584BC7F48256C670026E022 |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311072010/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Quicksand-Biography/D0DAA8EE6584BC7F48256C670026E022 |archive-date=March 11, 2012 }}</ref> In June 2012, Quicksand reunited for a special one-night performance and since has been playing additional live shows. The band's third album (and first full-length in 22 years), ''[[Interiors (Quicksand album)|Interiors]]'', was released on November 10, 2017.

==History==
=== Formation (1990) ===
The musicians who would come to form Quicksand had their roots in the [[New York Hardcore]] scene. Frontman/guitarist [[Walter Schreifels]], the main creative force behind the [[Gorilla Biscuits]] and bassist for [[Youth of Today]], assembled the band's lineup from his dissolved Moondog project.<ref name="quicksandnet"/> Guitarist Tom Capone had founded Long Island's Beyond (releasing a demo and LP via Combined Effort Records) and had previously played in [[Bold (band)|Bold]], writing their album ''Looking Back''. Drummer Alan Cage had been in the experimental hardcore band [[Burn (U.S. band)|Burn]] and played with Capone in Beyond. Bassist [[Sergio Vega (bassist)|Sergio Vega]] arrived from the short lived Collapse and a later incarnation of Absolution.

=== Major releases, touring, and breakup (1990–1995) ===
Quicksand released the 4-track EP ''Quicksand'' through hardcore independent label [[Revelation Records]] six weeks after their formation.<ref name="quicksandnet"/> The band performed at club venues and rose to touring North America and Europe with [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]], [[Fugazi]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]. Their exposure led to a deal with major label [[Polydor Records]] for the release of their first full-length album, ''[[Slip (album)|Slip]]'' on February 9, 1993, with "Dine Alone" being their first single. The album also featured two tracks that were re-recorded from the "Quicksand" EP ("Omission" and "Unfulfilled"). The following year saw the band tour the United States with [[The Offspring]], performing 250 live shows to support the album.<ref name="sing365"/> On February 28, 1995, they released their latter, more successful album ''[[Manic Compression (album)|Manic Compression]]'' on [[Island Records]] and later that year rejoined The Offspring on their European tour. ''Manic Compression'' reached No.&nbsp;135 on the Billboard 200 Chart and No.&nbsp;9 on the Heatseakers Chart<ref name="allmusic">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p20026/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard], [[Allmusic]]</ref> and garnered Quicksand an invitation to the first Vans [[Warped Tour]].<ref name="quicksandnet"/> Unfortunately, internal conflict and the stresses of constant touring led to the band's break-up in October 1995 at the height of their success.

=== Reunion and unfinished album (1997–1999) ===
Following Quicksand's initial split, Walter Schreifels started his World's Fastest Car project and produced records for the hardcore punk band [[CIV (band)|CIV]].<ref name="quicksandnet"/> Tom Capone joined former [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]] guitarist [[Peter Mengede|Pete Mengede's]] supergroup [[Handsome (band)|Handsome]], releasing a self-titled album in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandtoband.com/band/handsome|title=Handsome|website=BandToBand|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Sergio Vega began his own solo project entitled Fully while DJing in New York City, and Alan Cage joined the alternative rock band [[Seaweed (band)|Seaweed]], who had also performed on the Warped Tour.

In mid-1997, the band members were rumored to have been considering a reunion with the intent to perform on Revelation Night at Brownies during the CMJ Music Conference that September.<ref name="quicksandnet"/> However, Quicksand's first public appearance since their 1995 split would not come until February 6, 1998 in Osaka, Japan. (A subsequent show in Hawaii was canceled.) In August 1998, they entered Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut with producer Steven Haigler to begin recording material written in the prior six months. After the band's first North American performance in three years on September 26, 1998 in Boulder, Colorado, they were invited to extend their tour with [[Deftones]] and [[Snapcase]] and on November 3, 1998 started what was to be ultimately their last tour. Quicksand then returned to the studio to continue working on the new album; despite the recent successful tour and a more collaborative effort in the writing process, resurfaced tensions would eventually split up the band indefinitely in late 1999 and doom the material to remain officially unreleased.<ref name="sing365"/> The unfinished album, as well as demo material from the ''Manic Compression'' sessions, has since been circulated on the Internet.

=== Post-Quicksand activities (1999–2012) ===
Walter Schreifels went on to form the [[alternative rock]] band [[Rival Schools (band)|Rival Schools]] with former bandmate and CIV drummer [[Sammy Siegler]], releasing the album ''[[United by Fate]]'' in 2001 (before splitting in 2003).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandtoband.com/band/rival-schools|title=Rival Schools|website=BandToBand|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Schreifels later fronted [[Walking Concert]] on his independent record label Some Records. During that time, Schreifels mixed in occasional solo acoustic performances. In 2008, Rival Schools reformed for live performances at various festivals, and in 2011 they released their second album ''[[Pedals (Rival Schools album)|Pedals]]''. Tom Capone played guitar for [[Instruction (band)|Instruction]] for the majority of the band's existence beginning in December 2002. Sergio Vega has played bass for [[Deftones]], filling in for [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] on tour in 1999 and from June 2009 to the present, and was recruited to compose their album ''[[Diamond Eyes]]'', which was released on May 4, 2010. Alan Cage contributed to [[Enemy (American band)|Enemy's]] ''Hooray for Dark Matter'' in 2005 and later worked with New Idea Society and the hardcore band [[108 (band)|108]].

=== Second reunion (2012–present) ===
On June 10, 2012, Quicksand was the unannounced "special guest" on the fourth night of the Revelation Records 25th Anniversary Shows at The Glass House in Pomona, California. The original members appeared together on stage for the first time in nearly 13 years, performing a five-song set that ended with their cover of [[The Smiths]]' "[[How Soon Is Now?]]".<ref>{{cite web| last = Youssef| first = Andrew| title = Quicksand - The Glass House - 6/10/12| work = [[OC Weekly]]| publisher = [[Village Voice Media]]| date = June 11, 2012| url = http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/06/quicksand_-_the_glass_house_-.php| access-date = June 11, 2012}}</ref> Quicksand later performed at Bowery Ballroom in New York City on August 24, the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, NY on August 25,<ref>{{cite web | title = Quicksand playing NYC in August!| url = http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/07/quicksand_adds.html|website=Brooklynvegan.com|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> and the FYF Fest in Los Angeles, California on September 1.<ref>{{cite web| last = Pelly| first = Jenn| title = FYF Fest Announces 2012 Lineup| work = [[Pitchfork Media]]| date = June 18, 2012| url = http://pitchfork.com/news/46890-fyf-fest-announces-2012-lineup/| access-date = June 18, 2012}}</ref> In January 2013, Quicksand embarked on their first North American tour in 15 years.<ref>{{cite web| author = Bryne| title = Quicksand (North America)| website=Punknews.org| date = November 26, 2012| url = http://www.punknews.org/article/49802/tours-quicksand-north-america| access-date = November 26, 2012}}</ref> They also performed at the [[Pukkelpop|Pukkelpop Festival]] (The Shelter stage) in Hasselt, Belgium on August 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite web| title = Do/Vr/Za - Line-up - Pukkelpop| work = [[Pukkelpop|pukkelpop.be]]| url = http://www.pukkelpop.be/nl/line-up/all-acts| access-date = March 15, 2013| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130321170106/http://www.pukkelpop.be/nl/line-up/all-acts| archive-date = March 21, 2013}}</ref>

On July 18, 2013, Quicksand posted a photo (which had since been removed) on Twitter that involved studio activity, indicating that the band was planning to release new material.<ref>{{cite web| title = Quicksand working on new material?| work = brooklynvegan.com| date = July 18, 2013| url = http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2013/07/quicksand_worki.html| access-date = July 22, 2013}}</ref> Asked in July 2017 if it was true that they were working on new material, frontman Walter Schreifels responded, "Can't confirm or deny."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2017-07-04/gorilla-biscuits-dead-heavens-rival-schools-walter-schreifels-a-life-in-music|title=Gorilla Biscuits to Dead Heavens: Walter Schreifels' life in music|publisher=teamrock.com|date=July 4, 2017|access-date=July 28, 2017}}</ref>

On August 21, 2017, Quicksand's [[Twitter]] feed and [[Walter Schreifels]]' [[Instagram]] account teased the title of their long-awaited third album, ''[[Interiors (Quicksand album)|Interiors]]'', to be released some time this year over a 30-second video clip.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/QuicksandNYC/status/899723302372917248|title=#interiorspic.twitter.com/yipjgNjn4e|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BYEgv1Gh9rT/|title=Instagram post by Walter Schreifels • Aug 21, 2017 at 9:12pm UTC|website=Instagram|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> On the following day, the band streamed their first single in 22 years "Illuminant", and announced that ''Interiors'' would be released on November 10, 2017 on [[Epitaph Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/08/22/545267693/quicksand-returns-with-first-album-in-22-years-shares-illuminant-video|title=Quicksand Returns With First Album In 22 Years, Shares 'Illuminant' Video|publisher=npr.org|date=August 22, 2017|access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref>

On September 12, 2017, while on-tour in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], guitarist Tom Capone was arrested (and missed the evening's show at The Crescent Ballroom) for shoplifting and resisting arrest at the local CVS drug store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2017/09/14/quicksand-guitarist-tom-capone-arrested-phoenix-suspicion-shoplifting-resisting-arrest/666235001/|title=Quicksand guitarist accused of shoplifting, resisting arrest at Phoenix CVS|website=Azcentral.com|access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref> The band released a statement soon after that Tom was "heading home to get better," and the band resumed the tour as a three-piece. Capone never rejoined the band, shifting Schreifels to both rhythm and lead guitar duties. Their first release without Capone was the 12" EP ''Triptych Continuum'', which was released on April 21, 2018 through Epitaph, coinciding with [[Record Store Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2018/03/06/news/quicksand-detail-upcoming-ep-triptych-continuum/|title=Quicksand Detail Upcoming EP "Triptych Continuum"|publisher=theprp.com|date=March 6, 2018|access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref>

By April 2021, Quicksand had reportedly been working on new material for their fourth studio album. The band released their first song in three years, "Inversion", on April 13, 2021 through streaming services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/quicksand-returns-with-new-single-inversion/|title=QUICKSAND Returns With New Single 'Inversion'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=April 13, 2021|access-date=April 13, 2021}}</ref> The band released the single "Missile Command" on June 23 and announced that the new album would be titled ''[[Distant Populations]]''.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|last=Grow|first=Kory|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/quicksand-distant-populations-missile-command-1188012/|title=Quicksand Tease 'Distant Populations' With New Song 'Missile Command'|date=June 23, 2021|accessdate=July 18, 2021}}</ref> ''Distant Populations'' was released digitally on August 13, while a vinyl version will be released on September 25.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Loudwire]]|last=Childers|first=Chad|url=https://loudwire.com/quicksand-missile-command-lyrics-distant-populations-album-2021-tour-dates/|title=Quicksand Reveal 'Missile Command,' Announce New Album + Tour|date=June 23, 2021|accessdate=July 18, 2021}}</ref>

In mid-August 2021, Quicksand posted a video of the song "Colossus" with [[Stephen_Brodsky|Stephen Brodsky]] on guitar and backing vocals. Brodsky subsequently accompanied Quicksand on their late 2021 tour in support of Distant Populations returning Quicksand to a four piece -- the first time since the arrest of Tom Capone. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Sacher |first1=Andreew |title=Quicksand debut new live lineup with Cave In’s Stephen Brodsky |url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/quicksand-debut-new-live-lineup-with-cave-ins-stephen-brodsky-watch/ |website=Brooklyn Vegan |access-date=30 October 2021}}</ref>
