So you sniff it, it lasts for 30 seconds and then you have a headache – and that's what we're like!"<ref name=":2"/> Their sound has been compared to 1970s hard rock groups such as [[The Stooges|Iggy Pop and The Stooges]] and [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]].<ref name=":1"/> However, Taylor has cited a number of varying influences including [[Minor Threat]], [[Ceremony (punk band)|Ceremony]], [[AC/DC]], [[Sleaford Mods]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Cardi B]].<ref name=":2"/>
