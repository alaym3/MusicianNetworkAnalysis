'''Hamid Cheriet''' ({{lang-kab|Ḥamid Ceryat}}; 25 October 1949&nbsp;– 2 May 2020), better known by his stage name '''Idir''', was an Algerian [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] singer-songwriter and musician. Referred to as the "'''King of Amazigh music'''", he is regarded as one of the more significant modern day figures in Algerian and [[Berbers|Amazigh]] culture, history, and [[Berberism|struggle]]. Along with musicians like [[Ferhat Mehenni]] and [[Lounis Aït Menguellet]], Idir helped popularize [[Raï]] folk music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/idir-mn0000770600/biography |title=Idir Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=18 July 2021}}</ref> 

Initially training to be a geologist, his interest for music was piqued when he was called to sing on state radio as a late substitute. After finishing his compulsory [[military service]], he moved to France in 1975 and embarked on his career in music. Idir took a hiatus during the 1980s before returning in 1993. He was a passionate advocate of the Kabyle and Berber cultures.<ref name=RFI>{{cite news|title=Revered Algerian singer and Berber idol Idir dies at 70|url=http://www.rfi.fr/en/wires/20200503-revered-algerian-singer-and-berber-idol-idir-dies-70|date=3 May 2020|access-date=3 May 2020|publisher=[[Radio France Internationale]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200503104946/http://www.rfi.fr/en/wires/20200503-revered-algerian-singer-and-berber-idol-idir-dies-70|archive-date=3 May 2020}}</ref>
