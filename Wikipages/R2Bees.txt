Both born and raised in Tema, east of the country's capital city – Accra in Ghana, West Africa. Omar Sterling is the CEO and leader of the group, whilst Mugeez is the lead vocalist.

Beginning their career early, they started off representing their school in rap competitions as well as inter school music contests. This led them to participating in popular radio competition Kasahare, which they won most of and also performed at most shows; gaining them more buzz under their stage name at that time.R2bees are also recognised in the Ghanaian music industry as legends because of their outstanding achievements – Camp Yard.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2015/events/event_MS32020 | title=R2Bees | date=20 March 2015 | accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>
