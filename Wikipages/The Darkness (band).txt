'''The Darkness''' are a British rock band formed in [[Lowestoft]], England, in 2000. The band consists of [[Justin Hawkins]] (lead vocals, lead guitar), his brother [[Dan Hawkins (musician)|Dan Hawkins]] (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), [[Frankie Poullain]] (bass guitar, backing vocals) and [[Rufus Tiger Taylor]] (drums, backing vocals).

The Darkness came to prominence with the release of their debut album, ''[[Permission to Land]]'', in 2003. Backed by the singles "[[I Believe in a Thing Called Love]]", "[[Growing on Me]]", "[[Get Your Hands off My Woman]]", and "[[Love Is Only a Feeling]]", the album was certified quadruple platinum in the United Kingdom, with sales of over 1.3 million.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |title=Certified Awards |publisher=Bpi.co.uk |access-date=4 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511120001/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |archive-date=11 May 2011  }}</ref> In 2004 the band won three [[Brit Awards]]: Best British Group, Best British Rock Act, and Best British Album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2004|title=The BRITs 2004|publisher=Brits.co.uk|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref>

After extensive touring in support of their debut album, Poullain left the band in 2005, and was replaced by former guitar technician [[Richie Edwards]]. The band's second studio album, ''[[One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back]]'', was released in November 2005. The following year, Justin Hawkins departed from the band after successfully completing a course of rehabilitation from [[Substance dependence|alcohol and cocaine]] abuse.<ref name="NME 11 October 2006">{{cite web | title= Justin Hawkins quits The Darkness |url= https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-darkness-42-1350074| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 11 October 2006 | website= [[NME]] | access-date= 19 May 2019 }}</ref> As a result, the remaining members formed [[Stone Gods]], and continued to perform and record without Hawkins, who subsequently fronted his own project, [[Hot Leg]].

On 15 March 2011, The Darkness announced reunion shows, with original bassist Frankie Poullain, including [[Download Festival]] 2011, and the [[Isle of Wight Festival 2012]]. Their third album, ''[[Hot Cakes]]'', was released on 20 August 2012. Original drummer [[Ed Graham]] then left the band, feeling the strain of touring was affecting his personal life, in which he had pressing issues. In 2015 a fourth studio album was announced, entitled ''[[Last of Our Kind]]'', which was released on 2 June 2015. A fifth album, ''[[Pinewood Smile]]'', was released on 6 October 2017 and one year later on 15 June 2018 a live album, ''[[Live at Hammersmith (The Darkness album)|Live at Hammersmith]]'', was also released. Their sixth studio album, ''[[Easter Is Cancelled]]'' was released on 4 October 2019. 

After the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] put a stop to their world tour in 2020, the band wound up the year with a one-off streamed live show titled "Streaming of a White Christmas", which was also recorded as a new live album and slated to be released on CD and vinyl in June 2021. 

On 4 June 2021, the band announced their seventh studio album ''[[Motorheart]]'' would be released on 15 October 2021 with an extensive UK tour through November and December 2021.

==History==
===Early years===
Justin and Dan Hawkins played together as teenagers in a band which, according to Dan Hawkins, "did a lot of [[Marillion]] covers, [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]" and were "a bit [[progressive rock|prog-y]]". Justin Hawkins had been initially inspired to play guitar by [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], as he loved his tone and vibrato.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/26822-the-darkness-justin-and-dan-hawkins-swan-on | title= The Darkness' Justin and Dan Hawkins Swan On | work=[[Premier Guitar]] | first=Tzvi | last=Gluckin | date=15 February 2018 | access-date=26 May 2019}}</ref>

Originally known as Empire, the band generated some music industry buzz through their manager Sue Whitehouse, who was based at Savage & Best in [[Camden Town|Camden]]. Whitehouse had managed them since Justin Hawkins' time as a creator of music jingles.

Renamed as The Darkness they became renowned for their live show, and such was the popularity of the band, they had a Carling Homecoming gig booked for the [[London Astoria]] before they had even signed a record deal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Joe Taylor, Aled Jones and Paul Scaife at [[The Tip Sheet]] first heard about the band through a post on The Tip Sheet message board, and featured ''Love Is Only a Feeling'' in January 2002. They started Record of the Day, and featured the song again around the time of [[SXSW]] in March 2003. They wanted to feature Friday Night too but they were told the band was saving it for an album.<ref name=ROTD>{{cite web|title=Success Stories |publisher=Record of the Day |date=1 February 2006 |url=http://documentlibraries.org/reports/acknowledgements/pdfs/a/Record_of_the_Day%20__.php |access-date=27 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206175435/http://documentlibraries.org/reports/acknowledgements/pdfs/a/Record_of_the_Day%20__.php |archive-date=6 February 2015 }}</ref>

According to A&R [[Nick Raphael]] in an interview with [[HitQuarters]], there was no initial clamour to sign the band, "There couldn't have been less of a buzz, and only two record labels showed any interest in them."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Nick_Raphael_Interview.html|title=Interview With Nick Raphael|publisher=Hitquarters.com|access-date=22 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314061908/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Nick_Raphael_Interview.html |archive-date=14 Mar 2012  }}</ref> He believes the reason for lack of interest was that "The business as a whole thought they were uncool. In fact, people were saying that they were a joke and that they weren't real."<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> However, throughout their career critics around the world would label them as a "joke band".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Sword|first1=Harry|title=Hammer & Tongs: The Darkness' Justin Hawkins Interviewed|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/18008-the-darkness-last-of-our-kind-justin-hawkins-interview|magazine=[[The Quietus]]|access-date=23 May 2017|date=2 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Harrison|first1=Angus|title=What I Learned Growing Up as a Very Serious Fan of The Darkness|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-i-learned-from-growing-up-as-a-hardcore-fan-of-the-darkness|magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=23 May 2017|date=19 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Barry|first1=Rebecca|title=The Darkness - rock saviours or joke band? 1:12 PM Monday Dec 15, 2003|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=3537883|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|access-date=23 May 2017|date=15 December 2003}}</ref> As part of Sony Music UK, Raphael had attempted to sign them, but the band instead opted to go with [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

===''Permission to Land'' and commercial success (2003–2005)===
Their debut album, ''[[Permission to Land]]'', went straight up to number two in the UK charts upon its release on 7 July 2003, before going to number one and staying there for four weeks, eventually going on to sell 1.5 million copies in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

[[File:Justin Hawkins of The Darkness 01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Justin Hawkins at [[Ankkarock]], Finland]]
The Darkness took inspiration for some of their work from the local north Suffolk area, including "Black Shuck" which mentions the nearby village of [[Blythburgh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/The-darkness-black-shuck-lyrics |title=The Darkness - Black Shuck Lyrics - Genius Lyrics |publisher=[[Genius (website)]] |date=27 May 2016 |access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref>

The success of this album led to heavy touring for the band, including European portions of [[Metallica]]'s Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003. They then went on to headline the [[Carling Festival]] in 2004. The band won three [[BRIT Awards]] in 2004 in response to the album, ''Best Group'', ''Best Rock Group'' and ''Best Album''. They also won two [[Kerrang!]] awards in 2004 for ''Best Live Act'' and ''Best British Band''. The third single from the album, "[[I Believe in a Thing Called Love]]", was a substantial hit in the UK as was their tilt at the Christmas 2003 number 1, "[[Christmas Time (Don't Let the Bells End)]]", which only just fell short, both singles reaching number 2 in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/archive/ |title=The Official Charts Company – The Darkness – I Believe in a Thing Called Love |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=13 December 2003 |access-date=15 March 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/ |title=The Official Charts Company – Singles Chart for week up to 27 December 2003 |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=27 December 2003 |access-date=15 March 2011}}</ref>

===''One Way Ticket to Hell... And Back'' and decline (2005–2006)===

In October 2005, a month before the album was to be officially released, Justin Hawkins won an [[eBay]] auction for a copy of ''One Way Ticket to Hell ...and Back'' for £350 under the username 'turbogunhawk'. He claimed he did this so that he could track down whoever sold the digitally-marked advance copy of the album and try to prevent it from happening again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theage.com.au/news/breaking/band-buys-own-album-from-ebay/2005/11/10/1131578152968.html|title=UK band buys own album from eBay|date=10 November 2005|publisher=Theage.com.au|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref>

"One Way Ticket", the first single from their second album, was released on 14 November 2005, debuting and peaking at number 8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The album itself was released on 28 November 2005 to mixed reviews. The album was produced by rock producer [[Roy Thomas Baker]], best known for his work with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Early sales figures in the UK showed the album had not sold as well as its predecessor, ''[[Permission to Land]]''. The album debuted at number 11, and fell to number 34 in the second week of its release. Although it has since reached platinum status, this contrasts with their debut's five times platinum status.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The second single taken from their second album was "Is It Just Me?", released on 20 February 2006. The single gained a preliminary position of No.&nbsp;6 all that week, but finally charted at number 8. The album's third single, "[[Girlfriend (The Darkness single)|Girlfriend]]", was Released 22 May and charted at number 39.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The band followed up their second album with a tour of the UK and Ireland, consisting of 12 dates in the major cities. The tour opened in Dublin's [[Point Theatre|Point Depot]] on 4 February and closed in the Nottingham Arena on 20 February. Few of the venues sold out, their appeal seemingly having become more selective. Their world tour, which followed, arrived in Australia and Japan after touring Scandinavia and Continental Europe in March.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Justin Hawkins' departure and breakup (2006)===
{{see also|Justin Hawkins#Other projects|Hot Leg}}
In August 2006, lead singer Justin Hawkins was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic in concern of his health, which caused the band to cancel several concerts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/TheFeed/post/636434/Darkness_To_See_Light_After_Rehab.html |title=''Statement from the band over recent criticism'' |publisher=G4tv.com |date=28 August 2006 |access-date=15 March 2011}}</ref> Around this same time the band confirmed that they were to start working on their third album to be released early 2007. Tabloid rumours held that Justin Hawkins was leaving the band after completing his course of rehabilitation from alcohol and cocaine problems, and the band would continue without him, possibly with Richie Edwards as the front man. In response to the story being reported by the media, The Darkness confirmed on their official forum:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thedarknessrock.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112115326/http://www.thedarknessrock.com/forum/index.php?topic=2593.0|url-status=dead|title=The Darkness Rock - Even light can't escape|archive-date=12 November 2006}}</ref> <blockquote> "We're sorry that you had to find this out through the newspapers, but we were hoping until the last minute that this – Justin's exit – wasn't going to happen. We – Dan, Ed and Richie – are still in total shock and can't say at this stage what the future holds. We would like to thank all our fans, partners and family for their continuous support. You will hear from us, once we know what we want to do..."</blockquote>

Using the pseudonym [[Justin Hawkins#Other projects|British Whale]], Hawkins went on to release a cover version of the [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] song "[[This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us]]", reaching No. 6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 2007, he launched a failed attempt to represent the UK in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].<ref name="NME 18 March 2007">{{cite web | title= The Darkness star loses Eurovision bid |url= https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-darkness-47-1346780 | author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 18 March 2007| website= [[NME]] | access-date= 19 May 2019 }}</ref>

In 2011, Hawkins gave a different explanation for his departure from the band, saying he had left because he felt the band had stopped being creative.<ref name="NME 5 December 2011">{{cite web | title= Justin Hawkings: I left the Darkness because we stopped being creative|url= https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-darkness-27-1268857 | last= Goodwin| first= Tom| date= 5 December 2011| website= [[NME]] | access-date= 19 May 2019 }}</ref>

On 9 November 2007, it was announced on The [[University of East Anglia]]'s [[Students' union|student union]] website that a new band had been created comprising Dan Hawkins (lead guitar), Toby MacFarlaine (bass), Ed Graham (drums) and Ritchie Edwards (vocals/guitar). The name of the band was [[The Stone Gods]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In 2008, Justin Hawkins formed a new band, [[Hot Leg]] with Pete Rinaldi (of Anchorhead), Samuel SJ Stokes (formerly of The Thieves) and Darby Todd (from Protect the Beat). In 2009 Hot Leg released an album, [[Red Light Fever (Hot Leg album)|Red Light Fever]], which failed to make a dent on the charts (#81). Three singles were taken from it with two of them failing to chart.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===''Easter Is Cancelled'' (2019-2021)===
In 2019, The Darkness released their latest album ''[[Easter Is Cancelled]]'' on 4 October 2019 through [[Cooking Vinyl]].

Abbey Clancy|date=9 January 2020|website=The Darkness|language=en-GB|access-date=16 January 2020}}</ref>

The album was released to a generally positive response from music critics while the previous singles "Heart Explodes" and "Rock and Roll Deserves to Die" proved a radio hit on the playlists of Radio 2, Absolute, Kerrang and more. The comedic video for "Rock and Roll Deserves to Die" has also individually surpassed 1 million views.

In January 2020, the Darkness released a new video for "In Another Life" which featured model [[Abbey Clancy]].<ref name="thedarknesslive.com"/> The track then made the [[BBC Radio 2]] B-List.

The band commenced their UK tour of the ''Easter Is Cancelled'' album on 25 November 2019 in Ireland,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotpress.com/music/drink-feck-arse-guitars-darkness-man-carty-tour-ireland-22799378|title=Drink!

In 2020, the band attempted a worldwide tour across Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and North America. The tour abruptly ended in [[Adelaide|Adelaide, Australia]] on 15 March as the [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the music industry|COVID-19 pandemic]] and subsequent stay-at-home orders set in. The band returned to the UK for occasional shows and live streams where possible, with an aim to reschedule the remainder of the postponed New Zealand and North American dates in the future.

In December the band played a one-off show at The IndigO2 in London. Initial plans to open the show and sound check to a limited audience were shut down at the last minute due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The show still went ahead but only accessible by live stream. The whole show was recorded for a live album titled ''Streaming Of A White Christmas'', scheduled to be released on CD and vinyl in early 2021.

===''Motorheart'' (2021–present)===
For most of the first half of 2021 the band remained largely quiet on social media. On June 4 2021 the band announced they are set to release the new album ''Motorheart'' in October. The album was eventually released on November 19th. The album's cover was also unveiled in the announcement. The album will be available on CD, vinyl, cassette tape and digital download. The first single, ''Motorheart'' was released in August. Along with the album release, the band announced an extensive list of UK tour dates to take place throughout November and December in support of the release of the album.<ref name ="UCR">{{cite web |title=DARKNESS ANNOUNCE NEW ALBUM 'MOTORHEART'|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-darkness-motorheart/|website=Billboard.com |access-date=July 27, 2021}}</ref>
