==Etymology==
The word ''pyrokinesis'' (Greek language: pyr=fire, kinesis=movement) was popularized by horror novelist [[Stephen King]] in his 1980 novel ''[[Firestarter (novel)|Firestarter]]'' to describe the ability to create and control fire with the mind, though its use predates the novel.<ref name="Joyce"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=McCrossan|first1=John A.|title=Books and Reading in the Lives of Notable Americans: A Biographical Sourcebook|date=2000|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0313303762|page=[https://archive.org/details/booksreadinginli00mccr/page/144 144]|url=https://archive.org/details/booksreadinginli00mccr/page/144}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Walt |title=Reference Guide to Fantastic Films: Science Fiction, Fantasy, & Horror.

T. Joshi]] describing it as a "singularly unfortunate coinage" and noting that the correct analogy to telekinesis would "not be 'pyrokinesis' but 'telepyrosis' (fire from a distance)".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Joshi|first1=S. T.|title=The Modern Weird Tale|date=2001|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786409860|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YvyM5NgXopAC&q=pyrokinesis |access-date=6 September 2014}}</ref>

==History==
[[A. W. Underwood]], a 19th-century [[African-American]], achieved minor celebrity status with the purported ability to set items ablaze. Magicians and scientists have suggested concealed pieces of [[phosphorus]] may have instead been responsible. The phosphorus could be readily ignited by breath or rubbing. Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written that Underwood may have used a "chemical-combustion technique, and still other means. Whatever the exact method — and the phosphorus trick might be the most likely — the possibilities of deception far outweigh any occult powers hinted at by [[Charles Fort]] or others."<ref name="Nickell"/>

The medium [[Daniel Dunglas Home]] was known for performing fire feats and handling a heated lump of coal taken from a fire. The magician [[Henry R. Evans]] wrote that the coal handling was a juggling trick, performed by Home using a hidden piece of platinum.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Henry R.|author-link=Henry R. Evans|title=Hours With the Ghosts Or Nineteenth Century Witchcraft|url=https://archive.org/details/hourswithghostso00evanrich|date=1897|publisher=Laird & Lee|pages=[https://archive.org/details/hourswithghostso00evanrich/page/106 106]-107|quote=The "coal" is a piece of spongy platinum which bears a close resemblance to a lump of half burnt coal, and is palmed in the hand, as a prestidigitateur conceals a coin, a pack of cards, an egg, or a small lemon. The medium or magician advances to the grate and pretends to take a genuine lump of coal from the fire but brings up instead at the tops of his fingers, the piece of platinum.}}</ref> [[Hereward Carrington]] described Evans hypothesis as "certainly ingenious" but pointed out [[William Crookes]], an experienced chemist, was present at a séance whilst Home performed the feat and would have known how to distinguish the difference between coal and platinum.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carrington|first1=Hereward|author-link=Hereward Carrington|title=The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism|url=https://archive.org/details/physicalphenome00carrgoog|date=1907|publisher=Herbet B. Turner & Co|page=[https://archive.org/details/physicalphenome00carrgoog/page/n448 404]}}</ref> [[Frank Podmore]] wrote that most of the fire feats could have easily been performed by conjuring tricks and [[sleight of hand]] but [[hallucination]] and sense-deception may have explained Crookes' claim about observing flames from Home's fingers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Podmore|first1=Frank|author-link=Frank Podmore|title=The Newer Spiritualism|date=1910|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|pages=55–86|chapter=Levitation and the Fire Ordeal}}</ref>

[[Joseph McCabe]] has written that Home's alleged feats of pyrokinesis were weak and unsatisfactory, he noted that they were performed in dark conditions amongst unreliable witnesses. McCabe suggested the coal handling was probably a "piece of asbestos from Home's pocket".<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCabe|first1=Joseph|author-link=Joseph McCabe|title=Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud? the Evidence Given by Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined|date=1920|publisher=London Watts & Co.|pages=78–80}}</ref>

Sometimes claims of pyrokinesis are published in the context of fire ghosts, such as [[Canneto di Caronia fires]] and the 1982 Italian case of a young Scottish nanny, Carole Compton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/sicilian-fires-recall-nanny-s-witch-ordeal-1-513557 |title=Sicilian fires recall nanny's 'witch' ordeal |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2004-02-12 |access-date=2015-03-05}}</ref>

In March 2011, a three-year-old girl in [[Antique (province)|Antique]], a Philippines province with important mysticism and folklore, gained local media attention for the supposed supernatural power to predict or create fires. The town mayor said he witnessed a pillow ignite after the girl said "fire... pillow." Others claimed to have witnessed the girl either predicting or causing fire without any physical contact with the objects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110309-324430/Fire-seer-draws-hundreds-to-Antique-village |title=Fire 'seer' draws hundreds to Antique village |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-03-09 |access-date=2013-11-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204005323/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110309-324430/Fire-seer-draws-hundreds-to-Antique-village |archive-date=2013-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/philippines/three-year-old-alleged-firestarter-sparks-amazement-in-philippines-1.771579|title=Three-year-old alleged firestarter sparks amazement in Philippines|date=March 5, 2011|first=Gilbert P|last=Felongco|newspaper=Gulf News}}</ref> A pastor claimed to have exorcised the girl and police failed to find anything abnormal although a paranormal proponent claimed that she must have inherited those powers from a previous life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://philnews.ph/2011/03/24/fire-starter-or-pyrokinesis-3-year-old-child-from-iloilo-city-make-fire-by-imagination-%E2%80%93-video-report/|title=Fire Starter or Pyrokinesis: 3-Year old Child from Iloilo City Make Fire by Imagination|date=March 24, 2011|author=Vince|website=Philippine News}}</ref> The story of the alleged "fire starter" was featured on a June 22, 2020 news show ''[[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho]]''. Since several objects around the house were ignited, local residents flocked to the girl's house to learn of the circumstances and emergency services visited the house to investigate.<ref name=FS06909>{{cite news |title=Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho: Bata mula Antique na hinihinalang firestarter, kumusta na ngayon? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw5lYvONUzw&ab_channel=GMAPublicAffairs |access-date=October 1, 2020 |work=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]] |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=June 21, 2020}}</ref>
