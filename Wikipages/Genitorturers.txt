The '''Genitorturers''' are an American [[industrial metal]]<ref name="genmciver"/> band, with influences extending into the 1990s [[hardcore punk]] and [[electronic music]]. They proclaim themselves to be "The World's Sexiest Rock Band".

==History==
Originating in [[Orlando, Florida]], the band was founded by [[Lead vocalist|lead singer]] Jennifer "Gen" Zimmerman while attending college.<ref name="smbio">{{cite web|title=Genitorturers -Biography|url=http://www.season-of-mist.com/bands/genitorturers|publisher=Season of Mist|access-date=30 May 2014}}</ref>  Originally called The Festering Genitorturers, the band consisted of Marisa (vocals), Yvonne (guitar), Gen (bass), Larry (guitar) and Mike (drums).  Their first performance was at the Ocean Club in Cocoa Beach, Florida, in late 1986.  Also on the bill was Declared Ungovernable, Belching Penguins, and The Rhythm Pigs.  Shortening their name to The Genitorturers, the band underwent various personnel changes and progressed in the 1990s [[Florida]] "hardcore" music scene,<ref name="smbio" /> with contemporary bands such as [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids]],<ref name="bhr">{{cite web|last=Booth|first=Mitch|title=The Genitorturers – Blackheart Revolution|url=http://www.metalobsession.net/2010/03/16/the-genitorturers-blackheart-revolution/|publisher=Metal Obsession|access-date=30 May 2014|date=16 March 2010}}</ref> who also became a success in later years.  According to the band's official biography, "What emerged would be a band that would go beyond shaking up the house that 'Mickey' built and extend to paving the way and breaking ground for performance based music artists thereafter worldwide".<ref name="lv">{{cite web|title=Genitorturers|url=http://livevan.com/genitorturers|publisher=Live Van|access-date=31 May 2014}}</ref>

In 1993, [[IRS Records]] owner [[Miles Copeland III]] sent his assistant [[Nick Turner]] (former drummer for [[The Lords of the New Church]]) to see the band perform. The quality of the performance, as well as their musical style containing fused elements of hardcore punk, metal and industrial electronics, led them to a record contract.<ref name="smbio" /><ref name="lv" /> Soon after that, they recorded ''[[120 Days of Genitorture]]''.<ref name="lv" />  After recording this album, [[Morbid Angel]] bassist/vocalist [[David Vincent (musician)|David Vincent]] (Gen's husband) joined the Genitorturers on bass. He left Morbid Angel in 1995, after the album ''[[Domination (Morbid Angel album)|Domination]]'', to join his wife's band.<ref name="smbio" />

The band has extensively toured the [[United States]], [[Japan]], and [[Europe]], and is internationally renowned for its exploits and [[erotic]] show content.<ref name="lv" /><ref>{{cite web|title=About Genitorturers|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/genitorturers/biography/|publisher=MTV|access-date=30 May 2014}}</ref>

By the time of their second album ''[[Sin City (Genitorturers album)|Sin City]]'' in 1998, Genitorturers had gained a notable reputation with their flamboyant [[BDSM]]-themed shows resulting in the band appearing in various television features in the USA; including [[VH1]], [[Fox News]], ''[[Hard Copy]]'', HBO's ''[[Real Sex]]'' and Playboy TV's ''[[Sexcetera]]''.<ref name="smbio" /><ref name="lv" />

The ''[[Flesh is the Law]]'' EP includes the track "Lecher Bitch", which was also included in the November 2004 [[video game]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines]]''.<ref name="lv" /> Earlier releases included ''[[Machine Love]]'', which contains a cover of [[Divinyls]]' hit "I Touch Myself", which was produced by [[Dave Ogilvie]] and [[Rob Zombie]] producer [[Scott Humphrey]].<ref name="lv" />

In 2004, Genitorturers featured in a 12-page spread in the monthly pornographic publication ''[[Hustler]]'', the magazine's only multi-page spread with a rock band.<ref name="smbio" />  ''Hustler'' described Genitorturers as "the world's sexiest band".<ref name="lv" /><ref name="mnt1">{{cite web|last=Handelsman|first=Jason|title=The Genitorturers|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-10-25/music/the-genitorturers/|publisher=Miami New Times|access-date=30 May 2014|date=25 October 2007}}</ref>

In 2006, they toured Australia with Dead Inside the Chrysalis.<ref name="bhr" />  In the autumn of 2007, they released their live DVD ''[[Live in Sin]]'', also selling autographed copies on [[eBay]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Genitorturers Tickets for Sale|url=http://www.ticketspecialists.com/concerts/genitorturers_tickets.htm|publisher=Ticket Specialists|access-date=31 May 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531143549/http://www.ticketspecialists.com/concerts/genitorturers_tickets.htm|archive-date=31 May 2014}}</ref>

The band's last album, ''[[Blackheart Revolution]]'', was released in 2009.<ref name="bhr" />  In 2014, Genitorturers celebrated over 20 years since the release of their debut album by going on tour, '20 Years of Depravity'.
