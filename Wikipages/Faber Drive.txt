==Biography==


In 2005, the band released a limited-edition three-song EP under the band name 'Faber' but, due to legal issues with a large corporation of the same name, its name was changed to Faber Drive. Also in 2005, Faber Drive won Fox Seeds, the band competition of Vancouver radio station [[CFOX-FM]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bollwitt |first1=Rebecca |title=FOX Vancouver Seeds...2012 |url=https://miss604.com/2012/06/fox-vancouver-seeds-2012-showcases.html |website=miss604.com |publisher=Miss 604 |access-date=2021-10-07}}</ref> They were then discovered by [[Chad Kroeger]] of [[Nickelback]], who signed the band to his [[604 Records]] label. Faber Drive released their debut album ''[[Seven Second Surgery]]'' on May 1, 2007, which was followed by the release of four singles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Faber Drive – Sampler |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/11820713-Faber-Drive-Sampler |website=discogs.com |publisher=Discogs |access-date=2021-10-07}}</ref>
