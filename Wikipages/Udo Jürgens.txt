'''Udo Jürgens''' (born '''Jürgen Udo Bockelmann'''; 30 September 1934&nbsp;– 21 December 2014) was an Austrian composer and singer of popular music whose career spanned over 50 years. He won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966]] for Austria, composed close to 1,000 songs, and sold over 100 million records.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philosophische Hilfestellungen (159. Folge). Diesmal für: Udo Jürgens, Selbstdarsteller|url=http://www.zeit.de/2004/32/Lebenshilfe_2fEthikrat_32|work=Lebensart|publisher=Zeit Online|access-date=29 October 2010|author=Jan Meyer-Veden|language=de|date=29 July 2004}}</ref> In 2007, he additionally obtained Swiss citizenship.<ref>[http://www.blick.ch/people-tv/udo-juergens-ist-jetzt-schweizer-id1443124.html ''Udo Jürgens ist jetzt Schweizer''], article published on 28 February 2007 at blick.ch (in German)</ref>

He is credited with broadening German-language pop music beyond the traditional post-war "[[Schlager music|Schlager]]" (hit song) in the 1950s by infusing it with a modern pop appeal and French [[chanson]] style. His compositions and arrangements attracted fans of all ages. Until his death at age 80, he continued to fill venues in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Udo_J%C3%BCrgens-P684712/Biography |title=Udo Jürgens Biography |author=Dave Thompson |publisher=All Music Guide |access-date=26 October 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1952, '''Udo Bolan''', as he was called then, formed the Udo Bolan Quartet in [[Klagenfurt]], Austria, appearing regularly at the Café Obelisk in Klagenfurt with Englishman Johnny Richards on drums, Klaus Behmel on guitar, and Bruno Geiger on Bass. The quartet played regularly at various dance and jazz venues and also broadcast on Radio Alpenland and the British Forces Radio network produced by Mike Fior.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In 1950, he won a composer contest organized by Austria's public broadcasting channel [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] with the song "Je t'aime". He wrote the 1961 worldwide hit "[[Reach for the Stars (Shirley Bassey song)|Reach for the Stars]]", sung by [[Shirley Bassey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vistawide.com/german/german_music/udo_juergens.htm |title=German Music: Udo Jurgens |work=World Languages and Cultures - Germans |publisher=Vistawide.com |access-date=10 May 2010}}
</ref>

In 1964, Jürgens represented Austria for the first time at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964]] with the song "[[Warum nur, warum?]]", finishing sixth. The UK participant, [[Matt Monro]], was impressed with the melody and [[cover version|covered]] the song (with English lyrics by his manager [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]) as "Walk Away", which reached number four in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number 23 in the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]].

Jürgens' song "[[Sag ihr, ich lass sie grüßen]]" came fourth in 1965's [[Eurovision Song Contest 1965|contest]], and on his third try, he won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966]] in Luxembourg with "[[Merci, Chérie]]", which became an English-language hit for [[Vince Hill]], another cover by Monro, and one of Jürgens' most recognized compositions. Jürgens' version alone sold over one million copies, and he was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by Deutsche Vogue in 1966.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

In the following years, Jürgens wrote songs like "Griechischer Wein", "Aber bitte mit Sahne", "Mit 66 Jahren", and—one of his biggest successes—"Buenos Días, Argentina", which he performed together with the [[Germany national football team]] in 1978.

In 1977, he invited [[The Supremes]] to appear as guests on his televised and recorded gala concert. The Supremes ([[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], [[Scherrie Payne]], and [[Susaye Greene]]), who were on a brief farewell tour of Europe at the time, performed two of their own hits, "You Are the Heart of Me" and "You're My Driving Wheel", as well as a [[duet]] with Jürgens' "Walk Away" in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stafaband.info/download/mp3/lagu_the_supremes_live_with_udo_jurgens_1977/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222204920/http://www.stafaband.info/download/mp3/lagu_the_supremes_live_with_udo_jurgens_1977/|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 December 2014|title=THE SUPREMES LIVE WITH UDO JURGENS 1977 - Mp3 Download (3.65 MB)|access-date=22 December 2014}}</ref>
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0302-032, Berlin, Friedrichstadtpalast, Udo Jürgens.jpg|thumb|left|Jürgens in 1987]]
In 1979, he released a [[disco]] album entitled ''Udo '80'', which spawned the hit single "Ich weiß was ich will". This song was also released as a [[Twelve-inch single|12"]] disco single in an extended [[remix]] for nightclubs.

On 2 December 2007, the [[jukebox musical]] ''Ich war noch niemals in New York'' ("I've never been to New York") opened in [[Hamburg]]'s [[:de:Operettenhaus|Operettenhaus]]. It weaves songs by Jürgens into a familial storyline, similar to the treatment of [[ABBA]] songs in ''[[Mamma Mia! (musical)|Mamma Mia!]],'' the musical it succeeded at the venue.

Since 2015, Jürgens holds the worldwide-record as the artist with the longest presence in the charts ever—more than 57 years from his first entry 1958 till 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germanchartblog.blogspot.de/2015/01/2nd-of-jan-2015-first-list-of-year.html |title=German Chartblog: 2nd of Jan 2015: First List of the Year |publisher=Germanchartblog.blogspot.de |date=2009-09-25 |access-date=2015-08-19}}</ref>{{clear}}

==Cover versions==

"[[Merci, Chérie]]", whose original German lyrics were written by [[Thomas Hörbiger]], has been translated or adapted into several languages and covered by dozens of artists in both vocal and instrumental recordings. These versions include:
* "Merci Chérie" by Claude Carrère and André Salvet (French)
* "Merci" by [[Vito Pallavicini]] (Italian)
* "Merci Cherie" by Baker Cavendish (English)
* "Merci Cherie" by Fred Bekky (Dutch)
* "Merci Chérie" by Al Sandström (Swedish)
* "Merci Chérie" by Gina Trandafirescu (Romanian)
* "Merci Cheri" by Andrzej Ozga (Polish)
Jürgens himself recorded many of the translations for international release, including a version in Japanese. More recent covers include [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s 2007 recording of the French version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secondhandsongs.com/work/126086#work126086 |title=Merci Cherie |publisher=SecondHandSongs.com |access-date=25 October 2012}}</ref>
[[File:Udo Jürgens - Der Soloabend 2010 (02).jpg|thumb|Jürgens in 2010]]
In addition to recording Cavendish's "Merci, Chérie" lyric, [[Matt Monro]] covered five more Jürgens compositions, all with English lyrics (unrelated to the German ones), written by his manager [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]]. Four of these became closely associated with Monro (and were subsequently covered by Jürgens himself): 
* "Warum nur warum?" became "Walk Away" (a 1964 Top 40 hit in both the U.S. and UK)
* "Du sollst die Welt für mich sein" became "Without You" (a 1965 UK Top 40 hit)
* "Was ich dir sagen will" became "The Music Played" (1968)
* "Illusionen" became "If I Never Sing Another Song" (1977), which was later performed by [[Frankie Laine]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], and other entertainers.

A fifth Jürgens song, "In dieser Welt", became "Lovin' You Again", and in 1969, Matt Monro recorded both Spanish and English versions, the latter not released until August 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mint-audio-restoration.co.uk/News/UncoveredCD.html |title=Matt Uncovered - The Rarer Monro |author=Richard Moore |publisher=MintAudioRestoration.com |access-date=3 October 2012}}</ref> (Monro also recorded Spanish versions of "Walk Away" and "The Music Played"; all three Spanish lyrics were adapted for Monro from Don Black's versions by Leonardo Schultz, who also produced the Spanish recordings.)

In one of his last recording sessions, [[Bing Crosby]] covered an English version of Jürgens' "Griechischer Wein" called "Come Share the Wine", which also was written by Black.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/come-share-the-wine-mw0001309770 |title=Come Share The Wine |author=William Ruhlmann |publisher=AllMusic.com |access-date=4 November 2012}}</ref> The song was released after Crosby's death in 1977 as the title track of a compilation album and was later recorded by [[Al Martino]].

In 1979, [[Marty Robbins]] released an English version of "Buenos Dias Argentina" that became a latter-day standard for Robbins.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theseconddisc.com/2016/07/07/try-little-tenderness-morello-reissues-four-marty-robbins|title=Try A Little Tenderness: Morello Reissues Four From Marty Robbins|author=Joe Marchese|date=7 July 2016|publisher=TheSecondDisc.com|access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, German [[thrash metal]] band [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] released a 'metalized' cover of the boogie "[[Aber bitte mit Sahne]]".

In 2009, the German band [[Sportfreunde Stiller]] covered "Ich war noch niemals in New York" together with Jürgens on their ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' concert in Munich.

==Death==
[[File:2018-12-17-udo-juergens-centralfriedhof.jpg|thumb|upright|Jürgens' grave at the [[Vienna Central Cemetery]]]]
On 21 December 2014, Jürgens died of acute heart failure in [[Münsterlingen]], Switzerland, at the age of 80. With Austria's success at the 2014 [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|Eurovision Song Contest]], the first since Jürgens' success in 1966, Jürgens expressed his interest in performing in the interval of the next contest. With his death, the organisers of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015 contest in Vienna]] paid tribute to him with a tribute day in the "Eurovision Village" on 20 May and at the beginning of the Austrian national final broadcast live on [[ORF 1]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Finale: Tribute für Udo Jürgens|url=http://songcontest.orf.at/videos/stories/2699145/|website=Eurovision Song Contest Vienna 2015|publisher=ORF|access-date=25 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326155501/http://songcontest.orf.at/videos/stories/2699145|archive-date=26 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Eurovision Village zollt Udo Jürgens Tribut|url=http://www.vienna.at/eurovision-village-zollt-udo-juergens-tribut/4334967|access-date=25 May 2015|agency=Vienna Online|date=20 May 2015}}</ref> At the contest's final, violinst Lidia Baich performed an excerpt of his winning song live on stage during the opening act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/story/conchita-wurst-a-magical-bridge-to-open-the-eurovision-final|title=Conchita Wurst & a magical bridge to open the Eurovision Final|date=29 April 2015|website=eurovision.tv|access-date=27 April 2020}}</ref>
