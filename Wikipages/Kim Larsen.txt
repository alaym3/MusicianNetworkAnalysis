== Career ==
Kim Larsen was born in [[Copenhagen]]. Inspired by [[The Beatles]] and [[rock and roll]], he began as a songwriter and [[guitarist]]. In 1969 he met {{ill|Franz Beckerlee|da||de||nl}} and {{ill|Wili Jønsson|da||no}}, and the three founded [[Gasolin']] which, later joined by drummer {{ill|Søren Berlev|da||sv}}, became one of the most successful Danish rock bands. The band dissolved in the late 1970s.

In 1979, Larsen participated in the [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979|Danish stage of the Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "Ud i det blå" (lit.: Out into the blue). He came third out of 17 participants. The song was included on this album ''[[231045-0637]]''.

Around 1980, Larsen moved to New York. He released two albums but was not successful in breaking through in America and returned to Denmark after a few years.

Kim Larsen released a number of solo albums in the 1980s, topping the charts in 1983 with the album ''Midt om natten'' (en: ''In the Middle of the Night''). The album more or less became a soundtrack for the [[In the Middle of the Night (film)|movie by the same name]] based upon it.<ref name="Piil 2003">{{cite book |last=Piil |first=Morten |authorlink=Morten Piil |title=Danske filmskuespillere: 525 portrætter |publisher=[[Gyldendal]] |location=[[Copenhagen]], Denmark |year=2003 |isbn=978-87-02-02104-2 |oclc=66748504 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTfvg7es7VQC |language=Danish |access-date=21 June 2021 |page=266}}</ref>

In 1983, Larsen founded the band Kim Larsen & Bellami and released four albums until 1992, when after a couple of different line-ups, the band broke up. He then released another solo album, ''Hvem kan sige nej til en engel'' (Who Can Say No to an Angel). In the mid-1990s he founded the band Kim Larsen & Kjukken which was based in Odense.

By the end of 2017, Larsen was diagnosed with prostate cancer.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://altomsundhed.dk/kim-larsen-har-faaet-kraeft/ |title=Her er Kim Larsens kræftsygdom – en sygdom han deler med mange tusinde danske mænd |date=6 January 2018 |work=Alt om sundhed |access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> This would end up impacting his tour with Kim Larsen & Kjukken who were scheduled for concerts throughout January, February and March 2018. In a [https://www.facebook.com/KimLarsenOfficiel/posts/1633945236685803 Facebook post] published to the band's official profile page, Larsen apologized for the inconvenience and explained that he intended to be back playing by the start of the summer.

Larsen died of prostate cancer at his home in [[Odense]] on 30 September 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2018-09-30-kim-larsen-er-doed |title=Kim Larsen er død |author=Busk Stie, Hans-Henrik |website=Nyheder.tv2.dk |date=30 September 2018 |language=da}}</ref> A week after his death a large memorial concert was held in [[Copenhagen]] with around 35,000 people attending, and major Danish musicians such as [[Magtens Korridorer]], [[Love Shop]], [[The Minds of 99]], and [[Tim Christensen]] performing cover versions of Larsen's songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/kultur/omkring-35000-deltog-til-kim-larsen-mindekoncert |title=Omkring 35.000 deltog til Kim Larsen-mindekoncert |author=Bay Nielsen, Silas |website=dr.dk |date=7 October 2018 |language=da}}</ref>

== Protest singer ==
Larsen frequently voiced his opposition to established society and instead advocated the right to be different from the mainstream. The album and movie ''[[Midt om natten]]'' revolves around this subject – in fact you can compare the movie action to the real Danish BZ movement [[Squatting|BZ]], [[Sorte Hest]] and also [[Freetown Christiania]], located in [[Copenhagen]]. The same opposition is also shown by the album [[231045-0637]] – the title is Kim Larsen's [[Personal identification number (Denmark)|personal identification number]] which is strictly personal. Larsen was against the big database of every citizen, implied by this title.

Kim Larsen was a heavy smoker, and he was critical of [[List of smoking bans#Denmark|Danish anti-smoking laws]]. In August 2008, he paid for an advertising campaign which showed the text "Tillykke med rygeforbudet – Gesundheit macht frei !!!". The first sentence means "Congratulations on the smoking ban" in [[Danish language|Danish]], and the second sentence means "health makes (you) free" in [[German language|German]], a reference to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] phrase [[Arbeit macht frei]]. Claiming that smoking bans are made not to protect smokers, but non-smokers, Kim Larsen made a connection between smoking bans and [[Nazism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/flash/dkkendte/article1046636.ece |title=Kz-offer raser mod Kim Larsen |website=Ekstrabladet.dk}}</ref>

The biography ''Mine unge år – Kim Larsen'' (lit.: My young years – Kim Larsen) by writer & journalist Jens Andersen together with Kim Larsen, was incomplete before his death and the book was finished without Kim Larsen.<ref name="Lmua">{{cite web |last1=Rugholm |first1=Barbara |title=Jens Andersen vinder Læsernes bogpris for 'Kim Larsen – mine unge år' |url=https://litteratursiden.dk/anmeldelser/kim-larsen-mine-unge-ar-af-jens-andersen |website=litteratursiden.dk |quote=They reached the beginning of the Gasoline era.
