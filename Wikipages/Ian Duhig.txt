He wrote 'In the Key of H' with the contemporary composer [[Christopher Fox (composer)|Christopher Fox]] for the Ilkley Festival, co-operating again with Fox on an insert to 'The Play of Daniel', which can be heard on Fox's DVD 'A Glimpse of Sion's Glory'. He was commissioned by [[The Clerks]], a vocal consort specialising in pre-baroque music, to write new poems for '[[Roman de Fauvel|Le Roman de Fauvel]]', which was first performed at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] on the [[South Bank]] in 2007, and enthusiastically reviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' when performed in that city in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=Poemhunter.com |url=https://www.poemhunter.com/robert-ian-duhig/biography/ |website=www.poemhunter.com |access-date=15 December 2020}}</ref>

S. Byatt|A.S Byatt]] and [[Hanif Kureishi]]. He has also written for the stage including a piece with Rommi Smith, directed by Polly Thomas, on 'God Comes Home' at the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] in 2009. This considered the ramifications of the case of [[Death of David Oluwale|David Oluwale]], a homeless Nigerian immigrant to [[Leeds]], who died after a campaign of persecution by two local policemen.
