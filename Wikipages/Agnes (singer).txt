==Career==
===2005–2007: "''Idol''" and commercial success===
{{Main|Idol 2005}}
In the spring of 2005, a 17-year-old Agnes auditioned for the [[Idol 2005|second season]] of popular Swedish singing competition ''[[Idol (Sweden)|Idol]]'' in [[Gothenburg]], singing "Varje Gång Jag Ser Dig" by [[Lisa Nilsson]].<ref name="AgnesBio" /> The four judges were all hugely impressed by the strong power of her voice and she successfully passed through to the theatre rounds of the contest.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> Her vocals continued to impress the judges, and she made it to the semi-finals.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> To the dismay of the judges however, Agnes did not get a place in the final eleven contestants through public voting, and when she again failed to grab a place through the special 'wildcard' round, they decided to pass her through to the finals as the judges' choice contestant.<ref name="AgnesBio" />
[[File:Agnes Carlsson.jpg|thumb|Agnes in 2006]]
Despite the lack of public support earlier in the competition, Agnes went on to amaze both the judges and the public during every week of the finals, with a result of making it into the grand finale without ever falling into the bottom two or three contestants.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> With 57% of the one million public votes cast during the finale, she defeated [[Sebastian Karlsson (singer)|Sebastian Karlsson]] and was crowned as the second ''Swedish Idol'', and the first female to win the competition.<ref>{{cite web|author = Söderström, Martin|url = http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/article334470.ab|title = Nu är Agnes Idol – på riktigt|work = [[Aftonbladet]]|date = 2 December 2005|language = sv}}</ref>

Immediately after winning ''[[Idol (Sweden)|Idol]]'', Agnes signed a recording contract with [[Sony BMG]] and her debut single, "[[Right Here, Right Now (My Heart Belongs to You)|Right Here Right Now (My Heart Belongs to You)]]" was released.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> A week later, the song debuted at number one on the Swedish singles chart, a position it held for six weeks.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> The song was quickly certified double platinum for the sale of over 40,000 copies in Sweden. Just one week later, on 19 December 2005, her highly anticipated debut album ''[[Agnes (album)|Agnes]]'' was released to positive critical reviews that praised the power of Agnes's voice, who was still only eighteen years old.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> The album debuted at number one on the Swedish albums chart and was certified platinum in its first week of release, Eurovision selling almost 40,000 copies.<ref name="AgnesBio" />

In March 2006, whilst touring in support of her debut album, she released her second single, "[[Stranded (Agnes Carlsson song)|Stranded]]".<ref name="sverigetopplistan.se" /> Although it received positive critical reviews, the single did not gain commercial success and stalled in the singles chart at number twenty-seven.<ref name="sverigetopplistan.se" /> Despite this however, her first album continued to enjoy high sales success, selling over 90,000 copies in Sweden by the time it left the Top 60 Albums chart.<ref name="sverigetopplistan.se">{{cite web|url = http://www.sverigetopplistan.se|title = Sverigetopplistan|work = sverigetopplistan.se|publisher = Agnes Calrsson and Roxy Recordings|access-date = 31 March 2010|language = sv|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100330130240/http://www.sverigetopplistan.se/|archive-date = 30 March 2010 |url-status = live}}</ref>

On 22 August 2006, only eight months after her ''Idol'' win, Agnes's third single "[[Kick Back Relax]]" premiered on the TV-show "Sommarkrysset".<ref name="AgnesBio" /> The song, which would serve as the lead single from her second studio album, was released on 7 September and narrowly missed the top spot on the Swedish singles chart, peaking at number two.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> Her second album, ''[[Stronger (Agnes album)|Stronger]]'' was released on 11 October, less than a year after the release of her debut album. Like its predecessor, ''Stronger'' debuted at number one on the albums chart,<ref>{{cite web

On 15 November 2006, Agnes released "[[Champion (Agnes song)|Champion]]", the second single from ''Stronger'', which peaked at number nineteen.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> In early 2007, she embarked on her second national.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> In December, she and her fellow ''Idol'' contestant [[Måns Zelmerlöw]] joined together for a huge Christmas campaign for clothing store MQ.<ref name="sverigetopplistan.se"/> In order to promote the company, they duetted on a cover of the [[Mariah Carey]] song "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You (Mariah Carey song)|All I Want for Christmas Is You]]", which peaked at number three on the Swedish singles chart and was certified gold for the sale of 10,000 copies.<ref name="sverigetopplistan.se"/>

===2008–2010: ''Dance Love Pop'', departure from Sony BMG & international launch===
In early 2008, it was announced that Agnes had parted ways with her record label [[Sony BMG]], with Agnes citing "creative differences" behind the split.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> She then signed to independent label [[Roxy Recordings]] and on 11 August, "[[On and On (Agnes song)|On and On]]", the first single from her upcoming third studio, was released.<ref name="ac">{{cite web|url = http://www.agnescarlsson.se/|title = Agnes - Official Website|access-date = 23 January 2011|work = agnescarlsson.se|publisher = Agnes Carlsson and Roxy Recordings|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110113181652/http://agnescarlsson.se/|archive-date = 13 January 2011 |url-status = live}}</ref> The song marked a change in Agnes' music style, going towards a more dance and club style, while moving away from her original pop and R&B.<ref name="AgnesBio" />  Agnes first performed the song live on 16 August 2008 during the Swedish TV-show "Sommarkrysset".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.expressen.se/noje/1.1267616/agnes-gjorde-comback-i-sommarkrysset|title = Agnes gjorde comeback i sommarkrysset|access-date = 16 May 2009|author = Karin Skogh|date = 16 August 2008|work = Express Entertainment|publisher = [[Expressen]]|language = sv|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221035648/http://www.expressen.se/noje/1.1267616/agnes-gjorde-comback-i-sommarkrysset|archive-date = 21 February 2009|url-status = dead}}</ref> The single spent four consecutive weeks at its peak of number 8 on the Swedish singles chart and hit the top spot on the club chart, gaining a gold certification.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> The same club style would be reflected on Agnes's third studio album, ''[[Dance Love Pop]]'', which she had written together with Swedish producer and songwriter Anders Hansson. The album was released on 28 October 2008 and debuted on the Swedish albums chart at number five with first week sales of 10,000 copies.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> On 24 November, "[[Release Me (Agnes song)|Release Me]]" was released as the second single from the album, peaking at number nine on the Swedish chart and being certified gold.<ref name="AgnesBio" /> Despite the song's success, it failed to match that of the album's first single.<ref name="AgnesBio" />

[[File:Agnes Melodifestivalen 2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Agnes performing "''Love Love Love''" in the Swedish [[Melodifestivalen 2009]]]]
In October 2008 it was rumored that Agnes would compete in [[Melodifestivalen 2009]], the competition that would decide Sweden's entrant to the Eurovision song contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12567 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924121324/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12567 |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=Second wildcard revealed tonight |last=Viniker |first=Barry |date=26 November 2008 |work=ESCToday }}</ref> Agnes later confirmed this in an interview in the Swedish newspaper [[Göteborgsposten]], and it was further confirmed on 2 December 2008 by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/musik/1.1389177/de-ar-med-i-melodifestivalen-igen|title=De är med i Melodifestivalen - igen|access-date=2 December 2008|first=Carl|last=Andersson|date=2 December 2008|work=Express Entertainment|publisher=[[Expressen]]|language=sv|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203231507/http://www.expressen.se/noje/musik/1.1389177/de-ar-med-i-melodifestivalen-igen|archive-date=3 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The song "[[Love Love Love (Agnes song)|Love Love Love]]" was chosen as her official entry song. The song was written by Anders Hansson, who had previously worked with Agnes on her third studio album, co-writing almost all of the record's tracks, including the first two singles, [[On and On (Agnes song)|On and On]] and "Release Me".<ref name="AgnesBio" /> Originally, it was said that Agnes was to perform "Love Love Love" as a duet with fellow Swedish singer and former [[A-teens]] member [[Marie Serneholt]], but when it was later decided that Serneholt would be competing on her own, Agnes performed "Love Love Love" as a solo performance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/melodifestivalen2009/article3898218.ab|title=Lili och Susie till Melodifestivalen|access-date=16 May 2009|author=Susanne Nylén, Niklas Strömberg|date=2 December 2008|work=[[Aftonbladet]]|language=sv}}</ref> On 28 February 2009, Agnes advanced to the final round of [[Melodifestivalen 2009]] and eventually achieved 8th place with 40 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/content/1/c8/01/44/24/54/Slutresultat%20FOLKET%20MElo%202009%20FINAL.pdf |title=Votingresults Melodifestivalen |access-date=16 May 2009 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |year=2009 |format=PDF |language=sv |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925105642/http://svt.se/content/1/c8/01/44/24/54/Slutresultat%20FOLKET%20MElo%202009%20FINAL.pdf |archive-date=25 September 2011}}</ref> On 28 February, she officially released "[[Love Love Love (Agnes song)|Love Love Love]]" as the third single from ''Dance Love Pop'', peaking at number four on the Swedish charts.

During Agnes' attempts to promote ''Melodifestivalen'' in the spring of 2009, "Release Me" began to receive attention from abroad, with Roxy Recordings later stating that the song would receive an international release. The move marked the first time that Agnes' music would be distributed outside Sweden. The single made its first international appearance in Denmark,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cphrec.dk/da/Video_ReleaseME |title=Copenhagen Records - Agnes |access-date=31 March 2010|year=2009 |publisher=Copenhagen Records |language=da |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224032502/http://cphrec.dk/da/Video_ReleaseME/ |archive-date=24 December 2009}}</ref> where it peaked at number six selling over 25,000 copies, but most of all, "Release Me" gained massive remarks in the UK and Agnes was signed to the small independent record company 3Beat, where the song received its official UK release on 31 May 2009, proving to be a big hit, being picked up by most music channels, also with Agnes performing the song and a few others at [[G-A-Y]], the UK's biggest gay nightclub venue and also a live performance on GMTV, one of the UK's biggest breakfast shows. Release Me hit the top of Radio 1's A-list playlist, and eventually debuted at number three in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and continued to ride high in the top ten for many weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/article5253095.ab|title = Agnes etta i England|access-date = 31 March 2010|author = Martin Ekelund|date = 29 May 2009|work = [[Aftonbladet]]|language = sv}}</ref> After eight weeks it managed to get a Silver certification with over 300,000 copies sold. In Ireland the song debuted at thirty-eight and later peaked at ten. "Release Me" continued to reign European charts during the summer and autumn, being released in most European countries, becoming a success in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]].

===2019–present: Return to music===
Seven years after her last release, on 8 May 2019, Agnes revealed on her Instagram page that she would be featured on the posthumous [[Avicii]] single "[[Tough Love (Avicii song)|Tough Love]]". Before his death, Avicii had sent a message to [[Vincent Pontare]] and [[Salem Al Fakir]] of [[Vargas & Lagola]] stating that he wanted the song to be a duet by a "real couple" or a couple that have worked together enough to be almost considered a "couple". "Tough Love" was described by ''[[DJ Mag]]'' as featuring Indian influences in a melodic passage that was inspired by Avicii studying the music of northwest India,<ref name="DJ Mag">{{cite web|url=https://djmag.com/news/avicii%E2%80%99s-posthumous-single-%E2%80%98tough-love%E2%80%99-will-be-released-tomorrow|title=Avicii's posthumous single 'Tough Love' will be released tomorrow|work=[[DJ Mag]]|date=8 May 2019|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref> which he had played for Pontare and Al Fakir before his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edm.com/music-releases/avicii-tough-love-announcement|title=Avicii's Team Announces His Second Posthumous Single, 'Tough Love'|website=EDM.com|last=Cameron|first=John|date=8 May 2019|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>

It's a song that can lift you up to new dimensions and like a peaceful tank it crushes everything in its way. The song does not excuse itself and I don't excuse myself. I welcome you now to my party, and it's my party so… I can do what I want to."<ref name="Fingerscrossed"/> On 21 May 2021, Agnes released the single "[[24 Hours (Agnes song)|24 Hours]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scandipop.co.uk/song-agnes-24-hours/|title=SONG: Agnes - '24 Hours'|website=Scandipop|last=|first=|date=21 May 2021|access-date=26 May 2021}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Agnes started out in Swedish Idol, and when it came to choosing the songs for the competition she had a particular taste of genres. The first song she ever sang on Swedish television was "Varje gång jag ser dig" (''Each time I see you''), a soul ballad with a strong love lyrics. Throughout the competition, she continued to impress with her vocals in songs like [[Flashdance... What a Feeling]], [[I'm So Excited]], [[Young Hearts Run Free]], and [[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]. Already in this early stage of her career, she cited soul-singer [[Stevie Wonder]] as her inspiration.<ref name="ac.nu" /> Both her self-titled debut album and her second album consisted strongly of R&B, soul, and pop songs, continuing the path she began during her time in "Idol".

But after leaving Sony Music and signing on to Roxy, she geared towards the dance and club genre, she was introduced to the songwriter and producer Anders Hansson. Agnes recalls when his name first came up for the album "They said maybe you should just meet first and see if you like each other, as opposed to just working together". They got on – so well that Hansson ended up producing an album that helped Agnes realise her vision, Dance Love and Pop together in one album<ref name="ac.se" /> "A lot of things changed for me when I started to work with this album. I really liked it, because I knew that I wanted to do something totally different to the two others. I wanted to do uptempo, disco-orientated songs and I really wanted to work with Anders because he felt the same way".<ref name="ac.se" /> When released the first single "On and On" from her third album, it immediately showed a clear change of artistic direction for her music. This was clearly observed by the critics who all homaged her new musical style. Other remarks are ''"The album fits the dance floor at any club. A mood trigger with bubbling enjoyment"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.se/noje/artikel.aspx?articleid=4402301|title=Dance Love Pop|access-date=5 November 2008|author=Sandra Wall|date=29 October 2008|publisher=[[Norrköpings Tidningar]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802202228/http://www.nt.se/noje/artikel.aspx?articleid=4402301|archive-date=2 August 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> and "''Agnes Carlsson once and for all gets rid of the "Idol"-dust''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/noje/skivrecensioner/article1005982.ece|title=Agnes: Dance Love Pop|access-date=5 November 2008|first=Lisa|last=Appelqvist|date=29 October 2008|work=Kristianstadsbladet|language=sv|archive-date=19 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719053459/http://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/noje/skivrecensioner/article1005982.ece|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Agnes has often cited strong female soul singers like [[Beyoncé]], [[Whitney Houston]], and [[Janet Jackson]] as her inspiration in music. In an interview, she said that whenever she was home alone she would play Whitney Houston and Beyoncé's songs "at the highest volume" and sing along. "Whitney's voice is so emotional, and if there's one thing I learnt from listening to her, it's that it's important to put emotion in".<ref name="ac.se" />

==Personal life==
Agnes is married to [[Vincent Pontare]], whom she has been dating since 2009.

On 8 February 2021, Agnes announced on her social media pages that she was tested positive for [[COVID-19]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FAgnesOfficial%2Fposts%2F10158227178438370|title=Log into Facebook|website=Facebook}}</ref>{{unreliable source|date=May 2021}}
