{{Main|Unknown Mortal Orchestra (album)}}
The band's debut self-titled album was released 21 June 2011 on [[Fat Possum Records]]. The album quickly received critical acclaim. Ruban promoted a ‘Kiwi Edition’ of the album on his Instagram, which includes a bonus track. ''Pitchfork'' gave the album an 8.1, describing that with "an expert use of space rare for such a lo-fi record, UMO manages a unique immersive and psychedelic quality without relying on the usual array of bong-ripping effects."<ref>Cohen, Ian, (22 June 2011). Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Pitchfork. Retrieved 7 December 2012.</ref>

In the spring of 2012, the band won the [[Taite Music Prize]] for the album.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/music/6782014/UMO-wins-Taite-Music-Prize | title=UMO Wins Tate Music Prize | publisher=stuff.co.nz | date=20 April 2012}}</ref> Although the nominated Unknown Mortal Orchestra did not win Best Alternative Album, Nielson took home the title of Best Male Artist at the 47th annual Vodafone [[New Zealand Music Awards]].

===''II''===
{{Main|II (Unknown Mortal Orchestra album)}}

''II'' has received widespread critical acclaim. In November 2013 it won Best Alternative Album at the New Zealand Music Awards. ''II'' was nominated for the [[Taite Music Prize]] 2014, an annual music prize awarded for the best album from New Zealand. Clash Music gave the album a 9 out of 10, saying "from opener 'From The Sun', which recalls George Harrison-psychedelia, to the tender Family Stone shuffle of the closing of 'Secret Xtians', 'II' displays both a glowing warmth in its production and a deft use of space that illuminate Nielson's superbly crafted compositions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/unknown-mortal-orchestra-ii |title=Unknown Mortal Orchestra – II &#124; Reviews &#124; Clash Magazine |publisher=Clashmusic.com |date=4 February 2013 |access-date=20 May 2013}}</ref> ''Paste'' magazine called the album "a modern, beat-heavy take on '60s psych, with plenty of hooks and fuzz to get you hooked and feeling fuzzy."<ref name="stereogum1">{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/1271392/watch-unknown-mortal-orchestra-play-fallon/video/ |title=Watch Unknown Mortal Orchestra Play Fallon |publisher=Stereogum |date=26 February 2013 |access-date=20 May 2013}}</ref> NME praised Ruban's ability to turn his songs into "works of warm, fuzzy beauty".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/unknown-mortal-orchestra/14027 |title=NME Album Reviews – Unknown Mortal Orchestra – 'II' |work=NME |date=31 January 2013 |access-date=20 May 2013}}</ref>

During the winter of 2012, Unknown Mortal Orchestra capitalized on the success of ''II'' and embarked on a world tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/48744-unknown-mortal-orchestra-plot-tour/ |title=Unknown Mortal Orchestra Plot Tour|publisher=Pitchfork.com|access-date=20 May 2013}}</ref> The tour started off with shows in Australia, and hometown shows in New Zealand, followed by several stops in Europe. The band then toured extensively throughout North America with opener [[Foxygen]]. In March 2013, Unknown Mortal Orchestra was named one of Fuse TV's 30 must-see artists at [[SXSW]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fuse.tv/galleries/2013/02/sxsw-2013-must-see-bands-south-by-southwest#13 |title=30 Must-See Acts at SXSW 2013 – Photos – South by Southwest – Festivals – Fuse |publisher=Fuse.tv |date=28 February 2013 |access-date=7 March 2013}}</ref> Unknown Mortal Orchestra consistently sold out shows in both the UK/Europe and in North America, and as a result of their success on the road they announced in early April that they would extend their tour through the end of 2013. That summer the band performed at a number of major European festivals, including [[Roskilde Festival]], [[Pukkelpop]] and [[Lowlands (festival)|Lowlands]].

On 25 February 2013, Unknown Mortal Orchestra made their American television debut, performing "So Good At Being in Trouble” on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''.<ref name="stereogum1"/>

{{Main|Multi-Love}}
On 5 February 2015, the band announced their third studio album, ''Multi-Love''. Soon after, they released the title track as the first single, which was designated "Best New Track" by [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17321-unknown-mortal-orchestra-multi-love/|title=Listen to "Multi-Love" by Unknown Mortal Orchestra|via=pitchfork.com}}</ref> ''Multi-Love'' was released on 26 May 2015. It was well received by critics. ''Rolling Stone'' commented that "Multi-Love sees Nielson coloring outside the lines for a vibrant vision of connection" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/unknown-mortal-orchestra-multi-love-20150724|title=Unknown Mortal Orchestra Multi-Love Album Review|author=Suzy Exposito|date=24 July 2015|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> and Pitchfork praised Nielson's ear for how something should sound and referred to the album as his "most accomplished".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20590-unknown-mortal-orchestra-multi-love/|title=Unknown Mortal Orchestra: Multi-Love|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> Singles "Multi-Love" and "Can't Keep Checking My Phone" were both A-listed at BBC's 6 Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/e2305342-0bde-4a2c-aed0-4b88694834de|title=Unknown Mortal Orchestra|work=BBC}}</ref>

Following the release, UMO embarked on a tour through the UK, Europe, the US and Canada, with many sold out dates. On August 12, UMO performed ''Multi-Love'' on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/watch-unknown-mortal-orchestra-bring-soulful-multi-love-to-late-night-20150813|title=Watch Unknown Mortal Orchestra Bring 'Multi-Love' to 'Late Night' – Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> On August 25 they performed "Can't Keep Checking My Phone" on ''Conan''. On 16 February 2016 the band performed on Last Call with Carson Daly. "Can't Keep Checking My Phone" also appears in the association football video game ''[[FIFA 16]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.easports.com/fifa/news/2015/fifa-16-soundtrack|title=FIFA 16 Soundtrack|date=11 July 2021}}</ref>

===''Sex & Food'' and ''IC-01 Hanoi''===
The band's fourth studio album, ''[[Sex & Food]]'', was released on 6 April 2018, garnering a lot of praise from fans and critics.

In a review on Reflektor Magazine the following was said, "The consistent thread through the UMO catalog remains strong; frontman Ruban Nielson spins a soulful vocal over a backdrop of melodically rich music and slick rhythm. This album builds on many of the synthesizers and sampled drum textures introduced on the previous breakout LP ''Multi-Love'' in 2015, but offers a different ride. The entire album was covertly previewed in SB-05, the 2017 installment of a Christmas day instrumental/ambient track released digitally for free. Upon first listen, ''Sex & Food'' reveals each song in its full form, a pleasant surprise."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reflektormag.com/post/172702290454/unknown-mortal-orchestra-kick-off-the-springtime|title=Reflektor – Unknown Mortal Orchestra kick off the springtime...|website=Reflektor|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> In July, the [[BBC Radio]] & [[BBC Radio 6 Music|6Music]] named Sex & Food one of the best albums released in 2018.

Following the release, the band set out on a global tour with stops in North America, Europe, UK, Asia, New Zealand and Australia, with many sold out dates. In September 2018, they announced the release of an instrumental album that originated from the sessions for ''Sex & Food'', titled ''[[IC-01 Hanoi]]''. It was released on 26 October 2018.<ref name="IC"/>

=== ''Weekend Run & That Life'' ===
On June 25, 2021 the band released "Weekend Run", its first proper single since 2018's ''Sex & Food''. The song was released via the band's long time label Jagjaguwar. Of the new song, Ruban Nielson said "At the end of the day I don't take for granted that I have the perfect job -- I truly work to make music that will set someone's day right and I think that shines through on 'Weekend Run'". Later on August 4, they released a second single “That Life”.
