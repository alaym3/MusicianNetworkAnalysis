'''JKT48''' (read as "J. K. T. forty-eight") is an Indonesian-Japanese [[Japanese idol|idol group]] whose name is derived from its based city of [[Jakarta]] and the [[Japanese idol]] group [[AKB48]]. Formed in 2011, it is the first AKB48 sister group outside Japan and adopts the concept of "idols you can meet",{{sfn|Oricon 2011}} before switching to "idols that will come to meet you" since 8 April 2018. The group opened its own theater in the 4th floor of [[fX Sudirman]] shopping mall in early September 2012. Fans can attend daily performances (except on Monday) at the group's theater, which was built as a close replica to the AKB48 Theater in [[Akihabara]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

While JKT48 does not restrict membership by nationality, applicants must be residents of Indonesia. As of 28 November 2021, the group individually has 31 members.<ref name="MembersProfile">{{cite web|url=https://jkt48.com/member/list?lang=id|title=JKT48 {{!}} Profil Anggota|access-date=28 November 2021|publisher=JKT48 Operation Team|work=jkt48.com|language=id}}</ref>

On 16 February 2013, JKT48 released its first studio album ''[[Heavy Rotation (JKT48 album)|Heavy Rotation]]'' via Hits Records, a division of MNC subsidiary [[:id:Star Media Nusantara|PT Star Media Nusantara]]. It usually performs songs by AKB48 and other sister groups that are translated into Indonesian.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Winn|first=Patrick|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-04-04/how-japanese-girl-group-empire-conquering-asian-pop |title=How a Japanese girl-group empire is conquering Asian pop|date=4 April 2019|publisher=[[Public Radio International]]|access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref> It released its first original single entitled "{{ill|Rapsodi (JKT48 single)|id|lt=Rapsodi|Rapsodi (singel JKT48)}}" in January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Dhaifurrakhman Abas|url=https://www.medcom.id/hiburan/musik/VNnQB2vK-jkt48-rilis-lagu-orisinil-perdana-rapsodi|title=JKT48 Rilis Lagu Orisinil Perdana, Rapsodi|date=23 January 2020|work=Medcom.id|access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref>

== Conception ==
Much like [[AKB48]], the female [[Japanese idol]] group formed in 2005 in [[Akihabara]], Tokyo, JKT48 is based on the concept of idols with whom fans can "'meet', or at least develop a similar feeling of intimacy". JKT48 takes its name from the group's base city of [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.{{sfn|Galbraith|2012|p=202}} The country was seen as a potential market for the idol business because of its relatively young population—{{as of|2012}} about half are under the age of 30—and the popularity of Japanese ''[[manga]]'' series, such as ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'' and ''[[One Piece]]''. In order to bring the concept of AKB48 to Indonesia, producer [[Yasushi Akimoto]] and Dentsu Media Group Indonesia partnered with the country's largest media conglomerate, [[Media Nusantara Citra|Global Mediacom]], and [[Rakuten]].{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=1}}

In an interview on CNN's ''[[TalkAsia]]'' program, Akimoto responded to the question of why he selected Indonesia as the first target of AKB48's overseas expansion: <blockquote>"People in Indonesia were interested in AKB48. That is why we decided to try it in Jakarta. Kids watched AKB on the internet and they want to do the same, but they don't know whether they have talent. Also it's difficult [for them] to go to Japan to audition."{{sfn|TalkAsia 2012}}</blockquote> Then Rakuten–MNC chief marketing officer Reino Barack and Arya Sinulingga recounted of his visit to Japan: <blockquote>"When I watched AKB48's theater performance in Akihabara, I sensed the potential for a new business in Indonesia."{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=1}}</blockquote>

== History ==

=== 2011–2012: Formation ===
[[File:JKT48 Jak-Japan Matsuri Aitakatta.jpg|thumb|JKT48 performs in September 2012]]
On 11 September 2011, the formation of JKT48 was announced at an AKB48 event held at [[Makuhari Messe]] in Chiba, Japan.{{sfn|Anime News Network 2011}} Applicant interviews took place the following weeks, in late September 2011, and the first auditions were held a month after the initial announcement, from 8–9 October 2011.{{sfn|Oricon 2011}} AKB48 member [[Minami Takahashi]] also visited Jakarta during the auditions to promote JKT48 among fans of AKB48.{{sfn|Asahi Shimbun 2011}} Although applicants did not have to be Indonesian citizens, they did have to already reside in the country.{{sfn|Mainichi Shimbun 2011}} Approximately 1,200 girls auditioned for the group, and 51 were selected to proceed to the second round. Finalists were judged based on their dance performance of "[[Heavy Rotation (song)|Heavy Rotation]]", from AKB48's single of the same name, and their performance of a song of their choice.{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012|p=2}} JKT48's 28 first generation members, ages 12–21, were selected on 2 November 2011.{{sfn|The Japan Times 2011}}

On 17 December 2011, JKT48 made its first public appearance on the live music program ''100% Ampuh'' on [[Global TV (Indonesia)|Global TV]], performing "Heavy Rotation", with lyrics translated into Indonesian.{{sfn|Natalie 2011, JKT48: First Performance of Japan's "Heavy Rotation" & First Handshake Event}}

As part of the concept of "idols you can meet every day", AKB48 performs daily at its theater in Akihabara.{{sfn|JKT48 Operation Team, Apa Itu AKB48}} The JKT48 management team aimed to accomplish this same principle and began scouting locations in Jakarta for the group's own theater in early 2012. An unoccupied site in the [[fX Sudirman]] shopping mall was selected as the theater's eventual location, and planning for its renovation began in April.{{sfn|Mr. Sunday 2012}} In the meantime, the first theater performances were held 17–20 May 2012 at a temporary stage in the Nyi Ageng Serang Building in Kuningan, Jakarta.{{sfn|Ogino|Ohira|2012|p=12}} The official theater opened on 8 September 2012 for daily performances with a [[set list]] of 16 songs that have been translated into Indonesian. The theater first had a seating capacity of 180 and standing room for 30, and its design is a close replica of the AKB48 Theater.{{sfn|Maruli 2012}} Currently it holds around 350 people, both seated and standing.

JKT48 has also performed in Japan alongside other AKB48 sister groups. In its first performance in Japan, the group was a surprise guest at 2011 AKB48 ''Kōhaku Taikō Uta Gassen'' and performed the Indonesian version of "[[Aitakatta]]".{{sfn|Natalie 2011, Yūko Ōshima Leads White Team to Victory in First AKB48 Kōhaku Taikō Uta Gassen}} It also performed alongside AKB48 and other sister groups at the [[62nd NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen|62nd NHK ''Kōhaku Uta Gassen'']] with a total 210 members onstage.{{sfn|Nihon Keizai Shimbun 2012}}{{sfn|Yomiuri Shimbun 2011}} It also participated in the 2012 AKB48 concerts at [[Saitama Super Arena]] and [[Tokyo Dome]].{{sfn|Natalie 2012, Atsuko Maeda's Graduation and General Election Announced at AKB48's Final Day at Saitama Super Arena}}{{sfn|Natalie 2012, Atsuko Maeda Cries "My Entire Youth" at AKB48's Final Day at Tokyo Dome}}

On 13 August 2012, management began accepting applications for second generation members. Of the 4,500 applicants, approximately 200 were selected for interviews the following month. The pool was then narrowed down from 67 to 31 in a selection round held by [[RCTI]].{{sfn|Tribun 2012}} All 31 finalists were eventually chosen as second generation members at a final audition on 3 November in Japan.{{sfn|Halo Jepang! 2012, Seluruh Finalis JKT48 Generasi 2 Lulus Seleksi}} Additionally, AKB48 members [[Aki Takajō]] and [[Haruka Nakagawa]], whose transfers to JKT48 were announced at the Tokyo Dome concert, officially began their activities with the group on 1 November and made their theater debut on 26 December.{{sfn|Oricon 2012}} Nakagawa became interested in Jakarta during a visit with other members of AKB48 earlier in February 2012.{{sfn|Mainichi Shimbun 2012}}

JKT48 is billed as a "unique idol group with Indonesian culture". Harris Thayeb, President Director of the group's promotional agent [[Dentsu]] Media Group Indonesia, believed the group's concept "will make our idols more down to earth, being always nice and able to be greeted anytime".{{sfn|The Japan Times 2011}} The group was seen as part of the "[[Cool Japan]]" brand adopted by the Japanese government to promote the country's culture around the world.{{sfn|International Business Times 2012}}

On 25 February 2012, JKT48 held a joint concert with AKB48 at the Japan Pop Culture Festival at Balai Kartini in Jakarta. The event was sponsored by the Embassy of Japan, the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs|Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs]], and the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy. According to Junji Shimada, deputy to the Japanese ambassador, AKB48 was invited to perform because of its status as a Japanese pop icon, and the two sister groups represent the friendship between Japan and Indonesia.{{sfn|Burhani 2012}}

JKT48 appeared in television shows almost daily after its debut and in television advertisements by Japanese companies that intend to capture a share of the rapidly growing Indonesian market.
