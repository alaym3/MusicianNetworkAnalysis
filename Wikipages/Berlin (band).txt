'''Berlin''' is an American [[New wave music|new wave]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1978. The band gained commercial success in the 1980s with singles including "[[The Metro (song)|The Metro]]", "[[Sex (I'm A...)]]", "[[No More Words]]" and the chart-topping "[[Take My Breath Away]]" from the 1986 film ''[[Top Gun]]''. The best-known lineup consisted of singer [[Terri Nunn]], bass guitarist and vocalist [[John Crawford (musician)|John Crawford]], keyboardist David Diamond, guitarist Ric Olsen, keyboardist Matt Reid, and drummer Rod Learned.

==History==

===Early years===
The genesis of Berlin was the new wave rock band the Toys, formed in 1976 in [[Orange County, California]], by [[John Crawford (musician)|John Crawford]] (bass guitar), Dan Van Patten (drums), Chris Ruiz-Velasco (guitar), and Ty Cobb (vocals).<ref name="Berlin - Official Band">{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/berlinofficialband/posts/1177325525720344|title=Berlin - Official Band|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/johncrawfordberlin/about/?ref=page_internal|title=John Crawford - Berlin|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref> After a few shows, the band changed its name to Berlin, discharging Cobb as lead singer in the process. After a brief time where [[Toni Childs]] was lead singer, [[Terri Nunn]] joined the band after answering an ad through the Musicians Contact Service in Hollywood in 1979.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2018/01/10/eighties-acts-the-romantics-and-berlin-team-up-for-hard-rock-live-gig|title=Eighties Acts the Romantics and Berlin Team Up for Hard Rock Live Gig|last=Niesel|first=Jeff|work=Cleveland Scene|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}</ref> Despite its name, Berlin did not have any known major connections with [[Berlin|the former (later renewed) capital of Germany]]; the name was chosen to make them seem European and exotic.  As lead singer, Nunn would eventually take the Berlin name as her alternate moniker.  The band was inspired by the keyboard-oriented groups [[Kraftwerk]], [[Devo]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] and [[The Screamers]].

The band's first single, "A Matter of Time", was released in 1979 on Renegade Records<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Berlin-A-Matter-Of-Time/master/139617|title=Berlin - A Matter Of Time|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref> and they appeared on television for the first time on the short-lived "[[Hollywood Heartbeat]]" hosted by former Fleetwood Mac guitarist, [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]].<ref>{{Citation|last=morrisonAV|title=Berlin - A Matter of Time (1979)|date=2009-06-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=APPhaCUZj-0|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref> Nunn left the group later that year to pursue an acting career forcing the band to replace her with Virginia Maccolino. The band released the 1980 album ''Information'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Berlin-Information/release/1009103|title=Berlin - Information|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lostturntable.com/2016/03/21/10-years-of-being-lost-berlins-information/|title=10 Years Of Being Lost: Berlin's Information|work=Lost Turntable|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}</ref> with Maccolino as lead vocalist, but the band struggled signing with a mainstream label without Nunn. As band manager, Perry Watts-Russell explained, "Unfortunately, the record labels that had shown interest in December 1979, when Terri was the singer, were no longer keen to sign the band. So, by later that year, Berlin had effectively broken up, and John had formed and was the lead singer in another group, Fahrenheit, with Dan Van Patten. But he had some songs that he thought were better suited to Terri's voice and he asked me if I thought she might be interested in singing them. We asked and she was."<ref name="Berlin - Official Band"/>

===Eventual success===
Terri Nunn rejoined the band as singer in 1980, and they signed to independent label [[Enigma Records]] on which they released a [[double A-sided]] single, "Tell Me Why" / "[[The Metro (song)|The Metro]]". The single was intended as a one-off, since Crawford was by then focusing on his new band Fahrenheit and regarded Berlin as a "just for fun" side project.<ref name="Record8">{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Marianne |title=We Now Take 'Sex' Seriously, Thanks to a Shot in the Dark|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2 |issue=8|page=6}}</ref> However, the single was a success, helping to finance the [[Extended play|EP]] album, ''[[Pleasure Victim]]'', which was recorded on a $2,900 budget.<ref name="Record8"/> The EP included their first significant hit: the controversial synth-driven "[[Sex (I'm A...)]]" (1982), which was banned by some radio stations due to its graphic lyrics. The song was intentionally written and composed to get airplay on Los Angeles radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]], which specialized in playing music that was not heard on other stations, and of which members of the group were fans.<ref name="Ink19">{{cite web|url=http://www.ink19.com/issues/june2006/interviews/beyondMetroAn.html|title=Beyond The Metro: Terri Nunn|last=Worley|first=Gail|publisher=Ink 19|access-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref> Due to the attention brought on by the single, wider release offers were made by larger record labels for ''Pleasure Victim''.<ref name="Record8"/> Geffen Records' offer was accepted and the label re-released ''Pleasure Victim'' worldwide in early 1983. The label also re-released "The Metro", which then became another hit. The band appeared at the 1983 [[US Festival]].

In 1984, the band released their next album, ''[[Love Life (Berlin album)|Love Life]]'', and the single "[[No More Words (Berlin song)|No More Words]]", whose subsequent video saw Terri Nunn and bandmates re-enact a [[Bonnie and Clyde]]-style car chase and shoot-out, became their first top-40 hit. "[[Take My Breath Away]]" (for the movie ''[[Top Gun]] soundtrack''), co-written and produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]], became their best-selling single in 1986 and a huge international hit, but also their last big hit.

Aside from Nunn, members of the band were founding member [[John Crawford (musician)|John Crawford]] (primary songwriter, bass guitar and synthesizer), and David Diamond (synthesizer & guitar). Ric Olsen (lead guitar) was brought in during the final recording of ''Pleasure Victim''. Other members added were Matt Reid (synthesizer), Rob Brill (drums: 1983&ndash;1987) and Rod Learned (drums: 1979&ndash;1983). Berlin's breakout EP, 1982's ''Pleasure Victim'', featured Nunn, Crawford, and Diamond, as well as guitarist Olsen, drummer, synthesist and producer Dan Van Patten and guitarist Chris Ruiz-Velasco. (These last two were founding members, along with Crawford and original male vocalist Tyson Cobb.) Before ''Pleasure Victim'' was completed, Van Patten and Ruiz-Velasco parted ways with Nunn, Crawford, and Diamond. Ric Olsen was brought in to complete tracks on ''Pleasure Victim''.

===Dissolution and re-formation===
{{More citations needed section|reason=timing of bandmates joining and leaving & reasons for changes have few citations|date=November 2014}}
Berlin officially disbanded in 1987, partly due to the lack of success of their album ''[[Count Three & Pray]]'' and because of personal disagreements over the single "Take My Breath Away". Nunn viewed it as a fresh new song that allowed the band to perform globally, while others disliked it as it had not been written or composed by any of them.<ref name="Fox">{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/05/09/berlins-terri-nunn-was-almost-princess-leia-but-still-takes-our-breath-away/ |title=Berlin's Terri Nunn was almost Princess Leia |date=May 9, 2014|access-date=April 23, 2015}}</ref> Later, after the release of the 1991 solo album ''[[Moment of Truth (Terri Nunn album)|Moment of Truth]]'', Nunn retained the legal rights to usage of the band's name after legal wranglings with the founding member of the group, John Crawford. Nunn recreated Berlin, with a new lineup of musicians, in 1997. In 1999, Berlin opened for [[The Go-Go's]] on their West Coast reunion tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/515112/19990608/go.gos.jhtml |title=Go-Go's Set Dates for Reunion Tour |publisher=Vh1.com |access-date=December 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151848/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/515112/19990608/go.gos.jhtml |archive-date=June 6, 2011 }}</ref>

===After 2000===
{{More citations needed section|reason=contributions to tribute material has NO citations|date=November 2014}}
In 2000&ndash;2001, Berlin contributed to several artist [[tribute album]]s. The only track to make it on to a full Berlin release is a cover of [[Marilyn Manson]]'s "The Dope Show", which is included on Berlin's ''4play'' album as well as the Marilyn Manson tribute album ''Anonymous Messiah'' (2001, Vitamin Records). Other tributes include material by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Depeche Mode]].

Berlin was featured on the [[VH1]] show, ''[[Bands Reunited]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0518395/|title="Bands Reunited" Berlin (TV Episode 2004) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=August 15, 2021}}</ref> where the roughly pre-''Love Life'' era lineup of the band (John Crawford, Terri Nunn, David Diamond, Ric Olsen, Matt Reid and Rod Learned) agreed to reunite as a band and as friends. They played one show at The Roxy in California to a sold-out crowd.

The band, featuring Nunn supported by other members who were not part of the classic line-up, toured with rock band [[INXS]] during the summer of 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popinstereo.com/?p=17378/ |title=INXS Announce North American Tour, Select Dates With Berlin |publisher=Popinstereo.com |access-date=May 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730155030/http://www.popinstereo.com/?p=17378%2F |archive-date=July 30, 2012 }}</ref> [[Gerald Casale]] of [[Devo]] created a video for Berlin which was scheduled to debut at a late November 2011 performance.<ref name=Patch/> Nunn herself was scheduled both to debut a radio show on [[KCSN|KCSN-FM]], and to record a new album, in 2012.<ref name=Patch>{{cite web |url=http://agourahills.patch.com/articles/berlin-s-terri-nunn-an-agoura-girl-at-heart |title=Berlin's Terri Nunn: An Agoura Girl at Heart |first=Susan |last=Pascal |work=Agourah Hills [[Patch.com|Patch]] |publisher=Patch Media |date=March 22, 2012 |access-date=August 9, 2013}}</ref>

In July 2013, it was announced that a new album called ''Animal'' would be released on September 17, from which a single "It's The Way" would also be issued.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://berlinpage.com/news/new-album-animal-set-for-release-september-17th|publisher=Berlinpage.com|title=New Album 'Animal' Set For Release on September 17|access-date=August 9, 2013}}</ref>

In an August 9, 2016, interview with ''The Washington Times'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/9/berlin-reuniting-terri-nunn-and-rest-original-line/|title=Berlin reuniting with Terri Nunn and rest of original lineup for possible tour |last=Valcourt |first=Keith |date=August 9, 2016 |website=washingtontimes.com |access-date=November 8, 2017}}</ref> Nunn announced the original members (Crawford, Nunn and Diamond) had been writing new material, and planning a tour and new album for 2017.

On the 80s Cruise 2018, Ric Olsen, David Diamond and John Crawford performed with the Nunn-fronted version of Berlin. Rather than replacing any of the existing members, Diamond and Crawford are merging with Nunn's current Berlin incarnation to form a six-person line-up. They performed two new songs from their forthcoming album.  They jokingly announced the album's title would be ''Woke'', a suggestion from VJ Mark Goodman during a Q & A session on the cruise, and that the album would be released in July 2018. Although an official name has not been determined, the new album was scheduled for release later that year.

In May 2019, Terri Nunn announced that she and co-founders John Crawford and David Diamond would be reuniting for a new album, ''Transcendance'', to be released on August 2, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last=Graff |first=Gary |title=Berlin's Terri Nunn Talks Reuniting With Co-Founders for New Album & Sex In Your Fifties |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8510681/berlin-terri-nunn-reunion-new-album |date=May 9, 2019|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

Berlin was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref> The accuracy of this report was disputed by Vinny Vero, a music producer who works for the reissue label Cherry Red. Vero observed that Berlin's album masters were “safe and sound” while working on reissues of another Geffen recording artist. Later the same year, Universal located two session reels containing 11 unique or early versions of songs recorded in 1983 between ''Pleasure Victim'' and ''Love Life'', as well as an unreleased outtake from ''Love Life''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Davies |first=Scott |title=For those who were guessing Berlin, you were right |url= https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/new-classic-alt-reissue-label-rubellan-remasters-now-open-for-business.748331/page-22#post-22810187 |date=Dec 20, 2019|website=SteveHoffman.com}}</ref>

On November 27, 2020, Berlin released their ninth album, ''Strings Attached'', which includes re-recordings of previous songs backed by a full orchestra.<ref name="Forbes-Strings-Attached">{{cite web |title=Berlin's Latest Album 'Strings Attached' Marks An Unlikely Alliance Of Synths And Orchestra|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidchiu/2020/12/09/berlins-latest-album-marks-an-unlikely-alliance-of-synths-and-orchestra/?sh=5ae03a666ad5 |work=Forbes Media |access-date=December 13, 2020}}</ref>
