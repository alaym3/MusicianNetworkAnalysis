=== ''RARE'' and ''Ultrarare'' (2017–2018) ===
In early 2017 worked together with producer Sam Pura to record the album ''[[Rare (Hundredth album)|RARE]]'', released June 16, 2017 on Hopeless Records.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Goodwin|first=Lucy|date=2017-06-01|title=We Asked Hundredth Questions Based Off Of Your "Hate Comments"|url=https://www.impericon-mag.com/en/hundredth-react/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-16|website=Impericon Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref> It featured a stylistic change for the band, moving away from their established melodic hardcore sound and into shoegaze and indie rock. Johnson explained that “the truth is we didn't want to keep doing the same thing over and over. Churn out a ‘safe’ record to keep the train moving and food on the table. We drained our ‘hardcore’ vein on ''Free''. After it, we felt unfulfilled and boxed in”.<ref>{{Cite web|last=AltPress|date=2017-06-01|title=Chadwick Johnson on Hundredth's abandonment of hardcore|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/hundredth_rare_chadwick_johnson_hardcore_paycheck/|access-date=2021-01-30|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Rare'' was included in the Top 50 Albums of 2017 by Stereogum.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.stereogum.com/featured/the-50-best-albums-of-2017/ |title = The 50 Best Albums of 2017|date = 2017-12-05}}</ref> Hundredth was praised to be “well on their way into the indie pantheon of impenetrable rock acts” by Alternative Press.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Hill|first=John|date=May 30, 2017|title=Hundredth Throw Their Metalcore Past Into a 'Hole'|url=https://clrvynt.com/hundredth-interview/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-30|website=CLRVYNT|language=en}}</ref>

In late 2017 vocalist/guitarist Chadwick Johnson announced a solo project Pure Violet<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.altpress.com/news/hundredth_pure_violet_solo_singles/ |title = Hundredth vocalist releases two airy new songs as a solo artist—listen|date = 2017-11-07}}</ref> with the premiere of two singles “Garden” and “Numb” on Stereogum.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.stereogum.com/1970661/pure-violet-garden-numb/premiere/ |title = Hundredth frontman Chadwick Johnson unveils Pure Violet|date = 2017-11-07}}</ref>

On June 15, 2018, Hundredth released ''Ultrarare'', a remix/reinterpretation EP of their 2017 album ''Rare''. The 7-song EP was produced, mixed, & mastered by vocalist Chadwick Johnson. Speaking on the EP's inspiration, Johnson said he "started toying around on a couple of the songs using synths instead of guitars and the songs went to a completely different place. ''Rare'' is a rush. Ultrarare is the comedown.” <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.altpress.com/news/hundredth-ultrarare-remix-album/ |title = Hundredth release 'Ultrarare,' a collection of remixes from 'RARE'|date = 2018-06-15}}</ref>

The band announced on November 17, 2018 through their social networks that they had parted ways with [[Hopeless Records]] and that they were "officially an independent band" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/HUNDREDTH/status/1063875102255722496|title=WE ARE OFFICIALLY AN INDEPENDENT BAND|last=HUNDREDTH|date=2018-11-17|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Buggy|first=Zach|date=2020-10-11|title=ALBUM REVIEW: Hundredth - Somewhere Nowhere|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/album-review-hundredth-somewhere-nowhere/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-16|website=DEAD PRESS! {{!}} It's more than "just music" to us|language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== ''Somewhere Nowhere'' (2019 - present) ===
On May 10, the band teased the upcoming song "Whatever". On May 22, the single "Whatever" premiered on Stereogum, who said of the track: "Befitting its influences, the song’s hook is beyond catchy, managing to land with absolute grace in the echo-drenched, reverb-soaked space."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2043888/hundredth-whatever/premiere/|title=Hundredth - "Whatever"|date=2019-05-22|website=Stereogum.com|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref> The digital single "Whatever" was officially released to all streaming platforms on May 24, 2019. It was followed by "Leave Yourself", "Cauterize" and "Iridescent" over the course of the summer. The latter presented as an EP with the three previous tracks included.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pettigrew|first=Jason|date=2019-09-26|title=Hundredth release final single in digital series, “Iridescent”—listen|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/hundredth-iridescent/|access-date=2021-08-16|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref> 

On September 2, 2020, Hundredth announced their fifth studio album ''Somewhere Nowhere,'' which was self-released on October 9, 2020. The album's first single "Bottle It Up" was released to all streaming platforms that same day.
