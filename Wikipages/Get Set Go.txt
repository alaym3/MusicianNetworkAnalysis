'''Get Set Go''' is a band formed in 2002<ref name="popmatters"/> in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles, California]]. They are generally seen as [[indie rock]]. Their main songwriter is Michael "Mike TV" Torres. The band is known for their tendency to mix dark lyrics with upbeat or catchy melodies. Their songs have been featured on several episodes of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', appearing on the first two volumes of the series' soundtrack with the tracks "Wait" and an amended version of "I Hate Everyone."<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|last1=Hopkin|first1=Kenyon|title=AllMusic Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/get-set-go-mn0000655740/biography|website=allmusic.com|publisher=AllMusic Guide|accessdate=December 11, 2016}}</ref>

Originally called Vermicious K, the band went through a few name changes and lineups before settling on Get Set Go.<ref name="KOK"/><ref name="popmatters">{{cite web|last1=Janella Horn|first1=Jodie|title=Ready For Primetime: An Interview With Get Set Go's Mike TV|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/ready-for-primetime-an-interview-with-go-set-gos-mike-tv/|website=popmatters.com|publisher=Pop Matters|accessdate=October 18, 2006}}</ref> Currently, Get Set Go is the solo project of Michael Torres.<ref name="nightattack">{{cite web|last1=Leon|title=Episode 137: Hang Up, Sorry!

==History==
Michael Torres initially started Get Set Go with high school friend Patrick Flores in 2002 in Highland Park, Los Angeles. The two originally recorded joke albums under the nicknames "Mike TV" and "Dr. Modo", respectively.<ref name="popmatters"/> The duo soon met drummer Amy Wood (later of [[The Dollyrots]]) and began producing music under the name Vermicious K, performing regularly at the Highland Park venue [[Mr. T's Bowl (Highland Park)|Mr. T's Bowl]]. They later changed to the band name to All Your Base Are Belong To Us (a reference to [[All your base are belong to us|the internet joke]]).<ref name="KOK">{{cite web|last1=N/A|title=Get to know Mike TV from Get Set Go|url=http://kissorkillclub.blogspot.com/2007/02/get-to-know.html|website=kissorkillclub.blogspot.com|publisher=kissorkillclub.blogspot.com|accessdate=February 14, 2007}}</ref> Later that same year the trio recorded a 3-track demo with the help of [[Ben Vaughn]] and, eventually, were signed to [[TSR Records]], a small family-owned independent label that "thought [they] had a lot of commercial appeal".<ref name="popmatters"/> The group once again changed their name, this time to Get Set Go, and released their debut album ''[[So You've Ruined Your Life]]'' in 2003.

Although the group toured nationally to promote the album,<ref name="CMJ Advertisement">{{cite web|last1=N/A|title=Advertisement for So You've Ruined Your Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6IIW48KAucC&q=get+set+go+so+you%27ve+ruined+your+life&pg=RA2-PT1|website=books.google.com|publisher=CMJ|accessdate=September 22, 2003}}</ref> they faced a lack of success, and both Wood and Flores left to pursue other careers. Torres fell into a state of [[depression (mood)|depression]] afterwards, and by 2004, was addicted to [[heroin]].<ref name="popmatters"/><ref name="AMG2"/><ref name="Today">{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Piage|title=Independent Study: Get Set Go|url=http://www.today.com/id/10932138/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/why-wallow-when-you-can-just-sing-along/#.WFHRnWQrLL8|website=today.com|publisher=Today.com|accessdate=January 26, 2006}}</ref> By 2005, Torres was able to quit and gain new members for Get Set Go, including violist Eric Summer. During this time, crew members of the show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' heard about the group, and tracks by the band were included on the shows soundtrack, most notably the track "Wait" from ''So You've Ruined Your Life''. In 2006, ''[[Ordinary World (Get Set Go album)|Ordinary World]]'' was released. Later that year, the ''Ordinary World'' track "Die, Motherfucker Die" was featured in an episode of the show ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]''. The albums ''[[Selling Out & Going Home]]'' (2007) and ''[[Sunshine, Joy & Happiness: A Tragic Tale of Death, Despair and Other Silly Nonsense]]'' (2008) followed. Like with ''So You've Ruined Your Life'', these albums faced a lack of commercial success despite constant touring.

The group left TSR Records in 2009 and subsequently established their own independent label, Square Tire Music, in 2011 in order to release their music, as well as music made by others. A [[Kickstarter]] campaign was launched to help fund the production of the band's fifth album, ''[[Fury of Your Lonely Heart]]'', which was eventually released digitally on September 20, 2011. Two extended plays, ''Loose Tongues...'' and ''Wicked Hands'' followed in 2011 and 2012, respectively. ''Tumors'', composed of material written during the ''Loose Tongues...'' era, was released as the band's sixth full-length in 2013. In May 2014, Get Set Go became the solo project of Michael Torres when he moved to [[Austin, Texas]].
