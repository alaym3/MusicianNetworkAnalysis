'''Joaquín Ramón Martínez Sabina''' (born 12 February 1949), known artistically simply as '''Joaquín Sabina''', is a singer, songwriter, and poet from the [[Andalusia]] region of southern Spain. His songs usually treat about love, heartbreaks and society with a large usage of literary figures similarly to the baroque-literature style.

He has released fourteen studio albums, two live albums, and three compilation albums. Some of his most known songs are "Calle Melancolía" ("Melancholia street"), "[[:es:19 días y 500 noches|19 días y 500 noches]]" ("19 days and 500 nights"),"Quién me ha robado el mes de Abril" ("Who stole my April month"), "Pongamos que hablo de Madrid" ("Lets say I'm talking about Madrid"), "Y sin embargo" ("However"), "Contigo" ("With you") or "Peces de ciudad" ("City fish")

He performed both solo and with a group for his live albums, performing with [[Javier Krahe]] and [[Alberto Pérez (musician)|Alberto Pérez]] in La mandrágora, the group Viceversa in a 1986 concert, and with [[Joan Manuel Serrat]] in ''Dos pájaros de un tiro'' (Two birds with one stone).

Sabina suffered a stroke in 2001 and although he physically recovered, he entered a deep depression which resulted in a four-year-long concert hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/09/23/espectaculos/c-00811.htm|title=Este disco es la crónica de una depresión|last=Clarin.com|website=www.clarin.com}}</ref> He recovered and released his eighteenth album, ''Alivio de Luto'', in November 2005 and in 2009 he released his album, ''Vinagre y rosas''. In 2012 he released his latest album in collaboration with [[Joan Manuel Serrat]]: ''La Orquesta Del Titanic''.

On June 29, 2020, Sabina married Jimena Coronado in a private ceremony in Madrid <ref>{{cite web|last=elpais.com|title=Joaquín Sabina se casa en secreto con Jimena Coronado: "Estoy feliz"|url=https://elpais.com/gente/2020-06-29/joaquin-sabina-se-casa-en-secreto-con-jimena-coronado.html?utm_source=Facebook&ssm=FB_CM&fbclid=IwAR0Vw_qxVGfgwor59zOv5sE0rhgAb9LxQcEd5tmOVrn6vaG02NxEl0YOouc#Echobox=1593427206|website=www.clarin.com}}</ref>

==Biography and career==

===Early years===
Joaquín Sabina was born in [[Úbeda]], in the [[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Province of Jaén]]. He is the second son of Adela Sabina del Campo and Jerónimo Martínez Gallego. His father was a policeman.
He attended a [[Carmelite]] primary school and he started writing his first poems and composing music at the age of 14. He was part of a band called ''Merry Youngs'' which imitated singers such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]], as well as many others.

He attended a high school run by the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] and during this period he began reading works by [[Fray Luis de León]], [[Jorge Manrique]], [[José Hierro]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[James Joyce]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]].

After completing high school, his father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a police officer but he refused, saying that he preferred the guitar. In his song "La del pirata cojo" he says he fantasizes about living different lives, but he would not even joke about becoming a police officer.

===Exile in London===
He then enrolled in the [[University of Granada]], reading [[philology]] in the faculty. There, he read the poetry of [[Pablo Neruda]] and [[César Vallejo]]. Sabina lived at first with a woman called Lesley and started to prepare his thesis.

His revolutionary ideology led him to be related to the anti-[[fascist]] groups. In 1970, he began collaborating with the magazine ''Poesía 70'', sharing pages with {{ill|Carlos Cano (singer-songwriter)|es|Carlos Cano|lt=Carlos Cano}} and [[Luis Eduardo Aute]], he then left the university, going into exile in London using a fake passport under the name Mariano Zugasti, to avoid persecution from [[Francisco Franco]]'s government after throwing a [[Molotov cocktail]] into a government building. That same year, his father received an order to arrest Sabina due to his anti-Franco ideals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guitarra.net/sabina/biografia.htm|title=Biografia Joaquin Sabina|website=Guitarra.net|language=es|trans-title=Biography of Joaquin Sabina|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817140449/http://guitarra.net/sabina/biografia.htm|archive-date=17 August 2001|url-status=dead|access-date=21 December 2017}}</ref>

In 1975, Sabina started writing songs and singing at local bars. In a local bar called "Mexicano-Taverna" Sabina performed in the presence of [[George Harrison]], who was celebrating his birthday. The ex-Beatle then gave Sabina a five-pound note as tip, which Sabina still preserves to this day. When Franco's dictatorship ended in 1975, Sabina returned to Spain and joined the army but, feeling imprisoned, he married, to be able to sleep outside the barracks.

===After the return===
Sabina's first album, ''Inventario'' ''(Inventory)'' was released in 1978 by a small label Movieplay. He describes this album "as his own version of death metal", but the album largely went unnoticed. Afterwards, he moved to the powerful [[CBS]] (today Sony) and released ''[[Malas compañías]]'' ''(Bad Companies)''. This album gave Sabina his first number-one hit single "Pongamos que hablo de Madrid"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joaquinsabina.net/2005/10/26/pongamos-que-hablo-de-madrid/|title=Pongamos que hablo de Madrid|date=26 October 2005}}</ref> (Let's say I'm talking about Madrid), and the artist attained wide recognition. He released a live album called ''La mandrágora'' ''(The Mandrake)'', sharing the spotlight with bandmates Javier Krahe and Alberto Pérez. The trio enjoyed great popularity due to their participation in a TV program. ''La Mandrágora'' was controversial due to the racy and political content of the lyrics.

Sabina released his third album ''[[Ruleta Rusa]]'' ''(Russian Roulette)'' in 1984. In this album the singer evolved from the typical singer-songwriter style to Rock music with a harder sound and with presence of new instruments such as electric guitars. One of the most popular songs of this album was "Pisa el acelerador" (Step on the accelerator), which was the first maxi single of this album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/es/Joaqu%C3%ADn-Sabina-Pisa-El-Acelerador/release/1356782|title=Joaquín Sabina – Pisa El Acelerador|website=Discogs|language=es|access-date=13 May 2018}}</ref>

=== Success ===
In 1985 Sabina left CBS and released, this time under [[Ariola Records|Ariola]], ''Juez y Parte'' ''(Judge and Side)'' his fourth studio album in which he teamed up with the band Viceversa, which was led by Pancho Varona, who would turn into one of his closest friends and producer of many of Sabina's future albums. In this release, which shows a more modern production with the use of synthesisers and keyboards, it was included another popular song entitled ''"Princesa" (Princess)'', arguably the most popular one of this release.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.diariosabina.com/juez-y-parte-1985/|title=Juez y parte (1985) – Diario Sabina|work=Diario Sabina|access-date=13 May 2018|language=es-ES}}</ref>

His political views led him to take part in the anti-[[NATO]] movement. He later released ''Joaquín Sabina y Viceversa en directo'', his first live album, which turned definitely into his commercial breakthrough. This album which was recorded in the Salamanca theatre in [[Madrid]], the singer collaborated with other singers such as Javier Krahe, [[Javier Gurruchaga]], and [[Luis Eduardo Aute]] amongst others.

In 1987 Sabina released his fifth studio album, ''Hotel, Dulce Hotel'' ''(Hotel, Sweet Hotel)'', which sold a large number of records in Spain (400.000 copies).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.diariosabina.com/hotel-dulce-hotel-1987/|title=Hotel, dulce hotel (1987) – Diario Sabina|work=Diario Sabina|access-date=15 May 2018|language=es-ES}}</ref> One of the most popular songs of this record was the track "Así estoy yo sin ti" (That's how I am without you) for which was released a promotional video, the first one of his musical career.<ref>{{Citation|last=joaquinsabinaVEVO|title=Joaquin Sabina – Asi Estoy Yo Sin Ti (Videoclip)|date=16 December 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VKGMhD5zUA|access-date=15 May 2018}}</ref> That success led to his next album ''El Hombre del Traje Gris'' ''(The Man in the Gray Suit)'', in which he would count with Antonio García de Diego, a new collaborator and also another of his fellow friends.  After releasing this album, Sabina undertook a successful tour in Latin America. This record was followed by the release of ''Mentiras Piadosas'' ''(Pious Lies)'' in 1990.

Two years later, in 1992, the performer reached a new sales record with the release of ''Física y Química'' ''(Physics and Chemistry)'', which sold more than one million copies<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/fugas/2017/03/24/arrasando-hombre-68-anos/0003_201703SF24P16991.htm|title=Con más de un millón de copias vendidas se convirtió en su cúspide comercial. ¿Existe alguna persona en este país que no haya escuchado nunca Y nos dieron las diez?}}</ref> mainly thanks to the smash hit "Y nos dieron las diez" (We went on till ten o'clock)<ref>{{Citation|title=Joaquin Sabina – Y Nos Dieron las Diez (Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3OtzDWBwOo|language=en|access-date=15 May 2018}}</ref> a song with strong Mexican traditional flavour that tells the story of a summer affair. This song received such a warm welcome that has been covered by many Latin American singers. The unprecedented success led the singer to another successful tour to the Americas.

His later albums ''Esta boca es mía'' ''(This Mouth is Mine)'', ''Yo, mi, me, contigo''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joaquinsabina.net/2005/11/05/contigo/|title=Contigo|date=5 November 2005}}</ref> ''(I, my, me, with you)'' and ''19 Días y 500 Noches'' ''(19 Days and 500 Nights)'', won him wider recognition and multiple platinum albums.

After recovering from a stroke,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.los40.com/articulo/noticias/Joaquin/Sabina/drogas/solo/siento/nostalgia/l40actn01/20060317l40l40not_12/Tes/|title=Joaquín Sabina: "Por las drogas sólo siento nostalgia"|last=LOS40|date=17 March 2006}}</ref> he returned to the stage in 2002 with ''Dímelo en la Calle'' (''Tell me on the Street'' or ''Dare to say that outside''). He later released a double album called ''Diario de un peatón'' ''(A Pedestrian's Diary)'', which included both his previous album and 12 new songs, along with a book illustrated by him.

In 2005 Sabina released a new record ''Alivio de luto'' ''(Relief from Mourning )''. The album release was accompanied by a DVD that includes interviews, music videos, acoustic versions of the songs, and home-made recordings.

In 2007, he went on tour with Spanish singer [[Joan Manuel Serrat]], called ''Dos Pájaros de un Tiro'' ''(Two birds with one stone)'' and they recorded a CD of this tour, which includes the DVD of the concert and a documentary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joaquinsabina.net/2007/11/14/dvd-dos-pajaros-de-cuenta/|title=CD + DVD de la Gira de Serrat y Sabina: Dos pájaros de un tiro|date=14 November 2007}}</ref>

In 2009, he received the prize of the city of [[Madrid]] from the mayor [[Alberto Ruiz Gallardón]], who said that he was one of the most important people who had given a good image to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/madrid/noticia-jose-tomas-sabina-raul-paloma-oshea-recibiran-medalla-oro-madrid-dia-san-isidro-20090305135148.html|title=José Tomás, Sabina, Raúl y Paloma O'Shea recibirán la Medalla de Oro de Madrid el día de San Isidro|first=Europa|last=Press|date=5 March 2009}}</ref> That year, he published his 15th studio album, ''Vinagre y Rosas'' (''Vinegar and Roses''), an album in which he collaborated with his producers [[Pancho Varona]] and [[Antonio García de Diego]], and with the band [[Pereza]]. The first single from the album was the song "Tiramisu de limón" ("Lemon Tiramisu"), sung with Ruben and Leiva, the members of Pereza. For the promotional video, he collaborated with the actress and singer [[Mónica Molina]]. Finally the album was released on 14 December, entering directly at the top of the Spanish album chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/cultura/musica-00129/noticia-top-ten-ventas-cierra-2009-inamovible-20100108132324.html|title=El top ten de ventas cierra 2009 inamovible|first=Europa|last=Press|date=8 January 2010}}</ref>

==Style==
Some examples of his baroque style songwriting with a large [[metaphor]]ic usage:

'''From "Calle melancolía"'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Calle melancolía |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpFqPj2ILaQ}}</ref>
{{verse translation|lang=es
|Vivo en el número siete
calle melancolía
quiero mudarme hace años
al barrio de la alegría
pero siempre que lo intento
ha salido ya el tranvía
en la escalera me siento
a silbar mi melodía

|I live at number seven
melancholia street
for years I've been wanting to move 
to the happiness neighborhood
but every time I try
the tram has already left
I sit in the stairs
and whistle my melody}}

'''From "19 días y 500 noches'''<ref>{{cite web|title=3 dia y 8 noches (live)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmmJ1uiRiUM|access-date=4 September 2020}}</ref>
{{verse translation|lang=es
|Me abandonó
Como se abandonan los zapatos viejos
Destrozó el cristal de mis gafas de lejos
Sacó del espejo su vivo retrato
[...]
Tanto la quería
que tardé en aprender a olvidarla 
diecinueve días 
y quinientas noches

|She abandoned me
As old shoes are abandoned
She broke the glass of my distance glasses
She removed from the mirror her live portrait 
[...]
I loved her so much
that to learn to forget her it took me 
nineteen days
and five hundred nights
}}

'''From "Contigo"'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Contigo (live) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXAkzb4XT14 |access-date=4 September 2020}}</ref>

{{verse translation|lang=es
|Yo no quiero saber por qué lo hiciste
Yo no quiero contigo ni sin ti
Lo que yo quiero, muchacha de ojos tristes
Es que mueras por mí

Y morirme contigo si te matas
Y matarme contigo si te mueres
Porque el amor cuando no muere mata
Porque amores que matan nunca mueren

|I don't want to know why you did it
I don't want with or without you
what I want, girl with sad eyes
is that you die for me

And dying with you if you kill yourself
and killing myself with you if you die
because when love doesn't die it kills
because loves that kill never die.}}

'''From "Barbi superstar"'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Barbi Superstar (live) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePX0iTn5zq0 |access-date=4 September 2020}}</ref>

{{verse translation|lang=es
|Al infierno se va por atajos, jeringas, recetas
ayer, hecha un pingajo me dijo, en el tigre de un bar
"¿dónde está la canción que me hiciste cuando eras poeta?
Terminaba tan triste que nunca la pude empezar"
Por esos labios, que sabían a puchero de pensiones inmundas
Habría matado yo que cuando muero ya nunca es por amor

|You go to hell by taking shortcuts, syringes and prescriptions
yesterday, being a mess, she told me in a pub's toilet
"Where is the song you wrote me when you were a poet?
the ending was so sad that I never could start reading it (the song)"
For these lips, that tasted like filthy hostels' soup
I would've killed, now that when I die it's never because of love}}
