== Career ==
[[File:Justine Skye by Dinner Land.jpg|right|thumb|Justine Skye in 2015]]
Skye got her start at a professional singing career when she performed songs to go with the book “Rules To Rock By”. 
She is known for having made a cover about "Headlines" by [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] which received 2 million views on YouTube. In 2012 she released her very first mixtape ''Skye High''. On the mixtape, her song "Trippin" got her a significant amount of exposure. She was also known for being [[Tumblr]] famous at the time with her then boyfriend Glyn Brown who pursued fashion. They would have meet ups in the New York area in which those who were a part of their fanbase would show up and show support for their events. As she continued on her rise to fame, her debut seven-track EP, ''Everyday Living'', helped her land a deal with [[Atlantic Records]] in 2013. Her song "Hard Work" landed on [[106 & Park|BET's ''106 & Park'']] Top 10 and she also performed on an episode. She released the album ''Emotionally Unavailable'' in 2015. During that time she made the song, produced by [[Mustard (record producer)|DJ Mustard]], "Collide" that featured the rapper [[Tyga]].<ref name="thefader.com"/> In October 2015, she performed at TIDAL10X20, an event created by [[Jay-Z]] and at a [[Tommy Hilfiger]] show in Brazil. She has also made television appearances including an appearance on the final episode of ''[[House of DVF]]''.

In 2016 she left Atlantic and signed to [[Roc Nation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2016/03/24/roc-nation-signs-singer-justine-skye/ |title=Roc Nation Signs Singer Justine Skye |publisher=BallerStatus.com |date=March 24, 2016}}</ref> and [[Republic Records]]. In December 2016, she released her EP ''8 Ounces'', which featured artists such as [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]].

In October 2017, she was the source of controversy when she kneeled down during a portion of her singing of the National Anthem at the [[Barclays Arena]] in Brooklyn, New York at a [[Brooklyn Nets]] game.

Her debut album ''Ultraviolet'' was released on January 18, 2018. The album featured the singles "U Don't Know" (featuring Wizkid), "Back for More" (featuring [[Jeremih]]) and "Don't Think About It". The music video for "Don't Think About It" was released on the same day as the pre-order, December 8, and the song "Good Love" became available with the album pre-order.

In October 2018, Skye shared the video for "Build" on [[Instagram]] with an accompanying message that described an unnamed abuser who hurt her mentally and physically. At the time, Skye explained that she did not reveal her abuser's name because it would not matter to most people.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In 2021 she announced her third studio album, ''Space & Time'', would be released June 25, 2021, and the album's executive producer was [[Timbaland]].{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

==Personal life==
