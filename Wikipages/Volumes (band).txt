== History ==
===Formation, ''The Concept of Dreaming'' and ''Via'' (2009–2013)===
The band was founded in January 2009, by guitarist and songwriter Diego Farias, his older brother and vocalist Gus Farias, and producer, guitarist and song writer Daniel Braunstein. Originally, the band planned to be just a studio project until Gus insisted they form a full band upon hearing the first demo recordings, which were 30 second tracks consisting of just a riff or two.<ref name="welikeitheavy">[https://archive.today/20130428125608/http://welikeitheavy.com/2013/02/22/interview-with-volumes/ Interview with Volumes on welikeitheavy.com], zugegriffen am 4. April 2013.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/volumes-mn0001620586/biography|title=Volumes &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The trio began searching for likeminded musicians in the area to further their heavy metal, hip-hop, jazz and classical influenced music, and would go on to expand the band's lineup. Originally they intended to only have one vocalist but upon Gus’ request to have dual singers he suggested Michael Barr to be added as well as suggesting bass player Raad Soudani and drummer Chris Khoury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Volumes/+wiki|title=Volumes hometown, lineup, biography|website=Last.fm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metalcorenews.com/volumes-interview/|title=Volumes Interview – Metal Core News|website=Metalcorenews.com}}</ref> After completing their lineup, the band began work on their debut EP, 'The Concept of Dreaming', with an expected release date of December 2009. But production came to a halt when guitarist Daniel Braunstein decided to leave the band citing time constraints with university. He was soon replaced by guitarist Daniel Schwartz, and the band was able to continue working on their EP.

On September 29, 2009 the band was signed to [[Mediaskare Records]], with vocalist Gus Farias stating that the band is "..stoked to announce that we have signed to Mediaskare Records, joining a great team and roster of bands we look up to".

===Return of Barr, departure and death of Diego Farias, and "Happier?" (2020–present)===
On January 30, the band released a new single titled "holywater", confirming rumors that Michael Barr was back in the band, and revealing that guitarist Diego Farias is no longer a part of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B77mjLsF5UF/|title=Volumes (@volumesla)|date=30 January 2020|website=Instagram|access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/prodbyyaygo/status/1222649753512464385?s=21|title=yaygo (@PRODBYYAYGO)|date=30 January 2020|website=Twitter|access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref>

Later the same day, the band released a statement on social media giving more of an insight into the lineup changes, giving clarity on the departure of the Farias brothers and the arrival of Barr. They also stated that Max Schad mixed and tracked the "Holywater" whilst also providing guitar for the band. Further talking about guitarists, they said that a touring guitarist will be with them for their upcoming UK/EU tour with [[Born of Osiris]], and they will "figure out permanent guitarists when it organically happens".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/volumesband/status/1223042572102193153?s=21|title=Volumes (@volumesband)|date=31 January 2020|website=Twitter|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref>

On February 6, former vocalist Gus Farias announced on his [[Twitter]] page that his brother and former guitarist of the band, Diego, had died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/realyungyogi/status/1225365390764605440?s=21|title=Gus Farias (@RealYungYogi)|date=6 February 2020|website=Twitter|access-date=6 February 2020}}</ref> The band released their own personal statement on the band's official Twitter later the same day, reading:
{{cquote|"We are absolutely devastated by the tragic passing of Diego Farias. We are trying to cope and process this as it all seems so surreal. We send our love and thoughts to his brothers Gus and Andres, his mother and father, and his entire extended family.

As we collect our thoughts we will then be able to properly convey them more. But for now... we love you Diego, rest in power.

On May 15, the band released a single entitled "Pixelate".

On September 25, the band released the first single "Weighted" from their (at the time) untitled new album. They released its 2nd single "Get Enough" on August 13, 2021.

On October 8, 2021, the band announced their new album "Happier?" with the release of it's third single "Bend."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upsetmagazine.com/news/volumes-happier-announce|title=Volumes will release their new album 'Happier?' next month|date=11 October 2021|website=Upset|access-date=11 October 2021}}</ref> The album was released on November 19, 2021.

== Controversy ==
In an ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' article pressed in late January 2013, it was reported that Volumes had been banned from [[Rocketown]] in [[Nashville]], after vocalist Michael Barr was evicted from the venue for dedicating a song to a [[homosexuality|gay]] friend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/volumes_alleges_rocketown_staff_assaulted_vocalist_at_of_mice_men_headliner|archive-date=February 3, 2013|title=UPDATE: Alleged conflict erupts at Nashville's Rocketown between Volumes vocalist and staff - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|access-date=2 May 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203014113/tp://www.altpress.com/news/entry/volumes_alleges_rocketown_staff_assaulted_vocalist_at_of_mice_men_headliner}} }</ref> However, later reports described how Barr was escorted from the venue by security after he had assaulted crowd members whilst [[mosh|hardcore dancing]] to other bands, and that he was "looking for a fight" while doing so. Some crowd members ganged up on Barr, at which point security had arrived to the situation and ultimately escorted Barr from the venue. After being denied access back inside when attempting to re-enter the venue, Barr allegedly shouted pejorative slurs at the concert promoter working the door.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalinsider.net/rumors-and-gossip/did-volumes-singer-get-attacked-by-security-over-support-of-gay-rights|title=Did Volumes' Singer Get Attacked By Security Over Support Of Gay Rights?Metal Insider|date=January 28, 2013}}</ref> The band was still not allowed at the venue when they returned to the area three years later with a new vocalist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2016/12/10/news/volumes-remain-banned-nashville-tn-venue-three-years-later/|title=Volumes Remain Banned From Nashville, TN Venue Three Years Later|date=December 10, 2016|website=Theprp.com}}</ref>

In February 2017, vocalist Gus Farias generated controversy when he failed to deliver on paid guest spots for other bands, later offering refunds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/volumes-is-refunding-fans-after-vocalist-gus-farias-never-delivered-on-guest-spots|title=VOLUMES Is Refunding Fans After Vocalist Gus Farias Never Delivered On Guest Spots|date=6 February 2017|website=Metalinjection.net|access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>
