'''UGK''' (short for '''Underground Kingz''') was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo from [[Port Arthur, Texas]], formed in 1987, by [[Pimp C|Chad "Pimp C" Butler]] and [[Bun B|Bernard "Bun B" Freeman]]. They released their first [[major record label|major-label]] album, ''[[Too Hard to Swallow]]'', in 1992, followed by several other albums charting on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts, including the self-titled ''[[Underground Kingz]]'' album, which contained their single "[[International Players Anthem (I Choose You)]]" and debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, in August 2007. The duo has also been featured on hit singles by several other artists, such as "[[Big Pimpin']]" by [[Jay-Z]] and "[[Sippin' on Some Syrup]]" by [[Three 6 Mafia]]. Pimp C founded [[UGK Records]] in late 2005. On December 4, 2007, [[Pimp C]] died in his [[West Hollywood, California]] hotel room.

==Background==
Originally from Port Arthur, Texas UGK members Pimp and Bun were from the same town as [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Though the town of 60,000 has a significant African American population, it was not known for its rap scene. They called themselves "Underground Kingz" because their [[country rap]] style was so full of "slang and twang" they thought it inaccessible for outsiders. UGK blended "deep [[blues|bluesy]] texures, triumphant church organs, thick [[funk]] and meaty [[soul (music)|soul]]".<ref name=chicago>{{cite book |last=Westoff |first=Ben |title=Dirty South: OutKast, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, and the Southern Rappers Who Reinvented Hip-Hop |date=2011 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=1569766061 |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pgc6mAEACAAJ |access-date=3 August 2019}}</ref> 

Bun's rap style was described as a "speeding-train delivery" with lyrics that "feel sanded-down and coated by heavy lacquer". Born Bernard Freeman, his childhood nickname "Bunny" was shortened to Bun.<ref name=chicago /> 

Pimp, or Chad Butler, is the son of a trumpet player and has had an interest in music since childhood: "I come from a classical background, I came up singing [[Italian sonnets]], [[Negro spirituals]], and shit of that nature." Even before studying [[musical notation]] in school he learned to play many instruments by ear including piano, trumpet, drums and flugelhorn. His vocal style is of a "high-voiced, unstable and provocateur, as likely to slap your face as to sing you a love song". Influenced by [[Run-DMC]], he started [[Synthesizer|synthesizing]] beats to rap over after receiving a [[drum machine]] and [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] one Christmas. Following the advice of Pimp's stepfather to "put some music in that shit", Pimp decided to move beyond Run-DMC's [[bass drum|kick]]-[[snare drum|snare]] formula, opting instead for [[Roland TR-808|808s]] and especially [[hi-hat]]s.<ref name=chicago />

==Career and recordings==
In 1992, UGK was signed to [[Jive Records]] under a five-album contract, releasing their major-label debut album ''[[Too Hard to Swallow]]''.<ref>Bush, John. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p133449|pure_url=yes}} UGK biography]. [[Allmusic]]. Accessed December 9, 2007.</ref> While it featured several new recordings, it also featured several songs that had been culled from ''[[The Southern Way]]''.<ref>Jeffries, David. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r77386|pure_url=yes}} Too Hard to Swallow]. [[Allmusic]]</ref> However, several songs that had been intended to be included on the album were excised at the last minute, apparently due to their overly explicit content.  Five of these songs would surface two months before the release of ''Too Hard to Swallow'', on an [[Extended play|EP]] distributed by Bigtyme Recordz; appropriately enough, the EP was titled ''[[Banned (EP)|Banned]]''.  A popular song from the album "Pocket Full of Stones" was also included on the [[Menace II Society (soundtrack)|Menace II Society soundtrack]] in 1993.

Their second album, ''[[Super Tight]]'', was released two years later, on August 30.  Unlike their previous album, ''Super Tight'' managed to break into the [[Billboard Hot 200]] and ultimately peaked at #95; their third album, ''[[Ridin' Dirty]]'', peaked at #15.<ref name="charts and awards">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p133449|pure_url=yes}} UGK Billboard Album Chart Positions]. [[Allmusic]]. Accessed December 9, 2007</ref>  ''Ridin' Dirty'' would also be UGK's last album for the time being, as they went on a five-year hiatus not long afterward.

The year 2000 became a breakthrough year for the group.  UGK made a high-profile guest appearance on [[Jay-Z]]'s smash hit "[[Big Pimpin']]" and also appeared on [[Three 6 Mafia]]'s hit "[[Sippin' on Some Syrup]]".  Both of these collaborations greatly increased their reputation, and helped fuel anticipation for their next project {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. [[Jive Records]] failed to capitalize on this new-found interest in the duo, as their fourth album, 2001's ''[[Dirty Money (album)|Dirty Money]]'', came and went with little fanfare.

Further problems arose when [[Pimp C]] was incarcerated for an aggravated gun assault charge in 2002.<ref name="released">Harris, Chris. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1517515/20051206/ugk.jhtml UGK's Pimp C To Be Released From Prison Within A Month]. [[MTV News]]: December 6, 2005.</ref>  Throughout the time of his incarceration, [[Bun B]] carried on the UGK name by making numerous guest appearances on songs by other artists, with every appearance either mentioning Pimp C or featuring a "Free Pimp C!" or "Free the Pimp" chant. Many of UGK's peers did the same, and mentioned Pimp C in their own songs with or without [[Bun B]].<ref>Jeffries, David. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p114577|pure_url=yes}} Pimp C biography]. [[Allmusic]]. Accessed December 9, 2007</ref>  During this period, [[Jive Records]] released a ''Best of UGK'' album, as well as a [[Chopped and Screwed|Chopped & Screwed]] remix album.<ref>Jeffries, David. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r721029|pure_url=yes}} Jive Records Presents: UGK Chopped and Screwed]. [[Allmusic]]: 2004</ref>  As a result of Pimp C's incarceration, both members of UGK began solo careers out of necessity.

[[Rap-A-Lot Records]] released Pimp C's solo debut, ''[[Sweet James Jones Stories]]'', on March 1, 2005.  Bun B later released his own solo foray, ''[[Trill (album)|Trill]]'', on October 18, 2005.  It opened at #6 on the [[Billboard Hot 200]], and also peaked at #1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-hop Album chart.

On December 30, 2005, Pimp C was released from prison and was to be on parole until December 2009.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60237/rapper-pimp-c-released-from-prison Rapper Pimp C Released from Prison].

On August 7, 2007, the group released their fifth studio album, the self-titled ''[[Underground Kingz]]''. It was a [[double album]], containing 26 tracks and spanning two discs.<ref name="underground kingz">Jeffries, David. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r936767|pure_url=yes}} Underground Kingz]. [[Allmusic]]: 2007</ref>  Featured guests included [[Talib Kweli]], [[Too Short]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Z-RO]], [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Slim Thug]], [[OutKast]], as well as hip-hop legends [[Kool G Rap]] and [[Big Daddy Kane]] on a [[Marley Marl]]-produced track titled "Next Up". The album also featured [[United Kingdom|British]] rapper [[Dizzee Rascal]] on the track "Two Types of Bitches",<ref name="underground kingz"/> following UGK's guest appearance in Rascal's own album ''[[Maths + English]]'' for the track "Where's Da G's".  The album featured production by [[DJ Paul]] & [[Juicy J]], [[Jazze Pha]], [[Swizz Beatz]], [[The Runners (production duo)|The Runners]], [[Lil Jon]], fellow Texas legend [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]], and Pimp C.<ref>Cohen, Jonathan. [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56860/ugk-dropping-double-album-in-december UGK Dropping Double Album In December] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'': October 25, 2006</ref> [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]] produced the second single, "[[International Player's Anthem (I Choose You)]]". They had used a similar beat on [[Project Pat]]'s album titled ''Layin' Da Smack Down'' in 2002.

The album got a positive reception, both commercially and critically. It received a 4-star rating from Allmusic, and reached #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 200]] album charts.  "[[International Player's Anthem (I Choose You)]]" became the group's only single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop charts, where it peaked at #70.

===2007–09: Death of Pimp C and breakup===
On December 4, 2007, Pimp C was found dead at the [[Mondrian Hotel]] in [[West Hollywood, California]], after [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]] responded to a 9-1-1 call. They arrived to his sixth-floor hotel room to find him dead in bed. This was three days after he performed with [[Too Short]] at the [[House of Blues]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2007/12/04/rapper-pimp-c-found-dead-in-hollywood-hotel-room/ |title='&#39;TMZ.com'&#39; - Rapper Pimp C Found Dead(R.I.P.) in Hollywood Hotel Room (December 4, 2007) |publisher=Tmz.com |access-date=2011-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047139/ugk-rapper-pimp-c-found-dead-in-la |title='&#39;BillBoard.com'&#39; - Report: UGK Rapper Pimp C Found Dead In L.A.

[[Bun B]] was interviewed a few days later by radio DJ Madd Hatta, and an audio recording has been posted online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/audio/id.3774/title.bun-b-madd-hatta-interview |title=Bun B Interview |publisher=Hiphopdx.com |date=2007-12-07 |access-date=2011-08-05}}</ref>

In 2008, Bun B stated in an interview that there would be one last UGK album released, before he permanently becomes a solo act: "Yea, we’re still putting together this last UGK record too, because there’s a lot of music that we’ve already recorded for it," said Bun B. "I think that album itself is going to be a little bit weird."<ref>{{cite web|last=Burgess |first=Omar |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.6523/title.bun-b-says-another-ugk-album-is-forthcoming |title=Bun B Says Another UGK Album Is Forthcoming &#124; Hip Hop News > |publisher=HipHopDX.com |date=2008-03-10 |access-date=2011-08-05}}</ref> ''[[UGK 4 Life]]'' was released in 2009.
