'''Motion City Soundtrack''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band that formed in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] in 1997. The band's line-up consists of vocalist and guitarist [[Justin Pierre|Justin Courtney Pierre]], lead guitarist [[Joshua Cain]], keyboardist Jesse Johnson, bassist Matthew Taylor, and drummer Tony Thaxton. Over the course of their career, the group has toured heavily and released six [[studio album]]s, the majority on independent label [[Epitaph Records]]. The band's sound, at times described as [[pop punk]] or [[emo]], makes notable use of the [[Moog synthesizer]]. Pierre mainly handles the band's lyrics, which often touch on themes of anxiety, alienation, and relationships.

The band was founded by Cain and Pierre, and it took several years to form a stable lineup. ''[[I Am the Movie]]'', the group's debut album, was released in 2003. Their commercial breakthrough, ''[[Commit This to Memory]]'', arrived in 2005, and its follow-up ''[[Even If It Kills Me]]'' (2007) was similarly successful. For many years, the band was a staple of the [[Warped Tour]]. They briefly signed to major label [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] for ''[[My Dinosaur Life]]'' (2010), but rejoined Epitaph for ''[[Go (Motion City Soundtrack album)|Go]]'' in 2012. Their most recent effort, ''[[Panic Stations (album)|Panic Stations]]'', was released in 2015. The group disbanded the following year, but they announced a reunion in 2019.

Over the course of the early 2000s, the band continued to tour and shuffle through members.

===Breakthrough and success (2003–2006)===
After signing with Epitaph, they recorded three new songs with the bands [[Reggie and the Full Effect]] and [[Ultimate Fakebook]] for a triple split EP which was never released. The new songs were added to the second release of ''I Am the Movie'',<ref name="noisey1"/> which was released via Epitaph on June 24, 2003. Epitaph afforded the quartet wider distribution<ref name="amp04"/> and a proper budget, which allowed them to re-record several songs on the album to match their original vision.<ref name="bv04"/> During this time, the band visited the [[United Kingdom]] for the first time in 2003 while on tour with [[Sugarcult]],<ref name="gw03">{{cite news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031230093442/http://www.gigwise.com/contents.asp?contentid=664|archive-date=December 30, 2003|title=Words with: Motion City Soundtrack|author=Darren Sykes|date=June 24, 2003|work=[[Gigwise]]|url=http://www.gigwise.com/contents.asp?contentid=664|access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> followed by an inaugural stint on [[Warped Tour 2003]].<ref name="em04">{{cite news|title=''I Am the Movie'': An Interview with Motion City Soundtrack|author=Meara Jones|issue=61|work=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison|EMMIE Magazine]]|date=March 22, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530023839/http://www.emmiemagazine.com/articles/61.html|archive-date=May 30, 2006|access-date=March 29, 2016|url=http://www.emmiemagazine.com/articles/61.html}}</ref> The band continued to tour heavily into the next year, with US dates alongside [[Rufio]], [[Mae]], and [[Fall Out Boy]],<ref name="amp04"/> plus [[Simple Plan]] and [[MxPx]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67792/simple-plan-mxpx-power-punk-package|date=December 12, 2003|title=Simple Plan, MxPx Power Punk Package|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> A European leg—titled the "Totally Wicked Awesome Tour"—featured the group with Sugarcult, [[the All-American Rejects]], and [[Limbeck]].<ref name="amp04"/> That year, the band also filmed [[music video]]s for the singles "[[The Future Freaks Me Out]]" and "[[My Favorite Accident]]".<ref name="em04"/> Their fame grew concurrently with a second appearance on the [[Warped Tour 2004]], where they were considered by fans to be a "must-see" act.<ref name="cleve"/>

===Continued success (2007–2011)===

The band's follow-up, ''[[Even If It Kills Me]]'' (2007), was recorded in New York City with Eli Janney, [[Adam Schlesinger]] of [[Fountains of Wayne]], and [[Ric Ocasek]] of [[the Cars]]. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. "He just confused me the whole time," said Pierre later, who noted that he was afraid to disclose that the experience was a "bum-out."<ref name="noisey"/> Pierre struggled with [[writer's block]] during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful.<ref name="noisey"/> During this time, Pierre's substance issues nearly disbanded the group. "I think it's an understatement to say it is tough to be tied to Justin's emotions," Cain remarked at the time.<ref name="vindy">{{cite news|author=John Benson|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2007/dec/07/motion-city-deals-with-singer8217s-issues/|title=Motion City deals with singer's issues|newspaper=[[The Vindicator]]|date=December 7, 2007|access-date=July 15, 2019}}</ref> Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse.<ref name="star"/> The band was apart for a six-week stretch in mid-2007, marking their longest break apart in five years.

''Even If It Kills Me'' was released on September 18, 2007 and represented a large leap from the group's last chart performance: it peaked at number 16 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number one on the magazine's Independent Albums chart.<ref name="ind"/><ref name="bb200">{{cite web|title=Motion City Soundtrack – Chart history|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/311845/motion-city-soundtrack/chart|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> "[[This Is for Real (song)|This Is for Real]]" became their best-charting single, peaking at number 48 in [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Gavin|title=Australia's Music Charts 1988-2010|year=2011|publisher=Moonlight Publishing|location=Mt.

Motion City signed a multiple-album deal with [[Columbia Records]] several months before releasing their previous album. Following the move, the guitarist Joshua Cain said, "It just felt right to make the move when there was the right interest there."<ref name="Ready" /> With the new signing, the band's promotional team aimed to develop a balance between the benefits of a new major label and their previous grass-roots approach.<ref name="Ready">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266506/motion-city-soundtrack-ready-to-ignite-dino-mite|title=Motion City Soundtrack Ready To Ignite 'Dino'-mite|work=Billboard|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|last=Leebove|first=Laura|date=4 December 2009|access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> Their next album saw the band reunite with producer Mark Hoppus, and the album was mostly recorded at his studio in North Hollywood, Opra Music, between April and June 2009.

During their three-year break, all of the members moved to different states and pursued different interests. Pierre continued to record music and tour as a solo act, issuing his debut effort ''[[In the Drink]]'' in 2018, which Cain assisted him in producing. The following June, the band announced their reformation with a U.S. tour.

The band's musical style is widely recognizable by its unique blend of [[pop punk]] with the [[Moog synthesizer]]. The usage of the Moog stems from Cain, who first heard the instrument employed on the Rentals' album ''[[Return of the Rentals]]'' (1995). He subsequently bought a cheap Moog at a pawn shop and wanted it to be an integral part of Motion City upon their formation.<ref name="vw">{{cite news|url=http://www.vueweekly.com/motion_city_soundtrack/|author= Bryan Saunders|title=Motion City Soundtrack|date=July 17, 2008|work=[[Vue Weekly]]|access-date=March 29, 2016}}</ref> Johnson became known for his signature "Moogstand" in live performances, which consisted of a handstand on the instrument.<ref name="vw"/> The group has been widely attributed to a number of different genres, including [[pop rock]],<ref name="ss16"/> [[power pop]],<ref name="AM"/> [[indie rock]],<ref name=newsrec>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.newsrecord.org/media/storage/paper693/news/2004/11/15/ArtsEntertainment/Motion.City.Soundtrack.Boards.A.PopPunk.Train-804328.shtml|title=Motion City Soundtrack boards a pop-punk train|publisher=The News Record.org|last=Miller|first=Jeff|date=November 15, 2004|access-date=July 31, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117183228/http://media.www.newsrecord.org/media/storage/paper693/news/2004/11/15/ArtsEntertainment/Motion.City.Soundtrack.Boards.A.PopPunk.Train-804328.shtml|archive-date=January 17, 2008}}</ref> [[emo]],<ref name="diff"/> and [[pop punk]].<ref name="AM"/> Joshua Cain dismissed this latter label, remarking, "I definitely wouldn't consider us a pop-punk band.

===Lyrics===
[[File:Justin_Pierre_2010.jpg|thumb|left|Justin Pierre, frontman and primary lyricist for the band, in 2010.]]

Most of Motion City Soundtrack's lyrical content was written by lead vocalist, Justin Pierre.<ref name="noisey" /><ref name="pga" /> This material was largely affected by his personal life and past experiences. Songs came about in myriad ways. Many times, the band would write music first that Pierre would set words to, other times Pierre would write a song on guitar with words and bring it to the band.<ref name="ol"/> Pierre could often "spend hours and days and weeks and months on lyrics—sometimes they come quick, sometimes they don't come at all," he said. He noted that he had a screenwriting teacher in film school that taught him to "write what you know," but in his case, he could only write about "being a self-obsessed pessimistic sort of loser." This led him to characterize his writing as a sort of therapy for him and a vehicle to better understand the human condition.<ref name="ol"/>
