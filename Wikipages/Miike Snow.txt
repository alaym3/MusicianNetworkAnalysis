==History==

===Early years===
Miike Snow was formed in 2007 in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. Band members [[Christian Karlsson (DJ)|Christian Karlsson]] and Pontus Winnberg were childhood friends who spent time playing in bands and working on various projects in studios throughout the city of [[Gothenburg]]. Karlsson was a former member of the Swedish hip-hop band Goldmine, who toured with [[The Fugees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cafe.se/?id=658599 |title=Café.se |publisher=Cafe.se |access-date=21 February 2011}}</ref> After separate moves to Stockholm, they reunited in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Karlsson and Winnberg collaborated under the moniker [[Bloodshy & Avant]]<ref name="KTC">{{cite web|url=http://killingthecabinet.com/interview-miike-snow/|title=Interview: Miike Snow with Pontus Winnberg|author=KTC MGMT|work=Killing the Cabinet|date=23 October 2012}}</ref> and enjoyed a significant amount of success as producers and songwriters. They have worked with artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Kelis]], [[Sky Ferreira]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/miike-snow-happy-to-you|title=Miike Snow: ''Happy to You''|work=Slant Magazine|first=Kevin|last=Liedel|date=26 March 2012}}</ref> and won a [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording]] for [[Britney Spears]]' track "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]".<ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120385043|title=The Decade in Music: Britney Spears' "Toxic" (2004) — NPR|year=2009|last=Schriefer|first=Amy|publisher=[[NPR]]. National Public Radio, Inc.}}</ref>

In 2004, while working on writing a pop album for [[Britney Spears]], Karlsson and Winnberg met the third band member, American songwriter [[Andrew Wyatt]]. Wyatt reports "I was in Sweden visiting, and someone told me that I should hook up with these two guys. Actually, it turns out I'd met Christian in the studio maybe a year before, but we only actually recently remembered that".<ref name="Interview Magazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/miike-snow|title=Putting the I's in Miike Snow|work=Interview Magazine}}</ref>

The name "Miike Snow" is said to have come from one of their friends named Mike Snow.<ref name="KTC"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/09/24/need-know-miike-snow|title=Need to Know: Miike Snow|first=Dustin|last=Fitzharris|date=24 September 2009|work=Out Magazine}}</ref> Contrary to suggestions or statements to the converse,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.qthemusic.com/2012/03/qa_miike_snow_-_yeah_we_know_h.html|title=Q&A: Miike Snow|publisher=QTheMusic|date=14 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301180747/http://news.qthemusic.com/2012/03/qa_miike_snow_-_yeah_we_know_h.html|archive-date=1 March 2014}}</ref> the spelling of "Miike" does not derive from the Japanese film director [[Takashi Miike]];<ref name="KTC"/> Pontus Winnberg states that, "When we sat down to come up with a name one of us got an email from a mutual friend by the name Mike Snow. We liked it and added the extra "I" because we liked the look of it. We once found a possible classic Swedish film on our tour bus once, called ''Jävligt Jagad''. It's a bit like if [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]]'s ancestors would make a movie inspired by Takashi Miike".<ref name="KTC"/> Miike Snow have, however, indicated that they are fans of Miike's work, specifically noting ''[[Audition (1999 film)|Audition]]'', ''[[Visitor Q]]'', ''[[13 Assassins (2010 film)|13 Assassins]]'', and ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]''.<ref name="Godman"/>

{{Main article|Miike Snow (album)|l1=''Miike Snow'' (album)}}
''[[Miike Snow (album)|Miike Snow]]'' is Miike Snow's eponymous debut album. It was recorded in Stockholm and released in the United States on 9 June 2009 by [[Downtown Records]]. A single for the track "[[Animal (Miike Snow song)|Animal]]" was released on 17 February 2009. Upon a UK release of the song later in the same year, the track reached number 98 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The 'Punks Jump Up' remix of "Animal" is used as the theme music for the British [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Friday Night Dinner]]''. The second single was "[[Black & Blue (Miike Snow song)|Black & Blue]]". Both singles have made the BBC Radio 1 Playlist B-List.

''[[The Guardian]]'' spoke highly of the band, saying Miike Snow's "coolly emotional pop suggests [[A-ha]] meets [[Animal Collective]]."<ref>{{cite news|author=Paul Lester |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/26/new-band-miike-snow |title=The Guardian on Miike Snow's sound |publisher=Guardian |date= 26 May 2009|access-date=21 February 2011 |location=London}}</ref> In an interview for [[Clash (magazine)|ClashMusic.com]], Wyatt revealed their unexpected popularity, saying, "I don't think our project was that thought out when we started. We just wanted to make music together. Three people just messing about. I don't think we anticipated the level of attention that it's getting right now. We didn't even think about touring when we started the album."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/live-talking-miike-snow |title=Live Talking – Miike Snow &#124; Clash Music Exclusive Interview |publisher=Clashmusic.com |date=13 August 2009 |access-date=21 February 2011}}</ref>

A remix of the song "[[Silvia (song)|Silvia]]" by DJ's [[Sebastian Ingrosso]] and [[Dirty South (DJ)|Dirty South]] was released on 2 April 2010.

Their song "In Search Of" was originally a collaboration with Crookers for the song "Remedy". The band liked the end result so much that they decided to create their own version for their album.

In 2011, Miike Snow won a [[European Border Breakers Award]] for their international success.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/culture/our-programmes-and-actions/doc1098_en.htm "Winners of the 2011 European Border Breakers Awards"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222125206/http://ec.europa.eu/culture/our-programmes-and-actions/doc1098_en.htm |date=22 February 2014 }}, ec.europa.eu.
