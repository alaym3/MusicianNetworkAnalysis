===2011–2012===
In 2011, Gala performed the new single "Lose Yourself in Me" at the show ''Dance in the Summer'' in Beirut, next to [[Taio Cruz]], [[T-Pain]], [[Dev (singer)|Dev]] and [[Dash Berlin]].

Gala's video features the ''Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre'' trained "Abdur-Rahim Jackson". The "Taste Of Me" video appears as a one single lateral dolly shot that follows five dancers including Gala interacting in an organic dance that constantly moves forward.

Inspired by her favorite director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Gala wanted to shoot a video that felt like a single take. Another reference was [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and his pioneering work in photographic studies of motion and in motion-picture projection. Different choreographers among Gala's favorites ([[Parsons Dance Company|Parsons]], [[Bob Fosse]], [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]]) are also subtly referenced in the choreography.
