'''The Vapors''' are an English [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[power pop]] band that initially existed between 1978 and 1981. They had a [[Hit record|hit]] with the song "[[Turning Japanese]]", which reached No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1980<ref name="UK">{{cite book|first= David |last= Roberts |year= 2006 |title= British Hit Singles & Albums |edition= 19th |publisher= [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Records Limited]] |location= London |page= 582 |isbn= 1-904994-10-5|title-link= British Hit Singles & Albums }}</ref> and No. 36 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

==Career==
===1978–1982===
Based in [[Guildford]], Surrey, an early version of the band was playing the Three Lions pub in [[Farncombe]] when [[The Jam]]'s bassist [[Bruce Foxton]] spotted them.<ref name="Curley">{{cite web |last1=Curley |first1=John |title=The Vapors are reuniting for their first shows in 35 years |url= http://www.goldminemag.com/blogs/vapors-reuniting-first-shows-35-years |publisher=Goldmine |access-date=18 July 2018 |date=13 September 2016}}</ref> The band's line-up stabilised with David Fenton (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Howard Smith (drums), [[Edward Bazalgette]] (lead guitar) and Steve Smith (bass). Howard Smith and Steve Smith were not related. The band was originally named The Vapours, but had removed the "u" to help garner more attention in the United States. Foxton then offered the band a few gigs and agreed to jointly manage them with John Weller (father of [[Paul Weller]]).<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|first= Stephen Thomas | last= Erlewine |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-vapors-mn0000483716/biography |title=The Vapors &#124; Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=6 August 2014|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine }}</ref> The Vapors were then offered a slot supporting the Jam on the [[Setting Sons]] tour in 1979.

The band signed to United Artists, releasing their first single, "Prisoners", at the end of 1979, but it failed to chart. Their second single, "[[Turning Japanese]]", is the song for which they are best remembered. The track was produced by the Jam's producer [[Vic Coppersmith-Heaven]] and reached number 3 in the UK<ref name="UK"/> and number 1 in Australia. It was also a top-ten hit in Canada and New Zealand, and reached the top 40 in the United States. "Turning Japanese" was believed to [[Euphemism|euphemistically]] refer to [[masturbation]],<ref>{{cite web| first= Stewart| last= Mason |url= http://www.allmusic.com/song/turning-japanese-mt0001779950 |title=Turning Japanese – The Vapors |publisher= AllMusic |access-date=31 January 2014}}</ref> although Fenton (the song's writer) denied that claim in an interview on [[VH1]]. He did, however, say he wished to thank whoever first came up with that interpretation, as he felt the salacious rumour about what the song 'really' meant may have been what made it a hit.<ref name="Kim">{{cite web |last1= Kim |first1=Kristen Yonsoo |title=One-Hit Wondering - The Vapors |url= https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/rdvqwr/one-hit-wondering-the-vapors |publisher=Noisey |website= vice.com |access-date= 18 July 2018 |date=6 September 2012}}</ref> The follow-up singles "News at Ten" and "Jimmie Jones" both peaked at number 44 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="UK"/>

The band released two albums: ''[[New Clear Days]]'' (1980) and ''[[Magnets (album)|Magnets]]'' (1981). ''New Clear Days'' contained "Turning Japanese" and displayed a [[new wave music|new wave]] sound with socially conscious lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r51907|pure_url=yes}}|title=New Clear Days - The Vapors|publisher= AllMusic}}</ref> That album reached the middle of the charts in the UK, Canada, and US. ''Magnets'' revealed a [[power pop]] sound and darker lyrics, with the song "Jimmie Jones" making reference to [[cult]] leader [[Jim Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r51908|pure_url=yes}}|title=Magnets - The Vapors|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> That album sold poorly and the band broke up in 1982.<ref name= "allmusic"/> Fenton alleged in a later interview with ''[[Record Collector]]'' magazine that lack of record label support was the chief reason for the band's split, while a planned single release was cancelled without explanation.<ref name="Kim" />

After the Vapors broke up, David Fenton joined the legal profession in the early 1990s, concentrating on the legal aspects of the [[music industry]], and from 1999 he worked as a London-based in-house solicitor for the Musicians' Union.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jake|first1=McDade|title=MUSIC LAWYER DAVID FENTON|url=http://www.attackmagazine.com/features/job-envy/music-lawyer-david-fenton/|website=Attackmagazine.com|access-date=22 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wyatt|first1=Malcolm|title=Waiting for The Vapors Return - The Dave Fenton Interview| url= https://writewyattuk.com/2016/09/15/waiting-for-the-vapors-return-the-dave-fenton-interview/|website=writewyattuk.com |publisher=Malcolm Wyatt|access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref> [[Edward Bazalgette]] became a television director; his credits include a 2005 [[BBC]] documentary about [[Genghis Khan]] and two episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0063279/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|title=Edward Bazalgette|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1= Wyatt|first1=Malcolm|title=Back and Beyond with the Vapors - The Ed Bazelgette Interview| url= https://writewyattuk.com/2016/11/17/back-and-beyond-with-the-vapors-the-ed-bazalgette-interview/|website=writewyattuk.com |publisher=Malcolm Wyatt|access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref> For many years Howard Smith ran an independent record shop, People Records in Guildford, the band's home town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recordstoreday.com/Venue/6689 |title=Venue |publisher=Record Store Day |access-date= 2015-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/howard-smith/19/497/709 |title=Howard Smith |website= linkedin.com |access-date=2015-09-29}}</ref> Steve Smith formed the band Shoot!Dispute, which appeared in [[John Peel]] sessions, and toured in support of [[Bruce Foxton]]; and later joined the rap/rock band 1ST.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
