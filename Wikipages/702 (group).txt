'''702''' (pronounced ''"Seven-Oh-Two"''), named after [[Area code 702|the area code of their hometown]] of [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], is an American girl group, with the final and most known line up consisting of Kameelah Williams and sisters Irish and LeMisha Grinstead.

The group was originally a [[quartet]] featuring the Grinstead sisters, which included identical twins Irish and Orish (born June 2, 1980, in [[Houston|Houston, TX]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VDJN-GH5|title=Orish Grinstead texas birth index|website=Familysearch.org.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V8L8-29L|title=LeMisha Grinstead Texas birth index|website=Familysearch.org.uk}}</ref> their older sister LeMisha (born June 10, 1978, in [[Houston|Houston, TX]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:V82V-H7P|title=Lemisha Grinstead Texas birth index|website=Familysearch.org.uk}}</ref> and Amelia Childs whom they debuted as featured artists on [[Subway (group)|Subway's]] hit single "[[This Lil' Game We Play]]". Amelia and Orish were removed from the group due to Mike Bivins not favoring their voices and were briefly replaced by classmates [[Tiffany Villarreal]] and Kameelah Williams. After six months before their debut single was released Tiffany would depart the group. Continuing as a trio, they released their debut single "[[Steelo]]" with great success.

Their first released album ''[[No Doubt (702 album)|No Doubt]]'' in 1996, sold 500,000 copies in the United States. In 1999 the trio released the most famous 702 song called "[[Where My Girls At?]]" on the album ''[[702 (album)|702]]'' which gained a high level of success for the group selling half a million copies in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=702&ti=Where+My+Girls+At&format=Single&type=#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum|website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]}}</ref> For undisclosed conflicting personal reasons with the record label, Kameelah Williams distanced herself from the Grinstead sisters after the release of that album, and was replaced by Cree La'More, a solo singer who Irish and LeMisha personally picked to join the group. The new line-up released a single called "Pootie Tangin'" for the [[Pootie Tang (soundtrack)|''Pootie Tang'' soundtrack]], though shortly after this, Kameelah Williams returned to the group, and for undisclosed reasons, Cree La'More left the ensemble. With the return of Kameelah Williams, they released the album ''[[Star (702 album)|Star]]'' which is mostly remembered for the single "I Still Love You". The group then disbanded in 2006. They regrouped again in 2017, and appeared at the [[2017 Soul Train Music Awards]].
