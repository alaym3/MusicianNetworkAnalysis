'''Within the Ruins''' is an American [[progressive metalcore]]/[[deathcore]] band from [[Westfield, Massachusetts]], United States. They are currently signed to [[Entertainment One Music|eOne Music]] and [[Good Fight Entertainment|Good Fight Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/archive_4789/|title=Victory signs Corpus Christi and Within The Ruins|date=26 September 2008|website=Altpress.com|access-date=6 January 2019}}</ref> The group has released six studio albums and three EPs.

==History==
Within the Ruins founding members Joe Cocchi and Kevin "Drummer" McGuill started the band during 2003.<ref name=AllMusic>{{Allmusic |id=mn0001043675 |label=Within the Ruins}}</ref> The band went through some line-up changes and finally began working on their first self-released EP entitled ''Driven by Fear'' which was completed in 2005. Followed by the release, the band began touring in late 2006 in an effort to gain exposure and label recognition. With the release of their second EP ''[[Empires (Within the Ruins EP)|Empires]]'' through Innerstrength Records the band received an offer from [[Victory Records]]. The band's debut album ''[[Creature (Within the Ruins album)|Creature]]'' was released in February 2009, followed by  their second official release entitled ''[[Invade (Within the Ruins album)|Invade]]''. ''Invade'' was released in September 2010, selling over 3000 copies in its first week. The band has most recently toured Europe with [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex]] and has been part of a number of  2011-12 festivals thus far including the Bonecrusher Fest, [[The Jamboree (music festival)|the Jamboree]], [[New England Metal and Hardcore Festival]], [[the Bamboozle]], [[South by Southwest]] and 2011's [[the Summer Slaughter Tour]]. In support of the Summer Slaughter Tour the band released a 4-song EP entitled ''[[Omen (Within the Ruins EP)|Omen]]''. The EP consists of 2 new original songs and a cover of [[Metallica]]'s "[[Fight Fire With Fire (Metallica song)|Fight Fire With Fire]]" and [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]]' "[[Carry On Wayward Son]]". In 2013 the band signed with new label eOne Entertainment and released a third album called ''[[Elite (Within the Ruins album)|Elite]]''.

On April 20, 2014, vocalist Tim Goergen was hospitalized in the band's hometown of [[Westfield, Massachusetts]] with "heart/liver complications".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/04/21/within-ruins-vocalist-tim-goergen-hospitalized/|title=Within The Ruins Vocalist Tim Goergen Hospitalized|date=21 April 2014|website=Metalsucks.net|access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref> As a result, the band was forced to miss a scheduled appearance at the "Eat Your Heart Out Fest" in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] while touring in support of fellow [[deathcore]] mainstays [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]].

The band released an official statement on the occurrence via their [[Facebook]] page:

<blockquote>"Yesterday morning Tim checked into a hospital here in Western Mass for a second time since our tour began four days ago. We will unfortunately not be performing at today's Eat Your Heart Out Fest, as we are waiting for clarity on Tim's condition and release. Tim informed us a few weeks before leaving for tour that he was experiencing chest and stomach pains. After his first doctor visit he was advised to "take it easy" if he did do the tour. At this point all we know is that he is experiencing heart/liver complications, will not be released today, but is stable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/22370/Within-The-Ruins-frontman-hospitalized|title=Within The Ruins frontman hospitalized|website=Lambgoat.com|access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Tim's recovery necessitated the band canceling the rest of their scheduled tour dates. On their [[Facebook]] page, the band released an official statement:

<blockquote>Unfortunately, at this point we have no other option but to withdraw from the remaining dates of the Whitechapel tour. Tim will be released tomorrow, but due to the seriousness of his condition he has been advised not to engage in any strenuous activity while recovering over the next few weeks. We apologize to any fans that were looking forward to seeing us, but Tim’s health comes first. We WILL be back out this summer in support of our forthcoming album. The rest of the shows are still happening so be sure to make it out and support our friends in Whitechapel, Carnifex and Cruel Hand. See you all this summer!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinsider.net/touring/within-the-ruins-drop-off-remaining-whitechapel-dates|title=Within the Ruins drop off remaining Whitechapel dates|date=23 April 2014|website=Metalinsider.net|access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

On July 8, 2014, the band released a fourth album entitled ''[[Phenomena (Within the Ruins album)|Phenomena]],'' which reached #72 on the [[Billboard 200]].

On February 15, 2015, while traveling through Pennsylvania in support of [[Suicide Silence]] on "The Stronger than Faith", the band were involved in a serious bus accident. Extreme winter conditions resulted in the band's van and trailer flipping several times on the interstate. None of the band members were injured, however their gear was completely destroyed.

Speaking on the incident, Joe Cocchi stated:

<blockquote>"We rolled about three times from what I can remember and landed on the median. Our van and trailer are totaled.".<ref name="metalinjection.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/bummer-alert/within-the-ruins-involved-in-horrific-van-crash-forced-to-miss-two-dates-of-tour|title=WITHIN THE RUINS Involved In Horrific Van Crash; Forced To Miss Two Dates of Tour - Metal Injection|date=16 February 2015|website=Metalinjection.net|access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Cocchi continued,

<blockquote>"All I can say is that we're happy to be alive. I don't know how, but none of us were injured. We're on the road touring because this is all we know and love, and we want to continue. Help us get back on our feet by picking up a shirt. Thank you all for the continued support.”<ref name="metalinjection.net"/></blockquote>

The band created a [[Gofundme]] page in order to help pay for the damages to their equipment.

On November 21, 2016, Within the Ruins announced their fifth full-length album, ''[[Halfway Human (album)|Halfway Human]]'', and debuted a single, "Death of the Rockstar". On March 3, 2017, the band released ''Halfway Human.'' The album debuted at number 191 on the Billboard 200, selling 4,025 copies in its first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2017/03/03/shit-that-comes-out-today-march-4-2017/|title=Shit That Comes Out Today: March 3, 2017|first=Metal|last=Matt|date=3 March 2017|website=MetalSucks|access-date=6 January 2019}}</ref>

On February 24, 2018, it was announced vocalist Tim Goergen would be leaving the band following his final performance with the band at the 2018 [[New England Metal and Hardcore Festival]] on April 21.
