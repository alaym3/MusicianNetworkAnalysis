"'''Panalo (Trap Cariñosa)'''" ({{translation|"Victory"}}) is a song by Filipino [[rapper]] Ez Mil, released on July 26, 2020 as the fifth track on the album ''Act 1''.<ref name=suddensucess>{{cite news |last1=Villa |first1=Gil |title=Ez Mil cool on sudden success, intrigues |url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2021/02/07/2075795/ez-mil-cool-sudden-success-intrigues |access-date=February 10, 2021 |work=The Philippine Star |date=February 10, 2021}}</ref><ref name="albumpage">{{cite web |title=Act 1, by Ez Mil |url=https://ezmil.bandcamp.com/album/act-1 |website=Ez Mil |access-date=February 10, 2021}}</ref>

The song became [[viral video|viral]] after [[Wish 107.5]] uploaded a performance of "Panalo" by Ez Mil on January 29, 2021 to [[YouTube]], which garnered at least 30 million views by early February 2021. "Panalo" was also met with criticism for its line describing [[Visayan]] [[History of the Philippines (900–1565)|pre-colonial era]] leader [[Lapu-Lapu]] as having been beheaded in the [[Battle of Mactan]] of 1521. In recorded history, the Visayan and his forces prevailed over the Spanish led by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. Lapu-Lapu is widely regarded as a national hero in contemporary Philippine society.

==Background==
Ez Mil wrote "Panalo" as a means to express [[Filipino pride]] citing his desire for unity among Filipinos and for "negative" sentiments to be stopped.<ref name=balitambayan>{{cite news |title=Rapper na si Ez Mil, pinagso-sorry ng mayor ng Lapu-lapu City dahil sa 'pagpugot' kay Lapulapu sa kanta |trans-title=Rapper EZ Mil, demanded by Lapu-Lapu City mayor to apologize due to Lapu-Lapu's "beheading" in song|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/balitambayan/chikamuna/775249/rapper-na-si-ez-mil-pinagso-sorry-ng-mayor-ng-lapu-lapu-city-dahil-pagpugot-kay-lapulapu-sa-kanta/story/ |access-date=February 10, 2021 |work=Balitambayan |date=February 9, 2021 |language=tl}}</ref> He also decided to incorporate [[cariñosa]] music after his mother suggested to include music [[Sampling (music)|samples]] to the song. The suggestion led Ez Mil to look into [[Traditional music of the Philippines|Filipino traditional music]], with his mother proposing to him to include [[tinikling]] music. Ez Mil settled for cariñosa since he learned the associated dance in his high school years.<ref name=hereswhy>{{cite news |last1=Malig |first1=Kaela |title=Here's why Ez Mil's rap song 'Panalo' samples Cariñosa folk dance music |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/hobbiesandactivities/774902/here-s-why-ez-mil-s-rap-song-panalo-samples-carinosa-folk-dance-music/story/ |access-date=February 10, 2021 |work=GMA News |date=February 7, 2021 |language=en}}</ref> Ez Mil also used [[artistic license]] by including a line that mentions "[[Lapu-Lapu]]'s [[Decapitation|beheading]] in [[Mactan]]", despite no historical records of the Visayan chieftain's death in the 1521 [[Battle of Mactan]], as a means to generate [[buzz (marketing)|buzz]] with his song.<ref name=suddensucess/>

==Reception==
"Panalo" was released in July 2020 with relatively little reception until the performance of the song was uploaded to [[YouTube]] on January 29, 2021. The performance was uploaded as a video under the title "Ez Mil performs ‘Panalo’ LIVE on the Wish USA Bus" on [[Wish 107.5]]'s YouTube channel. The YouTube video garnered at least 30 million views by February 9, 2021.<ref name="tampok">{{cite news |last1=Olea |first1=Jerry |title=Kapuso shows na tampok si Ez Mil, tumaas ang ratings; ASAP Natin 'To, mas mataas sa A2Z kumpara sa TV5 |url=https://www.pep.ph/pepalerts/pep-troika/156592/kapuso-shows-ez-mil-asap-ratings-a4118-20210209?ref=home_feed_1 |access-date=February 10, 2021 |work=PEP.ph |publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal, Inc. |date=February 9, 2021 |language=tl}}</ref> 

Following the "Panalo" performance video becoming viral in early 2021, the song was also met with criticism, particularly for depicting a historically inaccurate account of Lapu-Lapu's beheading.

The city council of [[Lapu-Lapu City|Lapu-Lapu]] proposed a resolution condemning the lyrics of "Panalo" which it viewed as "historically inaccurate, if not demeaning to our [[National hero of the Philippines|National Hero]]". The proposed resolution also seeked to urge for the rectification of the song's lyrics and for Ez Mil to publicly apologize to the city's residents.<ref name=resolutioncondeming/> Initially, Lapu-Lapu City Mayor [[Junard Chan]] wanted Ez Mil to be declared as ''[[Persona non grata (Philippines)|persona non grata]]'' but withdrew such plans and proposed the city council to pass the resolution urging the rapper to revise his song's lyrics instead.<ref name="chanbacksoff">{{cite news |last1=Inso |first1=Futch Anthony |title=Chan backs off from persona non grata move against rapper, slams 'Panalo' song instead, seeks public apology |url=https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/362664/chan-backs-off-from-persona-non-grata-move-vs-rapper-slams-panalo-song-instead-seeks-public-apology |access-date=February 10, 2021 |work=Cebu Daily News |date=February 8, 2021 |language=en, ceb}}</ref>

Ez Mil apologized to those who felt offended by the song by him putting "inaccurate sources" from Philippine history, but acknowledged that his song "got people talking" due to the contentious line.<ref name=balitambayan/> He also said that he would not be revising the lyrics of the song since it would "ruin the integrity of the recording".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dumaua |first1=Mario |title=Ez Mil reiterates apology for historical error in lyrics of 'Panalo' but will still not alter lines of viral hit |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/02/09/21/ez-mil-reiterates-apology-for-historical-error-in-lyrics-of-panalo-but-will-still-not-alter-lines-of-viral-hit |access-date=February 10, 2021 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=February 9, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

The [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] issued a statement that while it welcomes new songs that inform people on Philippine history, that songs must me made without "compromising history" and emphasizes the fact that "Lapu-Lapu was definitely not killed in the Battle of Mactan" and characterized the battle as a victory of the ancestors of Filipinos led by him.<ref name=nhcp>{{cite news |title=National Historical Commission has this to say about Ez Mil's lyrics about Lapu-Lapu |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/life/02/10/21/national-historical-commission-has-this-to-say-about-ez-mils-lyrics-about-lapu-lapu |access-date=February 10, 2021 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=February 10, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>
