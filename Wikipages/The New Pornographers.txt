'''The New Pornographers''' are a Canadian [[indie rock]] band, formed in 1997 in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Presented as a [[musical collective]] of singer-songwriters and musicians from multiple projects, the band has released eight studio albums to critical acclaim for their use of multiple vocalists and elements of [[power pop]] incorporated into their music.

==History==
The New Pornographers' name was chosen by [[A. C. Newman|Carl Newman]], who has said that he came up with it after watching a Japanese film called ''[[The Pornographers]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/Articles/47784/The-New-Pornographers:-Canadian-Blockbuster.html |title=The New Pornographers: Canadian Blockbuster |last=Handler|first=Shane |date=1 November 2005 |access-date=27 September 2007 |publisher=Glide Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014111806/http://www.glidemagazine.com/Articles/47784/The-New-Pornographers:-Canadian-Blockbuster.html |archive-date=14 October 2007}}</ref>  The band has released eight albums to date: ''[[Mass Romantic]]'' (2000), ''[[Electric Version]]'' (2003), ''[[Twin Cinema]]'' (2005), ''[[Challengers (album)|Challengers]]'' (2007), ''[[Together (New Pornographers album)|Together]]'' (2010), ''[[Brill Bruisers]]'' (2014), ''[[Whiteout Conditions]]'' (2017), and ''[[In the Morse Code of Brake Lights]]'' (2019). A live album recorded on their 2006 tour is available only at concerts and on the band's website. In 2005, the band was the subject of [[Reginald Harkema]]'s documentary film ''Better Off in Bed''.<ref>"Harkema's road rockumentary inspired by the Rolling Stones". ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', July 22, 2005.</ref>

The New Pornographers' first four albums each placed in the top 40 on ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s [[Pazz & Jop]] year-end poll of hundreds of music reviewers. From 2000 to 2006, either a New Pornographers' album or a solo album from one of the band's members ranked in the top 40 on the list each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/index.php |title=Pazz & Jop awards from |publisher=robertchristgau.com |access-date=2009-07-25}}</ref> In 2007, ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine ranked the New Pornographers' first album, ''Mass Romantic'', the 24th best indie album of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=2981 |title=100 Greatest Indie-Rock Albums of all time, No.&nbsp;30&nbsp;– No.&nbsp;21, from |publisher=Blender.com |date=2007-11-15 |access-date=2009-07-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409014151/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=2981 |archive-date=2008-04-09 }}</ref> In 2009, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked the band's second studio album, ''Electric Version'', No.&nbsp;79 in the "100 Best Albums of the Decade".<ref>{{Cite news | title = Rolling Stone lists Top 100 of decade | publisher = CBC News | date = 2009-12-10| url = http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/12/10/rolling-stone-top-music-decade.html | access-date = 2 Oct 2010}}</ref>

All of the New Pornographers' original members were prominent within the Vancouver music scene prior to forming the band. [[Kathryn Calder]], who is also Newman's niece, joined the band in 2005 largely as a live replacement for [[Neko Case]], whose solo career often left her unavailable to perform with the band. Calder's first lead vocals for the band were on 2007's ''[[Challengers (album)|Challengers]]'', singing the lead on "Failsafe" and sharing the lead with Newman on "Adventures in Solitude".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 2009, the New Pornographers contributed a cover of the [[Destroyer (band)|Destroyer]] song "Hey, Snow White" to the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. The band released their fifth album, ''[[Together (New Pornographers album)|Together]]'', on May 4, 2010, on [[Matador Records]]. The album includes collaborations from [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]], [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]]'s Zach Condon, and [[Okkervil River]]'s [[Will Sheff]].<ref>{{Cite web| last = Lindsay| first = Andrew| title = The New Pornographers reveal album details| publisher = Stereokill.net| date = 22 Feb 2010| url = http://stereokill.net/2010/02/the-new-pornographers-reveal-album-details/| access-date = 1 Oct 2010| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100528224325/http://stereokill.net/2010/02/the-new-pornographers-reveal-album-details/| archive-date = 2010-05-28}}</ref>

In 2012, the New Pornographers contributed a cover of the song "Think About Me" for the [[Fleetwood Mac]] tribute CD called ''Just Tell Me That You Want Me'' released by Hear Music. The band's sixth album, ''[[Brill Bruisers]]'', was released on August 26, 2014.<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/55523-the-new-pornographers-announce-new-album-brill-bruisers-share-title-track-tour/ |title=The New Pornographers Announce New Album Brill Bruisers, Share Title Track, Tour |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=June 10, 2014 |access-date=May 14, 2016 |last=Gordon |first=Jeremy}}</ref> The album was their highest charting to date in the United States, peaking at #13 on the ''[[Billboard 200|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]].<ref name="Billboard Charts" />

On January 26, 2017, the New Pornographers announced their seventh album, ''[[Whiteout Conditions]],'' would be released on April 7. The album was preceded by the single "High Ticket Attractions".<ref name="whiteout">{{cite web|last1=Helman|first1=Peter|title=The New Pornographers&nbsp;– "High Ticket Attractions"|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1921775/the-new-pornographers-high-ticket-attractions/music/|website=[[Stereogum]]|access-date=27 January 2017|date=26 January 2017}}</ref> The album is the first to feature drummer Joe Seiders as a full-time member after replacing drummer Kurt Dahle in mid-2014.

{{cquote|he [Bejar] was right in the middle of doing [[ken (album)|a Destroyer record]]... [w]hich was something we’d narrowly skirted for our whole career. I’m always amazed that we managed to. Sometimes we avoided Destroyer, sometimes Destroyer avoided us, but eventually we hit at the same time. It wasn’t anything weird.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1930395/qa-a-c-newman-on-canadian-healthcare-dan-bejar-and-the-new-pornographers-whiteout-conditions/franchises/interview/|title=Q&A: A.C.

On November 29, 2018, A.C. Newman announced via Twitter that he had begun work on a future New Pornographers album.<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=ACNewman |number=1068318040775897089 |title=Hey, working on a new @TheNewPornos album everybody.}}</ref> On August 2, 2019, the band announced via Twitter that it would release its new album, ''[[In the Morse Code of Brake Lights]]'', on September 27, and released its first single from the album, "Falling Down the Stairs of Your Smile".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-new-pornographers-falling-down-the-stairs-of-your-smile-866611/ |title=The New Pornographers Announce New Album, Share Lead Single |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2 August 2019 |first=Claire |last=Shaffer |access-date=30 October 2021}}</ref> In a press release for the album, Dan Bejar is described as a "former (and possibly future) member" of the band. The new press photos for the band include vocalist/violinist Simi Stone, officially inducting her into the band after being an auxiliary touring member since 2015.

In July 2021, the band announced a North American tour where they would play ''Mass Romantic'' and ''Twin Cinema'' in full across simultaneous nights, as well as a reissue of ''Mass Romantic'' on vinyl. This announcement also confirmed the return of Bejar to the band, as well as the departure of both Thurier and Stone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Minsker |first1=Evan |title=The New Pornographers Announce Mass Romantic Reissue, Full Album Tour |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/the-new-pornographers-announce-mass-romantic-reissue-full-album-tour/ |date=13 July 2021 |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=14 July 2021}}</ref>
