'''Karyn Layvonne White''' (born October 14, 1965) is an American singer who was popular during the late 1980s and early 1990s. She is known for several hit singles including "[[Superwoman (Karyn White song)|Superwoman]]" (1988), "Love Saw It" (1988),<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/karyn-white-mw0000195520 |title=Karyn White - Karyn White &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=AllMusic}}</ref> "[[Secret Rendezvous (song)|Secret Rendezvous]]" (1989), "[[The Way You Love Me (Karyn White song)|The Way You Love Me]]" (1988), and the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Hot 100]] No. 1 single "[[Romantic (song)|Romantic]]" (1991).

==Early life==
White was born in Los Angeles to Vivian and Clarence White. She is the youngest of five children. She sang in a church choir and worked as a backing singer, then sang on [[Jeff Lorber]]'s 1986 ''Private Passion'' single "Facts of Love", "True Confessions" and "Back in Love" before signing to [[Warner Bros. Records]].

==Career==
White's self-titled debut album ''[[Karyn White (album)|Karyn White]]'' was released in 1988.<ref name="auto" /> It was produced by [[L.A. Reid]] and [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]] and achieved platinum status in the US. The album contained the Hot 100 hit singles "[[The Way You Love Me (Karyn White song)|The Way You Love Me]]", "[[Secret Rendezvous (song)|Secret Rendezvous]]", and "[[Superwoman (Karyn White song)|Superwoman]]" as well as the No. 1 R&B hit "[[Love Saw It]]", a duet with Babyface himself. White was nominated in the Best R&B/Urban Contemporary New Artist category for the [[1989 Soul Train Music Awards]], which was won by [[Al B. Sure]]. She also received nominations for two Grammy Awards. She became the first female artist to have the first three solo releases from their debut album hit No. 1 on the R&B charts.

Her follow-up album was ''[[Ritual of Love]]'' in 1991. It had songs produced by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] and featured the hit single "Romantic", which hit number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].  Other singles from the album include "The Way I Feel About You" (U.S. #12), "Walkin' the Dog", and "Do Unto Me" (the last two did not chart). The photographer and [[Music video director|director]] [[Matthew Rolston]] directed the video for the hit single "[[Romantic (song)|Romantic]]". Michael Walls, who was credited as [[Wardrobe stylist|stylist]] on ''Ritual of Love'', worked with White on the look for the ''Ritual of Love'' [[album sleeve]], and three of the music videos released for the album. Walls had the idea for the [[Chanel]]-inspired pearls and black dress used on the album cover, the [[French maid]] look and multiple wardrobe changes for video of "The Way I Feel About You", and the "Walkin' the Dog" video, which was based on a scene from the film ''[[Sweet Charity (film)|Sweet Charity]]''.

Her next album was ''[[Make Him Do Right]]'' in 1994. The album did not sell well, although she did chart with the singles "Hungah" and the [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]]-penned "Can I Stay With You", which became her final U.S. R&B Top 10 hit in early 1995. "I'd Rather Be Alone", her last chart single to date, peaked at No. 50 on the same chart later that year.
 
White left [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1999, and dropped out of the music public eye for many years to start a family.

In 2006, she recorded a new album, titled ''Sista Sista''; which was slated for release in 2006, but was shelved. Two tracks, "All I Do" and "Disconnected", were later released on the [[best of]] [[compilation album]], ''Superwoman: The Best of Karyn White''. She was also slated to appear on the [[Soul Train Music Awards]] in 2009 as a tribute to Babyface Edmonds. However, this performance was canceled when Edmonds and Reid withdrew from the Soul Train ceremony, declining the honor. In 2011, she was slated to have shot a pilot for a reality series with R&B singers [[Shanice]] and [[Debelah Morgan]].

White released her first album after a seventeen-year break, ''[[Carpe Diem (Karyn White album)|Carpe Diem]]'', in March 2012.<ref name="soultrain1">{{Cite web |url=http://soultrain.com/2012/01/31/the-return-of-karyn-white/ |title=The Return of Karyn White |publisher=Soul Train |access-date=April 29, 2012}}</ref> The album featured the singles "Sista, Sista" and "Unbreakable," both of which received music videos.
