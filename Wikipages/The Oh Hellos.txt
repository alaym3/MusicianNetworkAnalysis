== Musical style and influences ==
The Oh Hellos have a "Celtic-influenced style"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Grey|first=Stephanie|date=2016-09-28|title=The Oh Hellos on C.S. Lewis, Christian Art and Learning to Trust the Music Industry|url=https://www.westword.com/music/the-oh-hellos-on-cs-lewis-christian-art-and-learning-to-trust-the-music-industry-8335857|access-date=2021-03-28|website=Westword}}</ref> that has also been referred to as a “majestic” brand of folk-pop. Though they write all of their music themselves, Maggie and Tyler combine their voices with a string band and choir to complete their sound. Sometimes there are as many as 13 musicians on stage when they are performing.<ref name=":0" />

Maggie and Tyler have a very deep, introspective style. A defining characteristic of their music is the contrast between the soft melody and the intense lyrics, creating a sort of tension, as ''The Daily Times'' calls it. Many of their releases, such as ''Through the Deep, Dark Valley'' and ''Dear Wormwood'', could be considered concept albums as they tend to tell a story with concepts and themes running through it.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=stevew@thedailytimes.com|first=Steve Wildsmith|title=Siblings at the heart of The Oh Hellos turn tension into musical beauty|url=https://www.thedailytimes.com/entertainment/siblings-at-the-heart-of-the-oh-hellos-turn-tension-into-musical-beauty/article_35d79395-fc53-5f24-ac00-b2a74554563d.html|access-date=2021-03-26|website=The Daily Times|language=en}}</ref>
