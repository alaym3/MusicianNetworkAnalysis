==History==

===Name===
The band culled their name from the Variety Slanguage Dictionary, a glossary of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s frequently used [[slang]], which was provided by the Hollywood insider publication to help not-so-savvy readers decipher its content. The magazine used the term to refer to [[drive-in theatre]]s, because of their privacy and romantic allure for teenagers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=slanguage |title=Slanguage Dictionary |publisher=Variety.com |access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Agit>{{cite web |url=http://www.agitreader.com/features/passion_pit-02.23.html |title=Passion Pit: Pop Not Porno |work=The Agit Reader |access-date=December 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Donmoyer/Hultquist interview">{{cite web |title=An interview with Passion Pit's Nate Donmoyer and Ian Hultquist |publisher=[[The California Aggie]] |date=April 19, 2010 |url=http://theaggie.org/article/2010/04/19/an-interview-with-passion-pits-nate-donmoyer-and-ian-hultquist |access-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AuAerzQ7?url=http://www.theaggie.org/2010/04/19/an-interview-with-passion-pits-nate-donmoyer-and-ian-hultquist/ |archive-date=September 24, 2012 }}</ref>

===Formation===
The first Passion Pit songs, which would later become the ''[[Chunk of Change]]'' EP, were written by Angelakos at Emerson College as a belated Valentine's Day gift to his then-girlfriend. At first, he wrote and performed all his material alone using a laptop. After one of his solo shows in the Boston area, [[Ian Hultquist]], who was attending [[Berklee College of Music]] at the time, approached Angelakos and expressed interest in creating and playing music collaboratively.<ref name=Agit/> They formed a group that consisted of Angelakos, Hultquist, Ayad Al Adhamy, Thom Plasse (bass), and Adam Lavinsky (drums). The band spent a considerable amount of time trying to flesh out a collaborative format and structure that would work best for them. Jeff Apruzzese and [[Nate Donmoyer]] joined the band shortly after they signed to [[Frenchkiss Records|Frenchkiss]] in 2008, replacing Plasse and Lavinsky, respectively.<ref name="Donmoyer/Hultquist interview"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Kind of incredible |publisher=Southern Maryland Newspapers Online |date=September 4, 2009 |url=http://www.somdnews.com/stories/09042009/entecov173737_32178.shtml |access-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AuAfPzfM?url=http://ww2.somdnews.com/stories/09042009/entecov173737_32178.shtml |archive-date=September 24, 2012 }}</ref> In 2012, Adhamy was replaced by Xander Singh.

===2007–09: ''Chunk of Change''===
The band's debut EP, ''[[Chunk of Change]]'', was released on September 16, 2008.<ref name="Abstract">{{cite web |title=''Chunk of Change'' release date |publisher=Prefix Magazine |date=September 8, 2008 |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/passion-pit/chunk-of-change/21300/ |access-date=December 15, 2010}}</ref> The first four tracks were those that Angelakos had written as a gift for his girlfriend. The tracks quickly became popular throughout the [[Emerson College]] campus, where Angelakos was attending classes at the time, and had been passing out his own, self-produced copies. Two tracks, "[[Sleepyhead (song)|Sleepyhead]]" and "Better Things", were added for the commercial release of the EP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frenchkissrecords.com/bands/profile/passion_pit/ |title=Passion Pit |publisher=Frenchkiss Records |access-date=June 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006015926/http://frenchkissrecords.com/bands/profile/passion_pit/ |archive-date=October 6, 2011 }}</ref> The same year of their debut EP's release, the band was chosen as "Best New Local Act in 2008" in the [[WFNX (101.7 FM)|WFNX]]/''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|Boston Phoenix]]'' best music poll.<ref name="Abstract"/>

[[File:Passion Pit 2008-12-03.jpg|thumb|Passion Pit in 2008]]

The first and only single to be released from the EP, "Sleepyhead", received a good deal of exposure through its use in numerous media campaigns and advertisements, while the video for the song, directed by ''[[The Wilderness (company)|The Wilderness]]'', was included on [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'s Top 40 Music Videos of 2008 list.<ref name="Sleepyhead Video">{{cite web |title=Pitchfork Staff Lists: Top 40 Music Videos of 2008 |date=December 8, 2008 |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7565-top-40-music-videos-of-2008/3/ |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref> "Sleepyhead" was also used for the release trailer for the [[video game]] "[[LittleBigPlanet_2|Little Big Planet 2]]". The song contains samples of "Óró Mo Bháidín" by Irish singer and harpist [[Mary O'Hara]].<ref name="songfacts.com">{{cite web |title=Sleepyhead Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=15696 |access-date=December 4, 2010}}</ref>

Other songs from the EP received some exposure as well. "Cuddle Fuddle" was featured in [[E4 (channel)|E4]]'s second series of ''[[The Inbetweeners]]'' and "I've Got Your Number" was used in an advertisement for the cash card from [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]], [[O2 Money|Money in the UK]].

===2009–11: ''Manners''===
The band's first full-length studio album, ''[[Manners (album)|Manners]]'', was released on May 18, 2009, in the UK and May 19, 2009, in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/passionpitjams |title=Passion Pit |work=[[MySpace]] |access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref> In celebration, the band played their record release party on the 18th in New York City on a Rocks Off boat cruise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/393123/we-wanted-to-celebrate-in-a-different-way.jhtml#id=1611746 |title=Passion Pit's Boat Show: We Wanted To Celebrate In A Different Way |publisher=MTV |date=May 19, 2009 |access-date= June 30, 2010}}</ref> In a preview article, [[Clash (magazine)|ClashMusic.com]] commented that the album "has every chance to rank as one of the year's best" and that "it reveals additional nuances with each visit: a sure-fire sign of an album with true longevity".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/passion-pit-album-preview |title=Passion Pit Album Preview |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |first=Mike |last=Diver |date=March 26, 2009 |access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>

In order to obtain a specific background vocal accompaniment the band was looking for on ''Manners'', Passion Pit enlisted the help of the [[PS22 chorus]], who recorded vocals in-studio for three of the album's songs: "[[The Reeling]]", "[[Little Secrets (Passion Pit song)|Little Secrets]]", and "Let Your Love Grow Tall."<ref name="PS22 chorus">{{cite web |title=The PS22 Chorus Records Vocals for Columbia-signed Passion Pit's Full-length CD Debut! |date=January 18, 2009 |url=http://ps22chorus.blogspot.com/2009/01/ps22-chorus-records-vocals-for-passion.html |publisher=[[PS22 chorus]] |access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref> "The Reeling" was the first single to be released from the album and found success on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Songs]] chart in the fall of 2009, where it peaked at No. 34 in October<ref name="chart">{{cite web |title=Passion Pit Chart History
|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=passion pit|chart=Alternative Songs}} |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref> and "Little Secrets" was the third single to be released and had success on the chart as well, topping out at No. 39. "Let Your Love Grow Tall" was never released as a single but had some exposure being used in the [[All the World's a Stage (Ugly Betty)|sixteenth episode]] of the [[Ugly Betty (season 4)|fourth season]] of the TV series ''[[Ugly Betty]]''.

The album's second single, "To Kingdom Come", was used in the [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] commercial for its [[iPhone]] application.

"Sleepyhead" was the only track from ''Chunk of Change'' to be included on the album and was made available from iTunes for free as a discovery download in 2009. The song continued to receive additional exposure through its appearances in advertisements. It was used in a season 3 episode of the teen-drama, ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' and most recently in the debut trailer for [[LittleBigPlanet 2]],<ref name="GameTrailers.com">{{cite web |title=LittleBigPlanet2 trailer |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/debut-trailer-littlebigplanet-2/100038 |publisher=[[GameTrailers]] |access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref> which led to the band's increased popularity amongst fans and players of the game, who eventually created an in-game instrumental version of the song to listen to in the first game. When the sequel was released, it came with the song's actual instrumental version used in the trailer.

The song "Moth's Wings" was used in the fourth episode of the [[Gossip Girl (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The CW Television Network|CW]] teen drama ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' and in the closing credits of episode 36 of [[HBO]]'s ''[[Big Love]]''. It appeared in the ''[[FIFA 10]]'' video game and was included in the films ''[[Life As We Know It (film)|Life As We Know It]]'' and ''[[Wonder (film)|Wonder]]''. It has also been used as a background theme for [[Sky Sports]] coverage of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and as the music for a dance routine in Episode 5, Season 8, of the US television show ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (United States)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'', which received a standing ovation from the show's judges. It was also featured in two episodes of [[MTV]]'s show ''[[Awkward (TV series)|Awkward]]'' (the pilot and Season 3 finale, respectively).<ref>[http://www.fox.com/dance/recaps/season-8/episode-5 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903042326/http://www.fox.com/dance/recaps/season-8/episode-5 |date=September 3, 2011 }}</ref>

In June 2009, the band performed at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2009]] in [[Pilton, Somerset]], England, where they dedicated the final song of their set to festival headliner [[Jarvis Cocker]], who was to perform on the same stage later that same day.<ref name="PP blog">{{cite web |title=merry england |date=June 30, 2009 |url=http://www.passionpitmusic.com/blog/merry-england |publisher=Passion Pit |access-date=December 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715051744/http://www.passionpitmusic.com/blog/merry-england |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref> Afterwards, ''[[NME]]'', while favorably reviewing Passion Pit's performance, incorrectly reported the band as having dedicated their entire set to Cocker.<ref name="NME news">{{cite web |title=Passion Pit dedicate Glastonbury set to Jarvis Cocker |date=June 27, 2009 |url=https://www.nme.com/news/passion-pit/45678 |work=[[NME]] |access-date=December 28, 2010}}</ref>

On April 13, 2010, the band reissued ''Manners'' in a deluxe edition format which contained new artwork and three additional tracks: stripped-down versions of "Sleepyhead" and "Moth's Wings" and a cover of [[The Cranberries]]' song "[[Dreams (The Cranberries song)|Dreams]]".

=== 2017–2018: ''Tremendous Sea of Love'' ===
{{Main|Tremendous Sea of Love}}
During February and March 2017, several new Passion Pit songs were uploaded on YouTube on the account The Wishart Group (from the name of a project started by Michael Angelakos and dedicated to supporting musicians by providing them with legal, educational and healthcare services, with a focus on mental health, a topic on which Angelakos has been especially forthcoming), foreshadowing a fourth album for 2017. All of the videos for those new songs have the same background photo (a woman wearing a white dress, located in the middle of the sea, turning around as though she had sensed she was being secretly observed from behind), as does the front cover of the album.
