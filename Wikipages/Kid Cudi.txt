'''Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi''' (born January 30, 1984), better known by his stage name '''Kid Cudi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|d|i}} {{Respell|KUDD|ee}}; often stylized as '''KiD CuDi'''), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. He has widely been recognized as an influence on several contemporary [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Alternative hip hop|alternative]] acts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/kid-cudi-is-alright-profile/amp|title = Kid Cudi Has Seen the Light}}</ref><ref name="Tremr2015">{{cite web |url=https://www.tremr.com/charlie-wooley/kid-cudi-a-forgotten-founder-of-psychadelic-introspection-in-hip-hop |title=KiD CuDi - A Forgotten Influence on Psychedelic Introspection in Hip-Hop |first=Charlie |last=Wooley |date=July 6, 2015 |work=Tremr}}</ref><ref name=uproxx>{{cite web |url=https://uproxx.com/hiphop/kid-cudi-depression-legacy-mental-illness-hip-hop/ |title=Kid Cudi Is 'Reborn' After Defeating His Demons And Facing Depression |date=July 26, 2018 |website=UPROXX |access-date=March 30, 2019}}</ref> His music is often autobiographical, telling of his childhood hardships dealing with [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[loneliness]] and [[social alienation|alienation]], his struggle with alcohol and drugs into adulthood, as well as themes of [[Broken heart|heartbreak]], dissipation and celebration. Cudi began to gain major recognition following the release of his first official full-length project, a [[mixtape]] titled ''[[A Kid Named Cudi]]'' (2008), which caught the attention of American musician [[Kanye West]], who subsequently signed Cudi to his [[GOOD Music]] label imprint by late 2008.

In early 2008, Cudi had risen to prominence with the release of his commercial debut single "[[Day 'n' Nite]]", which became a worldwide hit. The song was later featured on Cudi's seminal debut studio album, ''[[Man on the Moon: The End of Day]]'' (2009), which was eventually certified [[Music recording sales certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=man+on+the+moon#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum |work=RIAA |access-date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> The album also included the singles "[[Make Her Say]]" and "[[Pursuit of Happiness (song)|Pursuit of Happiness]]", both of which achieved significant chart success. In 2010, Cudi released his second album ''[[Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager]]'', which features the singles "[[Erase Me (song)|Erase Me]]" and "[[Mr. Rager]]". Later that year he formed [[WZRD (band)|WZRD]], a [[rock band]], with his long-time collaborator [[Dot da Genius]]. Their [[WZRD (album)|eponymous debut album]] (2012) debuted at number one on the [[Rock Albums|''Billboard'' Top Rock Albums]] chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/kid-cudi-ditches-rap-for-rock_1178078 |title=Kid Cudi Ditches Rap For Rock |magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date=October 31, 2010 |access-date=April 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://keepittrill.com/online/2010/10/kid-cudi-forms-rock-band-called-wizard/ |title=Kid Cudi Forms New Rock Band Called 'Wizard' |first=Nadia |last=Trill |website=KeepitTrill.com |date=October 29, 2010 |access-date=April 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055425/http://keepittrill.com/online/2010/10/kid-cudi-forms-rock-band-called-wizard/ |archive-date=September 21, 2013}}</ref>

Cudi has since released the solo albums ''[[Indicud]]'' (2013), ''[[Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon]]'' (2014), ''[[Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven]]'' (2015), ''[[Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin']]'' (2016), and ''[[Man on the Moon III: The Chosen]]'' (2020). Cudi's joint album with Kanye West, under the [[Kids See Ghosts|eponymous name]] ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'' (2018), was met with widespread critical acclaim and was named among the best albums of 2018. In 2020, Cudi earned his first number-one song on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart with "[[The Scotts]]", a collaboration with Houston rapper [[Travis Scott]].

I broke down, I am to tears because I hate how life is so unfair. This has really touched my heart in a way I cant describe, this is why I do what I do.

In a January 2015 interview, at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], Kid Cudi expressed the possibility of releasing another album before the release of ''Man on the Moon III'': "I'm always making music. The beauty in that is that I have a lot of material. And I'm actually thinking that it would be good to release something in the meantime, before ''[[Man on the Moon III]]'' comes out. Another Kid Cudi album, it's just kind of along the lines of what I did with ''Indicud'' or ''Satellite Flight'', which is just its own standalone thing but still a Kid Cudi album. The ''Man on the Moon III'' album is something that's gonna take some time but I know the fans are gonna be patient and I really appreciate that guys, thank you for your patience.

''Man on the Moon III: The Chosen'', received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised Cudi's songwriting and generally favored the latter two acts, though some found it derivative of Cudi's earlier albums.

Artists can drop new music, chat with fans and host live shows from anywhere in the world.” Encore enables live music experiences through smart phones, fan interaction, community centered content and merchandise offerings to give fans new ways to reward the artists they love. “The energy from a concert is undeniable, both for the fans and artists. I am excited to launch Encore to help bring the live music experience back to our fans. Encore is committed to empowering both established and new artists and delivering the best mobile music experience out there,” Cudi says. Earlier in 2020, Encore closed a $2 million seed round led by global investment firm [[Battery Ventures]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicallyyours.com/kid-cudi-launches-mobile-app-encore-to-help-artists-monetize-their-connections-with-fans/|title=Encore Application|date=October 29, 2020|access-date=August 26, 2021}}</ref>

In his early career, Kid Cudi received criticism in the hip hop community for wearing [[skinny jeans]], before they became trendy after being worn by mainstream rappers, such as Lil Wayne and Kanye West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rapradar.com/2009/07/15/kid-cudi-defends-his-skinny-jeans/|title=Kid Cudi Defends His Skinny Jeans}}</ref> Cudi made headlines when he wore a [[kilt]] to a 2010 New Year's Eve party in [[Miami]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://hellobeautiful.com/759472/kid-cudi-hm-real-men-wear-skirts/ |title=Kid Cudi + H&M: "Real Men Wear Skirts" |website=HelloBeautiful.com |date=January 21, 2010 |access-date=March 21, 2020}}</ref> In April 2012, he made headlines again in a now-infamous moment when he gave ''[[TMZ]]'' paparazzi [[the finger]], claiming they have never "posted anything to make him look good".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2012/04/video-kid-cudi-stunts-on-tmz|title=Video: Kid Cudi Stunts on TMZ|website=[[Complex Networks]]}}</ref>

During his 2013 Cud Life concert tour, Cudi donned a custom made astronaut-esque suit that was designed by noted Hollywood costume designer Jose Hernandez. Officially dubbed the "Satellite Academy Space Suit", Joe La Puma of ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' explained, "It's more than just an interesting clothing choice; the suit represents a transition in his mind-state back to the highly anticipated ''Man on the Moon III''."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amp.www.complex.com/style/2013/09/kid-cudi-spacesuit-interview|title = Interview: Kid Cudi Breaks Down the Custom Spacesuit He's Wearing on the "Cud Life" Tour}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vladtv.com/article/175326/dumb-or-dope-kid-cudi-rocks-custom-space-suit-at-concert|title = Dumb or Dope?

In 2014, Cudi made headlines when he performed in a [[crop top]] at the annual [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1726160/kid-cudi-coachella-crop-top-hip-hop-fashion/|title = Will Kid Cudi's Coachella Crop Top Start a New Hip-Hop Fashion Trend?|website = [[MTV]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2014/04/twitter-reacts-kid-cudi-crop-top|title = Twitter Reacts to Kid Cudi's Crop Top at Coachella|website = [[Complex Networks]]}}</ref> In April 2021, he appeared as the sole musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he performed "Tequila Shots" and "[[Sad People]]". Both performances were in tribute to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s late frontman [[Kurt Cobain]], however it was his performance of "Sad People" that made headlines because Cudi wore a woman's dress as a statement against social norms much like his idol Cobain had done.<ref name=SNL/>

In September 2021, Cudi made headlines twice; first arriving at [[New York Fashion Week]] with electric blue hair, a Nirvana long-sleeve tee and a floor-length black skirt.<ref name=nyfwmg>{{cite web |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kid-cudi-hits-2021-met-gala-with-green-hair-louis-vuitton-skirt-and-a-massive-kaws-chain-news.139168.html |title=Kid Cudi Hits 2021 Met Gala With Green Hair, Louis Vuitton Skirt & Massive KAWS Chain |work=Hot New Hip Hop |last=McCloud |first=Taylor |date=September 14, 2021 |access-date=September 21, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> A few days later, Cudi showed up to the [[Met Gala]] wearing fluorescent green hair and dark eye makeup.

On the red carpet, Linnetz lifted Cudi’s veil. “Be yourself, be free, baby, yeah,” Cudi said into a microphone, with a grin; he’d paired the dress with a white tux jacket, crystal-covered sneakers, grungy eyeliner, an icy Black Jesus pendant, and Manic Panic-pink hair. The dress was another homage to Kurt Cobain.<ref>https://www.gq.com/story/kid-cudi-wedding-dress-cfda/amp</ref><ref>https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.65790/title.kid-cudi-channels-dennis-rodman-kurt-cobain-by-wearing-wedding-dress-be-free-baby</ref>

== Personal life ==
===Drug use===
In a January 2013 interview, Cudi revealed that he had stopped smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in 2011, both for the sake of his child and due to frustration with constantly being associated with the drug and [[Stoner culture#Cannabis subculture|stoner culture]].<ref name="DrugStop">{{cite magazine |url =http://www.complex.com/music/2013/01/kid-cudi-talks-quitting-weed-bossing-up-illuminati-rumors-and-motm-iii |title=Interview: Kid Cudi Talks Quitting Weed, Bossing Up, Illuminati Rumors, and "MOTM III" |first=Joe |last=La Puma |date=January 17, 2013 |access-date=August 2, 2013 |magazine=Complex}}</ref>

In a March 2013 interview, Cudi talked about how his initial sudden and unexpected fame drove him to alcohol and drugs:

{{cquote|For me, I just got to this point, and especially up until recently, I gave up liquor, I don't drink anymore, it's been five and a half months I've been sober. The booze was a new thing for me, I didn't realize I was an alcoholic all these years. I had a problem, I think with any addiction you have to be ready to make the choice, whether it's cigarettes or anything. You have to just commit and you just have to stick with it. I stopped everything [[cold turkey]]. When I had my cocaine problem I stopped cold turkey, I didn't go to rehab. I don't believe in these things. Some people need the extra help, not me. I wasn't a drug addict before this crap, I wasn't doing cocaine, I wasn't getting wasted every night because I didn't want to be alone. I wasn't this dark person before the madness, I was a whole other dude. I don't even think I smoked weed as much 'cause we couldn't afford it. You just have to make the choice and decide the person you wanna be and stick with it. You get to a certain age where the people around you are not gonna be on that rollercoaster all day long ready for you to go up, ready for you to go down, and stick with you through all the madness. People want you to be one person and stick with it and I chose to be clean and be sober and get my life together. For myself, for my health, for my daughter, for my family.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thefix.com/content/kid-cudi-reveals-how-he-beat-his-addictions |title=Kid Cudi Reveals How He Beat His Addictions |first=Bryan |last=Le |date=March 27, 2014 |work=The Fix}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.27973/title.kid-cudi-i-couldnt-deal-with-fame |title=Kid Cudi: "I Couldn't Deal With Fame" |first=Jay |last=Balfour |date=March 19, 2014 |work=HipHopDX}}</ref>}}

In a July 2016 interview, Kid Cudi revealed he suffered from [[survivor guilt]]: "I didn't like that I had money and success and I had made it.

These claims were disputed by Cudi and his attorney in a statement, which noted: "Cudi did not give up custody but reached an amicable agreement with the mother; that 'both parents are fit and proper persons to have custody of their child,' as stated in the final custody judgment; results came back negative for drugs in a drug test voluntarily taken by Cudi; and that the court acknowledged Cudi attempted to establish a relationship and visit his child since her birth and "voluntarily provided financial support, including child support, rent and other monthly payments, for his daughter since her birth until the time that a child support order was entered as part of the normal course of the case."
