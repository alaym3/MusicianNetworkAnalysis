==History==
===1992‚Äì1999: Early beginnings and breakthrough===
The group was formed in 1992 by [[RL (singer)|Robert "R.L." Huggar]] and brothers Raphael "Tweety" Brown and Terry "T-Low" Brown in Minneapolis, Minnesota after being introduced by the Brown's uncle, a gospel choir director. Originally, they were first known as ''Straight4ward'', and at one point managed by [[Sounds of Blackness]]' [[Ann Nesby]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/next-mn0000391177/biography|title=Next &#124; Biography & History|website=AllMusic}}</ref> However, after catching the attention of [[Naughty by Nature]]'s KayGee, he took the group to his [[Arista Records|Arista]] label Divine Mill, and began work on their debut album.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

They released their KayGee-produced debut single "Butta Love" in September 1997, which became a big R&B hit for the group peaking at No. 4 (and hitting the top 20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart). Soon after, their debut album, ''[[Rated Next]]'' was released on September 30, and sold moderately. It was followed in 1998 by the release of their biggest hit to date, "[[Too Close (Next song)|Too Close]]", which hit No. 1 on both the R&B and the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 charts. Sales of their debut album surged, helping the album peak at No. 13 R&B and No. 37 on the ''Billboard'' 200, eventually being certified double platinum, and earning them [[American Music Awards]], [[Billboard Awards|''Billboard'' Awards]] and [[Soul Train Awards]] nominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-n/next.htm|title=Next|publisher=Rock On The Net|access-date=2013-12-05}}</ref> A third single "I Still Love You" garnered the group another Top 5 R&B hit and a Top 20 on the Hot 100 charts.<ref name="VF"/>

===2000‚Äìpresent: Label changes and hiatus ===
In 2000, the group released the lead single "Wifey" ahead of their second album for Arista. The song became another No. 1 R&B hit for the group and also featured singer Lil' Mo on background vocals. Their second album, ''[[Welcome II Nextasy]]'', was released in June 2000 and was certified gold on the strength of the lead single. A second single "Beauty Queen" received moderate airplay, peaking at No. 48 on R&B and No. 59 on the Hot 100. After the album's cycle, the group took a break, leading RL to record and release his debut solo album ''RL:Ements'' for [[Clive Davis]]' then-new J Records label in 2002, which achieved moderate success with the singles "Got Me a Model" and "Good Man".{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}

The group also joined the J Records label, and released their third studio album ''[[The Next Episode (album)|The Next Episode]]'' in December of that same year. It featured the lead single "Imagine That" which peaked at No. 66 R&B and No. 91 on the Hot 100. Also, they collaborated with [[Jaheim]] on his single "Anything" off his debut album ''[[Ghetto Love (album)|Ghetto Love]]'' which earned the group another Top 10 R&B hit. After leaving the J Records label, they briefly aligned with [[50 Cent]]'s G-Unit and with Matthew Knowles' Music World labels, but did not release any music. The group later broke up due to internal conflicts and member T-Low suffering from a career-ending throat condition, but eventually reunited in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://singersroom.com/content/2011-06-04/rb-group-next-reunites-after-failed-label-deals-group-conflicts-illness/|title=R&B Group Next Reunite After Failed Label Deals, Group Conflicts & Illness|date=June 4, 2011}}</ref>

In 2014, the group began and completed work on a new album titled ''Next, Lies, & Videotape'' (originally titled ''Music 101'') but it was ultimately shelved.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Mitchell |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.10984/title.tuesday-rap-release-dates-drake-tha-dogg-pound-joell-ortiz |title=Tuesday Rap Release Dates: Drake, Tha Dogg Pound, Joell Ortiz &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2010-04-06 |access-date=2013-12-05}}</ref> In 2016, the group was featured on TV One's "Unsung" series which prompted another reunion for the group after a couple years of being distant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musictimes.com/articles/71218/20160612/r-b-group-next-squashes-beef-reunites-bring-more-great.htm|title=R&B Group Next Squashes Beef, Reunites to Bring More Great Music|first=Music|last=Times|date=June 12, 2016|website=Music Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheGroupNext_/status/741781608319975424|title=#NEXTISBACK #NOE @TheGroupNEXT_ @TweetfromNext @JustRL @TLowFromNext #BESTLIFEEVERpic.twitter.com/2QYqJXaKth|date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> In March 2018, the group premiered their new single "Want It" to UAC radio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaccess.com/login|title=Login to All Access &#124; Breaking Radio News and Free New Music &#124; AllAccess.com|website=All Access}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf-LWZaFRIZ/|title=Tweet From Next on Instagram: ‚ÄúThe day is finally here!!!
