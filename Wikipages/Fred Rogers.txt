'''Fred McFeely Rogers''' (March 20, 1928 – February 27, 2003), also known as '''Mister Rogers''', was an American television host, author, producer, and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Fred Rogers |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fred-Rogers |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=July 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719202319/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fred-Rogers |archive-date=July 19, 2020 |date=March 16, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> He was the creator, showrunner, and host of the preschool television series ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', which ran from 1968 to 2001.

Born in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania]], near [[Pittsburgh]], Rogers earned a bachelor's degree in music from [[Rollins College]] in 1951. He began his television career at [[NBC]] in New York, returning to Pittsburgh in 1953 to work for children's programming at NET (later [[PBS]]) television station [[WQED (TV)|WQED]]. He graduated from [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary]] with a bachelor's degree in divinity in 1962 and became a Presbyterian minister in 1963. He attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s Graduate School of Child Development, where he began his 30-year collaboration with child psychologist [[Margaret McFarland]]. He also helped develop the children's shows ''The Children's Corner'' (1955) for [[WQED (TV)|WQED]] in [[Pittsburgh]] and ''Misterogers'' (1963) in [[Canada]] for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. In 1968, he returned to Pittsburgh and adapted the format of his Canadian series to create ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'', which ran for 33 years. The program was critically acclaimed for focusing on children's emotional and physical concerns, such as death, sibling rivalry, school enrollment, and divorce.

Rogers died of stomach cancer on February 27, 2003, at age 74. His work in children's television has been widely lauded, and he received more than 40 honorary degrees and several awards, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2002 and a [[Lifetime Achievement Emmy]] in 1997. He was inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]] in 1999. Rogers influenced many writers and producers of children's television shows, and his broadcasts have served as a source of comfort during tragic events, even after his death.

Once this segment ends, Mr. Rogers leaves and returns to his home, indicating that it is time to visit the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Mr. Rogers proceeds to the window seat by the trolley track and sets up the action there as the Trolley comes out. The camera follows it down a tunnel in the back wall of the house as it enters the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. The stories and lessons told take place over a series of a week's worth of episodes and involve puppet and human characters. The end of the visit occurs when the Trolley returns to the same tunnel from which it emerged, reappearing in Mr. Rogers's home. He then talks to the viewers before concluding the episode. He often feeds his fish, cleans up any props he has used, and returns to the front room, where he sings the closing song while changing back into his dress shoes and jacket. He exits the front door as he ends the song, and the camera zooms out of his home and pans across the neighborhood model as the episode ends.{{refn|group=note|See Wolfe, pp. 9–16, for a complete description of the structure of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood''.}}

''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' emphasized young children's social and emotional needs, and unlike another PBS show, ''[[Sesame Street]]'', which premiered in 1969, did not focus on cognitive learning.<ref>King, p. 145.</ref> Writer Kathy Merlock Jackson said, "While both shows target the same preschool audience and prepare children for kindergarten, ''Sesame Street'' concentrates on school-readiness skills while ''Mister Rogers Neighborhood'' focuses on the child's developing psyche and feelings and sense of moral and ethical reasoning".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Kathy Merlock |editor1-last=Jackson |editor1-first=Kathy Merlock |editor2-last=Emmanuel |editor2-first=Steven M. |title=Revisiting Mister Rogers' Neighborhood: Essays on Lessons about Self and Community |publisher=McFarland & Company, Publishers |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=978-1-4766-2341-2 |page=11 |chapter=Social Activism for the Small Set |date=February 17, 2016}}</ref> The ''Neighborhood'' also spent fewer resources on research than ''Sesame Street'', but Rogers used early childhood education concepts taught by his mentor Margaret McFarland, [[Benjamin Spock]], [[Erik Erikson]], and [[T. Berry Brazelton]] in his lessons.<ref>King, p. 134.</ref> As the ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted, Rogers taught young children about civility, tolerance, sharing, and self-worth "in a reassuring tone and leisurely cadence".<ref name="postobit">{{cite news |last1=Estrada |first1=Louie |title=Children's TV Icon Fred Rogers Dies at 74 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/02/28/childrens-tv-icon-fred-rogers-dies-at-74/8f5b9796-3588-42cf-aa84-45daec1f0583/ |access-date=April 10, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=February 28, 2003}}</ref> He tackled difficult topics such as the death of a family pet, sibling rivalry, the addition of a newborn into a family, moving and enrolling in a new school, and divorce.<ref name="postobit" /> For example, he wrote a special segment that dealt with the [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]] that aired on June 7, 1968, days after the assassination occurred.<ref>King, p. 192.</ref>

According to King, the process of putting each episode of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' together was "painstaking"<ref>King, p. 184.</ref> and Rogers's contribution to the program was "astounding". Rogers wrote and edited all the episodes, played the piano and sang for most of the songs, wrote 200 songs and 13 operas, created all the characters (both puppet and human), played most of the major puppet roles, hosted every episode, and produced and approved every detail of the program.<ref>King, p. 204.</ref> The puppets created for the Neighborhood of Make-Believe "included an extraordinary variety of personalities".<ref>King, p. 216.</ref> They were simple puppets but "complex, complicated, and utterly honest beings".<ref>King, p. 219.</ref> In 1971, Rogers formed Family Communications, Inc.

In 1975, Rogers stopped producing ''Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' to focus on adult programming. Reruns of the ''Neighborhood'' continued to air on PBS.<ref>King, pp. 230–231.</ref> King reports that the decision caught many of his coworkers and supporters "off guard".<ref>King, p. 231.</ref> Rogers continued to confer with McFarland about child development and early childhood education, however.<ref>King, p. 240.</ref> In 1979, after an almost five-year hiatus, Rogers returned to producing the ''Neighborhood''; King calls the new version "stronger and more sophisticated than ever".<ref>King, p. 243.</ref> King writes that by the program's second run in the 1980s, it was "such a cultural touchstone that it had inspired numerous parodies",<ref name="king-266"/> most notably [[Eddie Murphy]]'s parody on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the early 1980s.<ref name="king-266"/>

Rogers retired from producing the ''Neighborhood'' in 2001 at age 73, although reruns continued to air. He and FCI had been making about two or three weeks of new programs per year for many years, "filling the rest of his time slots from a library of about 300 shows made since 1979".<ref name="finalday"/> The final original episode of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' aired on August 31, 2001.<ref>King, p. 338.</ref>

Rogers rarely spoke about his faith on air; he believed that teaching through example was as powerful as preaching. He said, "You don't need to speak overtly about religion in order to get a message across". According to writer Shea Tuttle, Rogers considered his faith a fundamental part of his personality and "called the space between the viewer and the television set 'holy ground'". But despite his strong faith, Rogers struggled with anger, conflict, and self-doubt, especially at the end of his life.<ref name="danielburke"/> He also studied [[Catholic mysticism]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and other faiths and cultures.<ref name="king-9"/><ref name="king-313">King (2018), p. 313.</ref> King called him "that unique television star with a real spiritual life",<ref name="king-313"/> emphasizing the values of patience, reflection, and "silence in a noisy world".<ref name="king-9"/> King reported that despite Rogers's family's wealth, he cared little about making money, and lived frugally, especially as he and his wife grew older.<ref>King (2018), p. 10.</ref><ref>King (2018), p. 336.</ref> King reported that Rogers's relationship with his young audience was important to him. For example, since hosting ''Misterogers'' in Canada, he answered every letter sent to him by hand. After ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' began airing in the U.S., the letters increased in volume and he hired staff member and producer Hedda Sharapan to answer them, but he read, edited, and signed each one.
