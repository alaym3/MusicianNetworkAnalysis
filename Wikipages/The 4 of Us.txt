'''The 4 of Us''' are a [[rock music|rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] from [[Newry]], [[County Down]], Northern Ireland.<ref name="4ofus1">(24 January 2003).

==History==
The 4 of Us released their first [[album]], ''Songs for the Tempted'' on [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] in 1989, with the [[single (music)|single]] "Mary", becoming one of the most played songs on Irish radio that year.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Consequently, the album went [[music recording sales certification|double platinum]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and won Best Album of the Year at the Irish Music Awards, defeating the internationally known act [[U2]].

The album ''Man Alive'' followed on [[Sony Records|Sony]]/[[Columbia Records]] in 1992, and saw the group enter the UK charts for the first time, with the album entering the chart at No. 64, and the single, "She Hits Me" spending four weeks on the chart peaking at No. 35.<ref name="shehits1">(13 March 1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0w8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60&dq=%224+of+Us%22&hl=en&ei=mlkxTt2QHoz2gAfb-djnDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%224%20of%20Us%22&f=false Hits of the UK], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' (listing "She Hits Me" debuting at #35 on UK chart)</ref>

The band then lost momentum, scrapping the release of ''Amplifier'', their proposed third album but released two singles, "Change (Amplifier Version)" and "Someone's Got to Lose" in 1997.

They did not separate however, and eventually returned to recording albums, releasing the largely acoustic-based ''Classified Personal'' on the FUTURE INC. label in 1999.<ref name="bill1-2003"/><ref name="reemerge07">(9 October 2007).

==2000s==
''Off the Record'', an album of re-recordings of the band's best known songs appeared on [[EMI]] in 2000 and included the previously unreleased songs "The Girl Next Door" and "She's So Real".
 
In 2003, the single "Sunlight", which would appear on the 2004 album ''Heaven and Earth'', began to receive [[airplay (radio)|airplay]] and was voted fourth in a poll to find the 'best Irish single ever', conducted by the national [[radio station]] [[Today FM]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}
  
In November 2006, the band released the album ''Fingerprints'' and followed this with a live album, ''Live at Vicar Street'' in 2009.

Throughout 2010/2011 via their Facebook page, the band previewed exclusive content, including previously unreleased tracks "The Way the River Flows" and "I Guess I Wasn't Made for These Times" which was made available as a free download single for a limited period.

On 21 October 2011, Brendan confirmed via ''[[Gerry Anderson (broadcaster)|The Gerry Anderson Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio Ulster]], that a brand new studio album is in progress and scheduled for release in 2012. He also mentioned the possibility of a 'Best Of...' compilation in the very near future.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Declan announced on 5 December 2011 via Facebook that the previously unavailable third album ''Amplifier'' would be released as a free download on the band's [https://web.archive.org/web/20110702003411/http://www.the4ofus.com/front official website].

On 14 August 2013, the first track "Seventy-Three" from the new album ''Sugar Island'' was premiered on the band's The4OfUsMurphyMusic YouTube channel. This was followed up on 10 September with "Hell to Pay".

On 25 March 2015, "Birds Eye View" was premiered before getting its mastered radio release on 8 April.

==Solo work==
In 2010, Brendan Murphy released his first solo album ''Walk with Me''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bze2jDB3bAI Live video + short interview]</ref> with brother Declan playing on several tracks. Via Brendan's Facebook, the non-album song "She Comes at Night" was made available as a limited free download single in May 2011 and, due to popular demand, again in November 2011.
Also via Brendan Murphy's Facebook page, two demos of "Shadow on the Sun" and "Raise the Dead Man", co-written with string arranger Kevin Malpass, were previewed.
