'''Red Velvet''' ({{Korean|hangul=레드벨벳|rr=Redeubelbet}}) is a South Korean [[girl group]] formed and managed by [[SM Entertainment]]. They originally debuted on August 1, 2014, with the single "[[Happiness (Red Velvet song)|Happiness]]" with the four-member line-up of [[Irene (singer)|Irene]], [[Seulgi (singer)|Seulgi]], [[Wendy (singer)|Wendy]] and [[Joy (singer)|Joy]]. A fifth member, [[Yeri (singer)|Yeri]], joined the group in March 2015, following the release of their first mini album, [[Ice Cream Cake (EP)|''Ice Cream Cake'']]. Musically, the work of Red Velvet reflects their own group name: their predominantly-[[Pop music|pop]] "red" side experiments occasionally with [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[funk]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], while their "velvet" side focuses on '90s-influenced [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] with elements of [[ballad]] and [[jazz]]. Their genre versatility and [[Hook (music)|hooks]] have garnered critical praise.

The group's Korean-language discography includes two studio albums, one reissue album, one compilation album, and ten extended plays—eleven of which have topped the South Korean [[Gaon Album Chart]]. Their hit singles "[[Red Flavor]]" and "[[Power Up (Red Velvet song)|Power Up]]" reached number one on the [[Gaon Digital Chart]]. Numerous others charted both in the Gaon Digital Chart and the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[World Digital Song Sales]] chart including "[[Happiness (Red Velvet song)|Happiness]]", "[[Ice Cream Cake (Red Velvet song)|Ice Cream Cake]]", "[[Dumb Dumb (Red Velvet song)|Dumb Dumb]]", "[[One of These Nights (Red Velvet song)|One of These Nights]]", "[[Russian Roulette (Red Velvet song)|Russian Roulette]]", "[[Rookie (Red Velvet song)|Rookie]]", "[[Peek-a-Boo (Red Velvet song)|Peek-a-Boo]]", "[[Bad Boy (Red Velvet song)|Bad Boy]]", "[[RBB (Really Bad Boy)]]", "[[Zimzalabim]]", "[[Umpah Umpah]]", "[[Psycho (Red Velvet song)|Psycho]]", and "[[Queendom (Red Velvet song)|Queendom]]". The group also ventured into the Japanese music scene with the extended plays ''[[Cookie Jar (EP)|#Cookie Jar]]'' (2018) and ''[[Sappy (EP)|Sappy]]'' (2019).

Red Velvet have received numerous [[List of awards and nominations received by Red Velvet|accolades]], most notably the [[Golden Disc Awards|Golden Disc]] New Artist Award, the [[Mnet Asian Music Awards|Mnet Asian Music Award]] for Best Female Group, the [[Korean Music Awards|Korean Music Award]] for Best Pop Song, and the [[Asia Artist Awards|Asia Artist Award]] for Song of the Year. <!-- "and by 2020 became the second K-pop group to ever win [[Daesang|Daesang (Grand Prize)]] for every release in a trilogy album (''[[The ReVe Festival: Day 1]]'', ''[[The ReVe Festival: Day 2|Day 2]]'', and ''[[The ReVe Festival: Finale|Finale]]''")" Please do not add this in! Stage of the Year & Music of the Year at 2019 and 2020 Soribada Best K-Music Awards were not awarded to "Zimzalabim" & "Psycho" but rather Red Velvet themselves. Music of the Year in 2020 Soribada Best K-Music Awards was also demoted off its Daesang status into a Daesang final nominee consolation prize. The information here therefore isn’t debatable, plus also having no legitimate source claiming a trilogy Daesang win that can be considered here.--> Their wide domestic influence has been recognized by ''[[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|Forbes]]'' [[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|Korea Power Celebrity]] (placing 11th in 2018 and fifth in 2019);<ref>{{Cite web|title=포브스코리아 선정 2019 파워 셀러브리티 40|url=http://jmagazine.joins.com/forbes/view/325767|date=April 23, 2019|access-date=August 12, 2020|website=Joongang Ilbo|language=ko|author=Oh Seung-il|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502123542/http://jmagazine.joins.com/forbes/view/325767|archive-date=May 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=[2018 대한민국 셀러브리티(8)] 한국 연예계의 세대교체|url=http://jmagazine.joins.com/forbes/view/320595|website=Joongang Ilbo|language=ko|author=Yang Mi-sun|date=March 23, 2018|access-date=August 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327212635/http://jmagazine.joins.com/forbes/view/320595|archive-date=March 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Internationally, they were named one of the most popular [[K-pop]] groups by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and are the fifth most streamed K-pop artist worldwide on [[Spotify]] as of February 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=From BTS to BLACKPINK, the Power of K-Pop Has No Bounds|url=https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-02-24/from-bts-to-blackpink-the-power-of-k-pop-has-no-bounds/|website=[[Spotify]]|date=February 24, 2020|access-date=August 29, 2021|archive-date=May 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505165046/https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-02-24/from-bts-to-blackpink-the-power-of-k-pop-has-no-bounds/|url-status=live}}</ref>
