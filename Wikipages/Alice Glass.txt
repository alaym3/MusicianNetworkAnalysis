Glass topped [[NME's Cool List|''NME''{{'}}s Cool List]] that year and responded to it by criticizing the idea of the cool list itself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Crystal Castles' Alice Glass reacts to topping 2008 Cool List |url=http://www.nme.com/news/crystal-castles/40824 |work=[[NME]] |date=4 November 2008 |access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref> The duo followed their debut album with two more critically acclaimed albums, ''[[Crystal Castles II|II]]'' (2010) and ''[[III (Crystal Castles album)|III]]'' (2012), completing a trilogy.

In the announcement, she noted that working within the band compromised her efforts towards "sincerity, honesty, and empathy for others".<ref>{{cite web |title=Crystal Castles announce their split on Twitter |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/22102/1/crystal-castles-announce-their-split-on-twitter |website=Dazed |access-date=10 November 2015}}</ref> She later had a number of public disagreements with her former bandmate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alice Glass Responds To Ethan Kath's "Manipulative" Statements About Crystal Castles |url=http://www.stereogum.com/1795321/alice-glass-responds-to-ethan-kaths-manipulative-statements-about-crystal-castles/wheres-the-beef |work=Stereogum|access-date=10 November 2015}}</ref>

In October 2017, Glass posted a statement on her official website explaining her departure from Crystal Castles, accusing co-founder [[Ethan Kath]] of sexual, physical, and mental abuse. The accusations detail the abuse starting when Glass was 15 and began recording with Kath and escalated until her eventual departure from Crystal Castles. Kath responded the same day in a statement issued to ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' through his attorney, where he called the accusations "pure fiction" and said he was consulting with his lawyers as to his legal options.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/alice-glass-accuses-crystal-castles-co-founder-ethan-kath-of-rape-and-assault |title=Alice Glass Accuses Crystal Castles Co-Founder Ethan Kath of Rape and Assault; Kath Responds |work=Pitchfork |last=Strauss |first=Matthew |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref> The following month, Kath sued Glass for defamation, but was dismissed in February 2018.<ref>
