'''Guster''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States. Founding members [[Adam Gardner]], [[Ryan Miller (musician)|Ryan Miller]], and [[Brian Rosenworcel]] began practice sessions while attending [[Tufts University]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts]], and formed the band in 1991. The members met during the freshman Wilderness Orientation program in August of that year, playing publicly together as a trio two months later at the Midnight Cafe coffee house set in the common area of the Lewis Hall dormitory. While attending Tufts, the band lived at 139 College Avenue in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2011/08/15/guster_mixes_songcraft_and_humor_at_bank_of_america_pavilion_friday_night/|title=Guster mixes songcraft and humor at Bank of America Pavilion Friday night|work=Boston.com|date=August 15, 2011|access-date=October 29, 2014|last1=Rodman|first1=Sarah}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2003/09/16/guster_breezes_home_with_a_newfound_range/|title=Boston.com / A&E / Music / Guster breezes home with a newfound range|publisher=Boston.com|access-date=October 29, 2014}}</ref>

The band stayed "[[Underground music|underground]]" for its first two full-length albums, ''[[Parachute (Guster album)|Parachute]]'' (1994) and ''[[Goldfly (album)|Goldfly]]'' (1997), but broke into the musical mainstream in 1999 with its third studio album ''[[Lost and Gone Forever]]'', featuring the single "[[Fa Fa]]", which made it onto the [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks|Adult Top 40]]. The band enjoyed moderate success on the charts with ''[[Keep It Together (album)|Keep It Together]]'', its fourth album, with two singles in the [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks|Adult Top 40]] ("[[Careful (Guster song)|Careful]]" and "[[Amsterdam (Guster song)|Amsterdam]]"). [[Joe Pisapia]] joined the official lineup for ''Keep It Together'' and its follow-up, ''[[Ganging Up on the Sun]]'', which peaked at 25 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. A variety of television shows and movies have featured the band's music, including ''[[Martian Child]]'', which featured their song "[[Satellite (Guster song)|Satellite]]"; ''[[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]''; ''[[Wedding Crashers]]''; ''[[Life as a House]]'', which makes several allusions to the band throughout the film; ''[[The O.C.]]''; and one of the band's songs was used in an ad for [[Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VArUMW6rlfI&feature=player_embedded|title=TWC 2005 Bringing Weather to Life campaign|work=YouTube|access-date=October 29, 2014}}</ref> The band earned its first gold record in 2018 for its single "[[Satellite (Guster song)|Satellite]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=guster#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum|work=RIAA|access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref>

Guster's tours were originally local, but began to spread as the band gained popularity. In 1999, Guster gave its first performance in [[Canada]], followed by a 2004 tour in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that had four shows in [[London]] and one in [[Manchester]].<ref>[http://www.guster.com/archives/setlists.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826110651/http://www.guster.com/archives/setlists.html|date=August 26, 2007}}</ref> Guster maintains a liberal [[Taper (concert)|taping policy]] and has a very dedicated and active taping community. Despite this policy, the band has released several live shows via [[iTunes]].

==History==
The band members met during freshman orientation at [[Tufts University]] in 1991. A year later, after writing a few songs in their dorm rooms, the band named itself Gus and booked its first gig. The band recorded its first album independently in 1994, titled ''[[Parachute (Guster album)|Parachute]]''. This album established the band as a favorite of the same 1990s scene that became popular through bands such as the [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[The Disco Biscuits]], [[moe.]], [[Phish]], and [[Widespread Panic]]. The band was still in college when it recorded the album. Shortly after the release of ''Parachute'', another artist calling himself Gus signed a deal with a major record company, forcing the band to rename itself Guster.

In 1996, Guster independently recorded their second album, ''[[Goldfly (album)|Goldfly]]'', releasing it early the next year. In 1998 the band signed with [[Sire Records]] and re-released ''Goldfly''. A year later, the band released the album ''[[Lost and Gone Forever]]'', produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]]. With the backing of a major label, the band appeared on shows such as the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and it released their first music video for their song "[[Fa Fa]]". The band also appeared at [[Woodstock '99]], and performed at the 1999 Stardust Picnic festival at Historic Fort York, Toronto.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000204135613/http://chartattack.com/road/reviews/1999/19990721-stardust.html "Live Reviews: The Stardust Picnic"]. ''Chart Attack'', July 11, 1999, Howard Druckman</ref>

Guster released its fourth album, ''[[Keep It Together (album)|Keep It Together]]'', in 2003, with the first single, "[[Amsterdam (Guster song)|Amsterdam]]", getting significant airplay<ref>{{cite web|title=Guster Sets Off For Headlining Tour|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69286/guster-sets-off-for-headlining-tour|magazine=Billboard|access-date=July 26, 2010}}</ref> on the radio. Following the release of ''Keep it Together'', multi-instrumentalist Joe Pisapia, who had been touring with the band, became a full-time member. A live album/DVD, ''[[Guster on Ice]]'', compiled from two shows in [[Portland, Maine]], in December 2003, was released in 2004. Guster released its fifth full-length studio album, ''[[Ganging Up on the Sun]]'', on June 20, 2006. The single "[[Manifest Destiny/Sorority Tears]]" was released in November 2005 on the Internet. On September 27, 2006, Guster won Album of the Year (Major) at the [[Boston Music Awards]]. Alongside ''Ganging Up on the Sun'', the band released on its website a documentary comedy series called ''Joe's Place''. The band also participated in the [[Barenaked Ladies]]' Ships and Dip cruise. In 2009, Guster took part in a similar event with musician [[John Mayer]] called Mayercraft Carrier 2 aboard the [[Carnival Splendor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.jamradio.org/825-john-mayer-cruise-mayercraft-carrier.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090123043304/http://news.jamradio.org/825-john-mayer-cruise-mayercraft-carrier.php |archive-date=January 23, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2016, en route to play a show in [[Philadelphia]], the group was stopped in [[Pittsburgh]] due to the [[January 2016 United States blizzard]].

==Style==
Guster is often recognized for its choice of instruments during their earlier years: two members playing [[Guitar|acoustic guitars]] and one member playing various [[percussion instruments]]. Brian Rosenworcel, the band's percussionist (affectionately dubbed the Thundergod by fans), added to Guster's unique sound with a combination of [[Bongo drum|bongos]], [[cymbal]]s, and other drums, playing live shows using only his bare hands. While Miller played rhythm parts, Gardner would often play a bass line on his guitar. Guster's sound is recognized for its vocal harmonies, with both Miller and Gardner singing lead vocals on different songs; in songs such as "What You Wish For" and "Happier", the two members sing different lyrics simultaneously. While Guster's studio albums included more instrumental variety (e.g. [[violin]], [[bass guitar|bass]], [[drum kit]]), its live shows generally retained the same lineup until tours supporting its album ''Lost and Gone Forever,'' in which the band diversified by playing different instruments on some songs. At this time, Rosenworcel began introducing a more traditional drum kit into the stage and studio performances in an effort to move away from bare-hand percussion.

Guster's live shows have a style of their own. For encores, the band has sometimes featured drummer Brian Rosenworcel moving to the front microphone and singing humorous covers. These have ranged from [[Temple of the Dog]]'s "[[Hunger Strike (song)|Hunger Strike]]" to [[4 Non Blondes]]' "[[What's Up? (4 Non Blondes song)|What's Up?]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVktuh-4oeQ&feature=channel_page|title=Guster - What's Up - 4 Non Blondes cover @ Loyola 4/29/07|work=YouTube|access-date=October 29, 2014}}</ref> to the theme song from the TV show ''[[Cheers]]'' ("[[Where Everybody Knows Your Name]]").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeTu_ytKTwA|title=Guster - Cheers theme song|work=YouTube|access-date=October 29, 2014}}</ref> Other examples include: "[[Under the Bridge]]" by the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]],  "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]" by [[Bonnie Tyler]], "[[In the Air Tonight]]" by [[Phil Collins]], and "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]" by [[Katy Perry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gusterroadjournal.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/baby-im-a-firework/|title=Baby, I'm a Firework - Guster Road Journal|work=Guster Road Journal|date=July 5, 2013|access-date=October 29, 2014}}</ref> Other traditions at live shows have been developed over the years. For example, at the end of "Airport Song", people in the crowd throw [[Table tennis|ping-pong]] balls at the stage, in reference to the studio recording where the audio of a table tennis game can be heard in the background.

The band's humor is noted by many fans. For laughs, the three original members of Guster opened a number of their own shows as the Peace Soldiers, three [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]]-looking musicians. With the addition of Joe into the band, it has since opened for itself in costume as a jam band called Trippin' Balls. During a 2001 show (which was oddly enough opened by Joe Pisapia's band Joe, Marc's Brother) in [[Rochester, New York]], the band started their show with an empty stage. The music to ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' played over the sound system, and a voice called each of the band members down from where they had hid themselves in the audience. Upon hearing their name, each member played the part of an enthusiastic game show contestant all the way to the stage. During a show in 2002 when Guster played with [[John Mayer]] and [[John Butler Trio]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the band danced around on stage with [[KFC]] buckets covering their heads while J.B.T. was playing their set. In 2019, during their third annual On the Ocean festival in [[Portland, Maine]], the band advertised a free afterparty "headlined by the legendary EDM group, PIPPI". During the afterparty, PIPPI was revealed to be the band dressed in matching jumpers with [[Pippi Longstocking]] style wigs.

==Fan reception==

Guster maintains a close relationship with its fans with regular studio updates and road journals on their web site, guster.com, and signs autographs after shows. Guster once maintained a rep (representative) program, through which fans received promotional materials for upcoming concerts and albums to sell. Reps were rewarded with a special, rep-only series of EP's called ''The Pasty Tapes'' as well as invitations to rep-only concerts. Following the release of ''Ganging Up on the Sun'', the band formed a new program called the Wrecking Machines, through which fans are able to receive posters for advertising nearby concerts. Guster is a constantly touring band, at times playing up to 250 shows a year. Kesha was an early fan communicated with the band via email.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/guster_the_pains_of_being_pop_at_heart/|title=Guster: The Pains of Being Pop at Heart|date=April 2, 2015|website=Relix.com|access-date=November 23, 2020}}</ref>

==Activism==
In 2004, Guster guitarist and vocalist Adam Gardner and his wife co-founded [[Reverb (non-profit)|Reverb]], an organization dedicated to assisting touring artists by making activities more environmentally sound. It operates from within the music industry as well as the environmental world. Reverb greens artists’ tours and the music business at large while raising awareness and support for the environment through an interactive eco-village. Since its inception, Reverb has worked with (among others) [[Billie Eilish]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[Barenaked Ladies]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[John Mayer]], [[Dave Matthews Band]], and Guster. In July 2006, Gardner was among those interviewed about Reverb by ''The Green Room'' magazine, which would later interview Gardner alone in coverage of a Guster show. ''[[Newsweek]]'' did a similar profile in its April 16, 2007, issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17996838/site/newsweek/|title=Newsweek - National News, World News, Health, Technology, Entertainment and more... &#124; Newsweek.com|date=May 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516201635/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17996838/site/newsweek/|access-date=November 23, 2020|archive-date=May 16, 2008}}</ref>

In 2006, Guster named its spring tour the Campus Consciousness Tour. The band toured with [[The Format]], and it powered its buses and trucks with [[biodiesel]] and aimed to use the tour to teach audiences about the environment. Participation in the early 2007 IZStyle Winter Tour had similar goals. In fall 2007, Guster headlined the Crocs' Next Step Campus Tour with [[Brett Dennen]] as a supporting act. The tour promoted eco-friendly green initiatives while educating attendees on ways to help the environment. The tour stopped at fifteen colleges.
