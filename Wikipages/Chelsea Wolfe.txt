Of her childhood, Wolfe said, "I grew up pretty fast. I had older sisters. By the time I was 11, I was drinking [[Malt liquor|40s]]."<ref name="Revolver"/> She also struggled with [[sleep paralysis]] as a child and through her teens, which landed her in the hospital for [[sleep studies]]; these experiences eventually became material for her albums ''[[Abyss (Chelsea Wolfe album)|Abyss]]'' and ''[[Hiss Spun]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matadorreview.com/chelsea-wolfe/|title=Chelsea Wolfe|website=Matador Review|access-date=February 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://submergemag.com/music/chelsea-wolfe-2017/|title=Thundering Haze • Chelsea Wolfe Parts the Veil on Sixth Studio Album, Hiss Spun|work=Submerge Magazine|access-date=February 19, 2018}}</ref>

==Career==

=== 2006: ''Mistake in Parting'' ===
In 2006 Wolfe composed an album, titled ''Mistake in Parting'', which was never officially released.<ref name=prefix>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/features/chelsea-wolfe/chelsea-wolfe-on-las-strange-darkness-and-her-dark/68922/|work=Prefix Mag|title=Chelsea Wolfe on LA's Strange Darkness And Her Dark, Deep Secret|author=Bugbee, Tim|date=October 8, 2012|access-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref> Of the album, Wolfe said: "I was 21 years old and wrote a shitty singer-songwriter breakup album. I didn't even really want to be a musician back then, but a lot of my friends were like 'let's do this, I've got some producer friends' and they helped me make this over-produced, terrible record... I sort of took a break from music for a while since I wasn't happy with what I was making".<ref name="prefix"/> Wolfe later commented that she scrapped the album largely because it had been written about events in her personal life: "I was writing really personal stuff about my own life, and I didn't feel comfortable at all... I didn't want [my music] to be so much about myself, and I just had to find a new perspective".<ref>{{cite interview|interviewer=iDS Imagem do Som|last=Wolfe|first=Chelsea|date=November 4, 2014|location=Portugal|title=Entrevista Chelsea Wolfe}} {{Youtube|Lu7gABtbvMQ}}.</ref>

She composed her first two albums on her mother's classical guitar, which was missing a tuning peg; as a result, the strings had to be tuned down, which was a stylistic element carried on to the studio recordings.<ref name="qa" />

==Musical style and influences==
[[File:Chelsea Wolfe by Jeremy Perez 2012-06-03.png|thumb|upright|Wolfe performing live, 2012]]
Wolfe has mentioned an array of artists and genres as influences, including [[black metal]] and [[Nordic folk music|Scandinavian folk music]], but has said: "I do have a hard time sticking to one genre, and honestly I prefer it that way.
