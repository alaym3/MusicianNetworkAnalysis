'''Kittie''' is a Canadian [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[London, Ontario]] in 1996. All of their material has been released through [[independent record label]]s, which to date includes six studio albums, one video album, four [[extended plays]], thirteen singles, and thirteen music videos. "Kittie" was chosen as the band name because the name "seemed contradictory."<ref name="SPIN">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXGw14ml_M4C&q=talena+atfield+financial&pg=PA26 |title=Underage Against the Machine |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |pages=25–26 |first=James |last=Hannaham |volume=18 |number=1 |issn=0886-3032 |date=January 2002 |access-date=September 1, 2015}}</ref>

Kittie formed in 1996 when [[Fallon Bowman]] and Mercedes Lander met in gym class. Morgan Lander became the lead vocalist and one of Kittie's guitarists and Tanya Candler completed the band's lineup on bass. After signing to NG Records, Kittie released their debut album ''[[Spit (album)|Spit]]'', which was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and sold at least 600,000 copies in the United States. The band released ''[[Oracle (Kittie album)|Oracle]]'' in 2001 and ''[[Until the End (album)|Until the End]]'' in 2004. In 2005, Kittie parted ways with Artemis Records and created their own label. The band released ''[[Funeral for Yesterday]]'' in 2007 and signed to [[E1 Music]] in 2009. The band released ''[[In the Black]]'' in 2009 and ''[[I've Failed You]]'' in 2011. In 2014, a documentary, ''Kittie: Origins/Evolutions'', chronicling the history of the band was released in co-ordination with its 20th anniversary.

Kittie has been categorized under multiple [[heavy metal subgenres]], including [[death metal]], [[nu metal]], and [[alternative metal]].

She acknowledged a change in influence from their early days, stating, "Then we listened to bands like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Silverchair]], and [[Alice in Chains]]. Now we listen to stuff like [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Nile (band)|Nile]]." However, the band would continue to write in the same fashion by first composing the music and then using that "as the backdrop behind the vocals."<ref name=SnoCore>Joseph, Peter [https://archive.today/20120712002040/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2001/02/08/Arts/SnoCore.Ball.Hits.With.Metal.Edge-27310.shtml Sno-core Ball hits with metal edge] 'The GW Hatchet'' (February 8, 2001).

===''Funeral for Yesterday'' (2005–2007)===
Until March 2005, Kittie were signed to Artemis Records but parted ways with the label due to "a proposed amendment to the recording budget for the pending fourth Kittie album." Problems between the group and record label had been long speculated. In March 2004, Artemis and Kittie came to an out of court settlement over unpaid royalties and eleven breaches of contract by Artemis.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1443409/kittie-artemis-settle-differences |title=Kittie, Artemis Settle Differences |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=April 21, 2020 |archive-date=February 14, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214101736/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1443409/kittie-artemis-settle-differences |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As with Talena Atfield's departure from the band, unjustified rumours about financial reasons were cited;{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and in the case of Jennifer Arroyo, the desire to work outside of Kittie full-time was an additional factor. Jennifer Arroyo would go on to join [[Billy Graziadei]] of [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] to form [[Suicide City]].<ref name="AM"/>

In 2005, Kittie added two new members: Tara McLeod on guitar and Trish Doan on bass. In 2005, Morgan and Mercedes Lander's clothing line, Poisoned Black clothing, started.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kittie-s-morgan-and-mercedes-launch-clothing-line/ |title=Kittie's Morgan and Mercedes Launch Clothing Line |work=[[Blabbermouth]]}} ''September 26, 2005''</ref> Morgan and Mercedes also appeared briefly in the documentaries ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]'' and ''Heavy Metal - Louder than Life''. On February 7, 2006, Kittie released their ''Never Again'' EP through [[Rock Ridge Music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=4572 |title=Kittie Confirms More Never Again Tour Dates |publisher=[[KNAC]]}} ''May 3, 2006''</ref> Also in 2006, vocalist Morgan Lander provided vocals on the song "It Turns to Rust", from the album ''[[In the Arms of Devastation]]'', by the Canadian [[death metal]] band [[Kataklysm]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/reviews/details.cfm?releaseid=405 |title=Kataklysm - "In the Arms of Devastation" |publisher=Metal Underground}}</ref>

Kittie created their own record label, Kiss of Infamy Records, and used it to release their fourth studio album. The label name was later changed to "X of Infamy" after a cease-and-desist letter from attorneys representing Kiss Catalog Ltd. (the owner of the intellectual property rights pertaining to the musical group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]) alleging that the Kiss of Infamy trademark was "confusingly similar" to their client's trademark.<ref name=Label>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-attorneys-force-kittie-to-change-name-of-record-label/ |title=Kiss Attornerys Force Kittie To Change Name of Record Label |work=[[Blabbermouth]]}} ''December 1, 2006''</ref> Kittie's fourth studio album ''[[Funeral for Yesterday]]'' was released on February 20, 2007 through their record label.<ref name=Label/> Along with the release of ''Funeral for Yesterday'', Morgan Lander announced that Kittie would release a 45-minute-DVD with the CD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercedeslander.net/ |title=www.mercedeslander.net |publisher=www.mercedeslander.net |access-date=April 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402111023/http://www.mercedeslander.net/ |archive-date=April 2, 2009 }}</ref> In February 2007, Kittie toured as part of the ''Funeral for Yesterday Tour'' alongside [[Walls of Jericho (band)|Walls of Jericho]], [[36 Crazyfists]], [[Dead To Fall]], and [[In This Moment]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kittie-trailer-for-funeral-for-yesterday-companion-dvd-available/|title=KITTIE: Trailer For 'Funeral For Yesterday' Companion DVD Available|date=December 13, 2006|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=November 4, 2019}}</ref>
