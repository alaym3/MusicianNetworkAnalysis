Bolton originally performed in the [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genres from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, both on his early solo albums and those he recorded as the frontman of the band [[Blackjack (American band)|Blackjack]]. He became better known for his series of [[pop rock]] [[ballad]]s, recorded after a stylistic change in the late 1980s.

Bolton's achievements include selling more than 75 million records, recording eight top 10 albums and two number-one singles on the ''Billboard'' charts, as well as winning six [[American Music Awards]] and two [[Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.twcc.com/articles/2014/06/06/t/time-warp-turntable-jams-music-n-mullets.6|title=Time Warp Turntable Jams: Music 'N' Mullets|last=Reporter|first=TWC|publisher=[[Time Warner Cable]]|date=June 6, 2014|access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://lancasteronline.com/entertainment/michael-bolton-may-not-be-hip-but-he-s-happening/article_5d16f32d-8230-58e9-941c-8c8d684fd9a8.html|title=Michael Bolton may not be hip, but he's happening|last=Ferguson|first=Jon|publisher=[[Lancaster Newspapers, Inc.]]|date=February 21, 2013|access-date=23 May 2014}}</ref>

==Career==

===Music===
Bolton began recording in 1975 at [[The Church Studio]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. This first album was self-titled using his original family name of Bolotin. Early in his musical career he focused on [[hard rock]], with his band [[Blackjack (American band)|Blackjack]] once opening for [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] artist [[Ozzy Osbourne]] on tour. It was rumored that in 1983 Bolton auditioned for, but was denied, the lead vocalist position with Osbourne's former band, [[Black Sabbath]].<ref name="iommiautobiography">{{cite book |last=Iommi |first=Tony |title=Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath |url=https://archive.org/details/ironmanmyjourney00iomm_0 |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0306819551}}</ref> Bolton later stated this was untrue, saying "That rumor about me auditioning for Black Sabbath was only a rumor, I don't know how on earth it started."<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/30-fascinating-early-bands-of-future-music-legends-200891/michael-boltons-hard-rocking-hair-band-black-jack-201049/|title=30 Fascinating Early Bands of Future Music Legends|last=Runtagh|first=Jordan|date=January 22, 2018|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=September 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name="buckley">{{cite web|url=https://www.echo-news.co.uk/leisure/music/10986013.Let_me_put_that_rumour_to_bed___I_never_auditioned_for_Black_Sabbath__Power_ballad_supremo_Michael_Bolton_on_touring_with_Ozzy/|title=Let me put that rumour to bed...I never auditioned for Black Sabbath: Power ballad supremo Michael Bolton on touring with Ozzy|last=Buckley|first=Kelly|date=February 6, 2014|work=[[The Echo (Essex)|The Echo]]|access-date=September 14, 2018}}</ref>

After [[anglicizing]] his family name to Bolton, he gained his first major hit as a songwriter, co-writing "[[How Am I Supposed to Live Without You]]" for [[Laura Branigan]], previously best known for singing the pop hit "[[Gloria (Laura Branigan song)|Gloria]]". Narrowly missing the Top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US pop chart]], Branigan took the song to number one on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary chart]] for three weeks in 1983. The two sought to work with each other again, and their next collaboration was when Bolton co-wrote "[[I Found Someone]]" for Branigan in 1985. Her version was only a minor hit, but two years later, [[Cher]] resurrected the song, and with it her own singing career. Bolton co-wrote several other songs for both singers. Bolton recorded his own rendition of "How Am I Supposed to Live Without You" in 1988, which reached number one on the Hot 100.

Bolton achieved his greatest success in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a singer on the adult contemporary/[[easy listening]] charts. One of his first major hits was his 1987 interpretation of the [[Otis Redding]] classic "[[(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay]]". Redding's widow, Zelma Redding, said she was so moved by Bolton's performance "that it brought tears to my eyes. It reminded me so much of my husband that I know if he heard it, he would feel the same."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7sDAAAAMBAJ&q=The+Dock+of+the+Bay+bolton+zelma+redding&pg=PA64|title=People Are Talking About . . .|date=January 18, 1988|magazine=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|access-date=September 19, 2015}}</ref> Always interested in [[soul music|soul]] and [[Motown]] classics, Bolton's success with that song encouraged him to tackle the standard "[[Georgia on My Mind]]", with which he had another hit. In 1991, Bolton released the album ''[[Time, Love & Tenderness]]'' which featured his [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[cover version]] of "[[When a Man Loves a Woman (song)|When a Man Loves a Woman]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-b/michaelbolton_main.htm |title=Michael Bolton |publisher=Rock on the Net |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>

As a singer, he has performed with other artists such as: [[Lucia Aliberti]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[José Carreras]], [[Tony Cetinski]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Renée Fleming]], [[Wynonna Judd]], [[BB King]], [[The Lonely Island]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Percy Sledge]], and [[Zucchero]]. As a songwriter, he has written and collaborated on several songs for other artists as well.

Bolton's last Top 40 single in the US in his own right was the 1997 hit "[[Go the Distance]]" (featured in the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated motion picture ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''), which peaked at No. 1 on the US adult contemporary chart. He hired conductor Larry Baird (orchestral musical director/conductor/arranger for [[The Moody Blues]], [[Three Dog Night]], [[Al Jarreau]], etc.) for his 2001 tour.

In 2006, Bolton and [[Nicollette Sheridan]] (his fiancée at the time) sang a duet, "The Second Time Around", for the album ''[[Bolton Swings Sinatra]]''. In March 2007, Bolton toured South Africa for the first time. He was the headline act at [[Jacaranda 94.2]] FM's two-day concert.

For ''[[Over the Rainbow (2007 album)|Over the Rainbow]]'', an album which was recorded in five days, Bolton recorded the song "[[Theme from New York City|New York City]]", which was also on his ''Bolton Swings [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]]'' album. This was for an episode of the TV series, ''[[Challenge Anneka]]''. The proceeds from the album went to children's [[hospice]]s across the UK.

Bolton performed a duet entitled "Il Mio Amico" with the Italian singer [[Anna Tatangelo]] at the [[Sanremo Music Festival]] 2008. The song was originally sung by Tatangelo alone, but the duet version contained English lyrics as well.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Bolton's album ''[[Only a Woman Like You]]'' was released in 2001. The title song was co-written by [[Shania Twain]]. Bolton released his album ''[[One World One Love]]'' in the UK on September 21, 2009. The first single, "Just One Love", was released one week earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelbolton.com |title=Michael Bolton |publisher=Michael Bolton |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Michael Bolton-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Bolton in [[Barcelona]], Spain, January 2010]]
In 2011, Bolton was featured as a guest vocalist in [[The Lonely Island]]'s song "[[Jack Sparrow (song)|Jack Sparrow]]" on their ''[[Turtleneck & Chain]]'' album. His performance with the comedic hip-hop trio focused on his (intentionally) off-topic chorus and miscommunication with the group, and the video featured him dressed in costumes as [[Jack Sparrow]] from ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', [[Forrest Gump]], [[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]], and [[Tony Montana]] from ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/michael-boltons-love-for-pirates-ruins-hip-hop-single/story-e6frfro0-1226053162711 |title=Michael Bolton's love for Jack Sparrow ruins Lonely Island's new hip hop single &#124; Information, Gadgets, Mobile Phones News & Reviews |publisher=News.com.au |date=May 10, 2011 |access-date=4 May 2012}}</ref>

In 2013 and 2014, Bolton appeared in [[Honda]] commercials in which he sings.

In 2015 Bolton sang on [[John Oliver]]'s ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|Last Week Tonight]]'' episode concerning the [[IRS]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: The IRS (HBO)|date=April 12, 2015|publisher=HBO|access-date=April 26, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn_Zln_4pA8}}</ref>

===Directing===
On May 10, 2018, it was announced that American Dream: Detroit (Exclusive), Michael Bolton film, would premiere on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 in Redford Theater.<ref>{{Citation|last=MichaelBoltonTV Michael Bolton|title=American Dream: Detroit|date=April 9, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV_9cvKpTi0|access-date=5 November 2018}}</ref> Despite Bolton being born in Connecticut, he fell in love with the city of Detroit and wanted to highlight its recent economic comeback.  This documentary features interviews with several business moguls, singers and other Detroit natives, including [[Christopher Ilitch]], [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Smokey Robinson]], and [[Alice Cooper]].  This "Love-Letter to Detroit" film is reported by the Crain's (a local business publication) in an article titled "Michael Bolton to appear at Redford Theatre for Detroit documentary premiere", written by Annalise Frank.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Annalise|first1=Frankhttp|title=Writer|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180511/news/660386/michael-bolton-to-appear-at-redford-theatre-for-detroit-documentary|access-date=May 11, 2018|agency=Crain's Detroit Business|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc|date=May 5, 2018}}</ref>

==Copyright infringement lawsuit==
On February 24, 1992, the American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group [[the Isley Brothers]] filed a lawsuit against Bolton, claiming his 1991 hit song "[[Love Is a Wonderful Thing (Michael Bolton song)|Love Is a Wonderful Thing]]" plagiarized their 1966 song of the same name.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBAEAAAAMBAJ&q=isley++love+is+a+wonderful+thing+first+appeared+on+album&pg=PA13 |title=Billboard |page=13 |date=June 27, 1992 |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref> 
 
A Los Angeles jury ruled in favor of the Isley Brothers on April 25, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1933&dat=19940426&id=FNogAAAAIBAJ&pg=3306,5695075&hl=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107001016/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1933&dat=19940426&id=FNogAAAAIBAJ&sjid=L2sFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3306,5695075&hl=en|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 7, 2016|title=McCook Daily Gazette – Google News Archive Search|date=January 7, 2016}}</ref> The jury determined there were five instances in which Bolton's song plagiarized the Isleys' tune. Bolton, co-writer Andrew Goldmark and Sony Publishing were ordered to turn over more than $5&nbsp;million in profits from the sales of Bolton's version of the song to the Isley Brothers. It was the largest award in history for plagiarism in the music industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairwagelawyers.com/most-famous-music-copyright-infringment.html |title=Famous Copyright Infringement Plagiarism cases in Music |website=Fairwagelawyers.com |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>

Bolton, Goldmark and Sony appealed the verdict, and the court fight continued for nearly seven more years. The case concluded on January 22, 2001, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] refused to hear the appeal of a May 2000 decision by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court Of Appeals]] in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80666/frustrated-michael-bolton-ready-to-move-on |title=Frustrated Michael Bolton Ready To Move On |magazine=Billboard |date=January 30, 2001 |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>

Under the Ninth Circuit ruling, the Isleys were to be paid $4.2&nbsp;million from Sony Music, $932,924 from Bolton, $220,785 from Goldmark, and the balance from Bolton and Goldmark's music publishing company.<ref>[http://mcir.usc.edu/cases/2000-2009/Pages/threeboysbolton.html Three Boys Music v. Michael Bolton 212 F.3d 477 (9th Cir.2000)] Mcir.usc.edu</ref>

A previous similar lawsuit, regarding his hit composition "[[How Am I Supposed to Live Without You]]" was settled in Bolton's favor, helped in part by testimony from the singer Laura Branigan.

==Charity work==
=== The Michael Bolton Foundation ===
In 1993, Bolton established The Michael Bolton Foundation, later renamed The Michael Bolton Charities, to assist women and children at risk from the effects of poverty as well as [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[physical abuse|physical]], and [[sexual abuse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelboltoncharities.com |title=The Michael Bolton Charities |publisher=The Michael Bolton Charities |access-date=May 21, 2010}}</ref> In the late 1990s the group was heavily criticized for the incredibly low percentage of contributions that went towards charity work.
