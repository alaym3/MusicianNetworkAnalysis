'''The Insyderz''' were an American [[Christian ska]]-punk [[musical band|band]] from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. They formed in 1996 and disbanded in 2005. The band reformed in 2009, but have not been actively playing shows in the last few years. The Insyderz are one of the "big three" bands which represented the Christian ska scene, alongside the [[Supertones]] and [[Five Iron Frenzy]].<ref name="Powell_Fe"/><ref name="7b_22">{{cite journal |last=Zhito |first=Lisa |date=January–February 1999 |title=Going Outside: The Insyderz are venturing beyon the confines of the Christian market |journal=[[7ball]] |issue=22 |pages=26–30 |url=//www.theinsyderz.com/press/i_7ball_1999_01.html |format=reprint |access-date=2007-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001013002258/http://www.theinsyderz.com/press/i_7ball_1999_01.html |archive-date=October 13, 2000 }}</ref> <!-- and their release ''[[Skalleluia]]'' is sometimes credited with... -->

== Band history ==
The Insyderz began from Joe Yerke and Nate Sjogren who led worship together at their church.<ref name="Bram_JFH">(4/23/99).

While that label folded soon after, the band's first album, ''[[Motor City Ska]]'' (1997), effectively established a presence in the Christian music marketplace and garnered the attention of [[Steve Taylor]]'s [[Squint Entertainment]].<ref name="SquintPress1">"[http://www.sockheaven.net/press/squint/pr_19980103.html SQUINT ENTERTAINMENT REACHES AGREEMENT WITH THE INSYDERZ]". [[Squint Entertainment]] press release, archived at [http://www.sockheaven.net sockheaven.net].</ref>

Their subsequent release, ''[[Skalleluia]]'', became their most successful album and ranked the highest in record sales for the band. The album consists of contemporary [[Contemporary worship music|praise and worship]] songs in ska and [[Ska punk|ska-punk]] renditions. Guest performances include Gene Eugene, [[Terry Scott Taylor]], and Steve Taylor.<ref name="Mendonca">{{cite journal |last=Mendonca |first=Joe |date=March–April 1998 |title=The Insyderz |journal=[[HM Magazine]] |url=//www.theinsyderz.com/press/i_hm_1998_03.html |format=reprint |access-date=2007-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000415114356/http://www.theinsyderz.com/press/i_hm_1998_03.html |archive-date=April 15, 2000 }}</ref> Despite the fact that their initial formation centered around turning praise and worship songs into ska<ref name="CCM_22_5"/><ref name="7b_17"/> the album faced criticism for "jumping on the [[Bandwagon effect|bandwagon]]" on praise and worship music's growing commercial appeal.<ref name="CCM_22_5">{{cite journal |last=Urbanski |first=Dave |date=November 1999 |title=Sequel Act |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=46–47 |url=//www.theinsyderz.com/press/r_ska2_ccm.html |format=reprint |access-date=2007-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001017115009/http://www.theinsyderz.com/press/r_ska2_ccm.html |archive-date=October 17, 2000 }}</ref> Beyond charting on [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'s "Hot 200" and "Heatseekers" charts and spending six months on their "Top Contemporary Christian" chart,<ref name="CCM_22_7">{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Bruce A. |date=January 2000 |title=Reviews / ''Skalleluia Too!'' |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=50 }}</ref> their rendition of [[Rich Mullins]]' song "[[Awesome God]]" won the band a [[Dove Award]] for "Hard Music Recorded Song of the Year" in 1999.<ref name="DOVE">"[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 Dove Award Recipients for 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022952/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 |date=2006-10-20 }}".

''Skalleluia'' became an unexpected hit for the band but differs from the sound the Insyderz had displayed on their own original material.<ref name="7b_22"/> ''Skalleluia'' broke the band into the national limelight, but somewhat restricted their audience to the church.

In support of ''Skalleluia!'' the band toured with [[Plankeye]] and [[Morella's Forest]].<ref name="7b_17">{{cite journal |title=Insyderz |pages=30–34 |date=March–April 1998 |issue=17 |journal=[[7ball]] |issn=1082-3980}}</ref> In 1999 they made an appearance on ''[[The 700 Club]]''<ref name="CCM_22_4">{{cite journal |last=Fernandez |first=Mike |date=October 1999 |title=Rock N Roll World |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=22 }}</ref> and embarked on an all-ska tour with the Skeletones and [[Jeffries Fan Club]].

In 2000 ''[[Skalleluia Too!]]'' was released. Within the next few years the band's website featured rare updates and touring seemed to halt which led to rumors of the band's demise. However, The Insyderz had become tired of record label politics and until business had been sorted out continued to perform on a much smaller scale. Many of the members of the band married including Nate Sjogren (drums), Bram Roberts (Trumpet), Beau McCarthy (Bass), Kyle Wasil (Guitar), and Joe Yerke (vocals). The band decided to spend more time working and ministering through other projects while never fully disbanding. Nate Sjogren, for instance, left to start a youth oriented church in Michigan with the help of the Salvation Army.<ref name="7b_29">{{cite journal |title=news / Progressive |pages=16 |date=March–April 2000 |issue=29 |journal=[[7ball]] |issn=1082-3980}}</ref>

In 2001 a compilation CD entitled ''[[The Greatest & The Rarest]]'' (or alternately ''Tails of a Comet'') was released, which consists of fifteen popular songs from their first four albums and six rare songs.

In 2003 they re-activated, appearing at [[Cornerstone Festival|Cornerstone]],<ref name="HM_Cstone_03">{{cite journal |last=Wilkinson |first=Aaron |year=2003 |title=Cornerstone FL 2003 |journal=[[HM Magazine]] |url=http://www.hmmagazine.com/oe/archives/000180.php |access-date=2007-02-01}}</ref> and releasing an album entitled ''[[Soundtrack to a Revolution]]''. After the release the Insyderz went through another lineup change adding [[Royce Nunley]] ([[Suicide Machines]]) and Dan Powers ([[Blueprint 76]]) on bass.

In the first half of 2005, the band announced on their website that they would be playing their last three shows in August and September of that year, which led to confusion on whether they were the band's last three shows or the tour's last three. Later, in August of the same year, the site was updated to announce that the band would be breaking up after their final show on September 24, 2005, as a part of the I'll Fight Fest presented by [[The Salvation Army]]. The show was performed with [[The O.C. Supertones]] who were also in the midst of a final tour. In 2009, the band got back together and in 2012, they released The Sinner's Songbook. In 2012, they did a short tour with Five Iron Frenzy, but have remained inactive in the past several years due to the band member's work schedules and family life. 

===Post break up===
Nate Sjogren has played drums in several other projects including ''Dead By Sunday'', ''The Paper Sound'', and the singer/songwriter ''[http://www.james-stephen.com James Stephen]''.

In December 2007, Todd, along with wife Sarah, welcomed their first child, a girl named Harper Rose Miesch. Both mother and baby are doing fine.

In January 2008 Todd Miesch received his first official teaching job teaching for Stoney Creek High School in Rochester, Michigan.

Michael Lloyd now lives in Los Angeles, and is currently working in the film industry. Nate and Beau work together at the Genesis church in Royal Oak, MI. Joe works as a police officer now.

==Reunion==
During 2011, The Insyderz launched a kickstarter campaign to fund their next album, ''The Sinner's Songbook'', and succeeded in raising the funds to do so.<ref name="Kickstarter">{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/280256462/the-insyderz-new-album-the-sinners-songbook/ |title=The Insyderz new album "The Sinner's Songbook" |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2016|reason=A secondary source is required}} In April 2012 The Insyderz began recording at Al Sutton's Rustbelt Studio in Royal Oak, MI with Producer/Engineer Eric Hoegemeyer, and released ''The Sinner's Songbook'' publicly on Labor Day, September 3, 2012. The band played some sporadic local shows during this time, which sometimes featured fill-in trombone players, including Kenny Plont, formerly of A Billion Ernies. However, trombone duties were usually performed by Tim Reynolds. Matt Darcie and John Miller played guitar and bass in the band during their reunion as well. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/280256462/the-insyderz-new-album-the-sinners-songbook/posts/299435 |title=DOWNLOAD SINNER'S SONGBOOK NOW!!!! |access-date=17 January 2016}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2016|reason=A secondary source is required}}
