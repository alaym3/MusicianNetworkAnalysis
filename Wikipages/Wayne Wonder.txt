==Biography==
===Early life===
Wonder was born in [[Buff Bay, Jamaica|Buff Bay]], [[Portland, Jamaica|Portland]], [[Jamaica]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p30005/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Craig Harris |publisher=Allmusic.com |access-date=11 October 2009}}</ref> He sang in [[Sunday school]] as a child,<ref name="Moskowitz">Moskowitz, David V. (2006) ''Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall'', Greenwood Press, {{ISBN|0-313-33158-8}}, p. 319-20</ref> and began songwriting at the age of 13, getting a major career break when he was given a regular weekly slot at Metro Media in Allman Town.<ref name="AMG" />

===Auditioning and debut album===
He auditioned at Sonic Sounds studio, but while [[Sly Dunbar]] was impressed, his touring commitments with [[Black Uhuru]] prevented him from signing Wonder. He had more success, however, with [[King Tubby]], who produced his first single, "Long and Lasting Love", in 1985, with two more following.<ref name="AMG" /><ref name="Moskowitz" /> Wonder's career suffered a setback when Tubby was killed in 1988, and he recorded for several other record producers at Sonic Sound, enjoying a further hit with the Lloyd Dennis-produced "It's Over Now", leading to the release of his first album, ''One More Chance'', although his success in this era was limited.

===Second album: ''Part 2'' and further releases===
His fortunes improved when he began working with [[Dave Kelly (producer)|Dave Kelly]], a friend from primary school, who had become resident [[audio engineering|sound engineer]] at Penthouse Studios.<ref name="AMG"/><ref name="Moskowitz" /> The partnership enjoyed a string of hits, starting with  "Saddest Day", and they also worked on Wonder's second album, ''Part 2''.<ref name="Moskowitz" /> His 1990 live performance of [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]]'s "[[Forever Young (Alphaville song)|Forever Young]]" was recorded and later released to Alphaville fans in a limited, cassette-only album entitled ''[[History (Alphaville album)|History]]''.<ref name="Alphaville Discography">[http://www.alphaville.info/main.htm ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> He toured the UK in 1992 along with other Penthouse stars [[Marcia Griffiths]], [[Tony Rebel]], and [[Buju Banton]].<ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (1998) ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae'', Virgin Books, {{ISBN|0-7535-0242-9}}, p. 320</ref> He also recorded "Bonafide Love (Movie Star)" with Buju Banton, and wrote several early hits for him, including the controversial "Boom Bye Bye".<ref name="AMG" /> He toured again with Banton in 1994 as part of the Penthouse Showcase.<ref name="Larkin" /> Wonder formed the band Alias along with Kelly, Baby Cham, Frisco Kid, and Frankie Sly, and later Entourage.<ref name="AMG" />

===Record label launch and further album releases===
In 2000, Wonder launched his own record label, Singso, and his 2000 album ''Da Vibe'' saw him begin to incorporate hip hop into his sound.<ref name="Moskowitz" /> He collaborated with several other major artists, including Jason Dalyrimple of [[Soul for Real]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], and [[Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]], and the move towards hip hop increased with his 2001 album ''Schizophrenic''.<ref name="AMG"/><ref name="Moskowitz" />

===Atlantic Records signing and international recognition===
His career really took off internationally when he signed to [[Atlantic Records]], achieving worldwide success with the song "[[No Letting Go (song)|No Letting Go]]" in 2003.  The song is based on the [[Diwali riddim]], which was also used by several other artists that year, such as [[Sean Paul]], [[Lumidee]] and [[Missy Elliott]]. The single reached No. 11 in the US<ref name="Billboard"/> and No. 3 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

"No Letting Go" and the album ''No Holding Back'' were a major success on urban radio stations in the US, and this prompted the release of several [[compilation album]]s featuring older Wonder material, including [[Trojan Records]]', ''[[Inna Bashment Style: The Roots Of An Urban Warrior]]'' (2005). 

===Further releases===
A new album, ''[[Foreva]]'' was released in 2007.<ref name="AMG"/> It reached No. 6 on the US Top Reggae Albums [[record chart|chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p30005/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic ((( Wayne Wonder > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums )))}}</ref>
