After attending [[Belmont High School (Los Angeles)|Belmont High School]], she studied music at [[Los Angeles City College]] supporting herself as a [[domestic worker]]. Flora  had hoped to see her daughter follow in the footsteps of [[Marian Anderson]], but Odetta doubted a large black girl like herself would ever perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]].<ref name=Weil2008/> In 1944 she made her professional debut in [[musical theater]] as an ensemble member for four years with the Hollywood [[Turnabout Theatre|Turnabout Puppet Theatre]], working alongside [[Elsa Lanchester]]. In 1949, she joined the national touring company of the musical ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]''.

While on tour with ''Finian's Rainbow'', Odetta "fell in with an enthusiastic group of young balladeers in San Francisco", and after 1950 she concentrated on folk singing.<ref>Odetta biography, 1956: back cover of ''Sings Ballads and Blues''.</ref>

She made her name playing at the Blue Angel nightclub in New York City, and the [[hungry i]] in San Francisco. At the Tin Angel in 1954, also in San Francisco, Odetta recorded ''[[The Tin Angel|Odetta and Larry]]'' with Larry Mohr for [[Fantasy Records]].

A solo career followed, with ''[[Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues]]'' (1957) and ''[[At the Gate of Horn]]'' (1957). ''[[Odetta Sings Folk Songs]]'' was one of the best-selling folk albums of 1963.

In 1959 she appeared on ''Tonight with Belafonte'', a nationally televised special. She sang "[[Waterboy (song)|Water Boy]]" and a duet with Belafonte, "[[There's a Hole in My Bucket]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spclarke.com/odetta.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106121134/http://www.spclarke.com/odetta.htm|url-status=dead|title=Odetta- American Folk Music Pioneer|archive-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref>

Broadening her musical scope, Odetta used band arrangements on several albums rather than playing alone. She released music of a more "jazz" style on albums like ''[[Odetta and the Blues]]'' (1962) and ''[[Odetta (Folkways album)|Odetta]]'' (1967). She gave a remarkable performance in 1968 at the [[Woody Guthrie]] memorial concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Woody Guthrie - The Tribute Concerts |url=https://woodyguthrie.org/projects/WGTributeConcerts.htm |website=Woodyguthrie.org |publisher=Woody Guthrie Publications, Inc. |access-date=28 January 2019}}</ref>

Odetta acted in several films during this period, including ''[[Cinerama Holiday]]'' (1955); a cinematic production of [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)|Sanctuary]]'' (1961); and ''[[The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman]]'' (1974). In 1961 she appeared in an episode of the TV series ''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]'', playing the wife of a man sentenced to hang ([https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0597609/ "The Hanging of Aaron Gibbs"]).

She was married twice, first to Dan Gordon and then, after their divorce, to Gary Shead. Her second marriage also ended in divorce. The blues singer-guitarist [[Louisiana Red]] was a former companion of hers.<ref name=Weil2008>

===Later career===
In May 1975 she appeared on public television's ''[[Basic Black|Say Brother]]'' program, performing "Give Me Your Hand" in the studio.  She spoke about her spirituality, the music tradition from which she drew, and her involvement in civil rights struggles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/3462e4-odetta-gordon-performs-give-me-your-hand|title=Odetta Gordon performs 'Give Me Your Hand'|publisher=WGBH OpenVault|access-date=2008-12-03}}</ref>

In 1976, Odetta performed in the U.S. Bicentennial opera ''Be Glad Then, America'' by [[John La Montaine]], as the Muse for America; with [[Donald Gramm]], Richard Lewis and the [[Penn State University]] Choir and the [[Pittsburgh Symphony]]. The production was directed by [[Sarah Caldwell]] who was the director of the Opera Company of Boston at the time.

Odetta released two albums in the 20-year period from 1977 to 1997: ''[[Movin' It On]]'', in 1987 and a new version of ''[[Christmas Spirituals]]'', produced by Rachel Faro, in 1988.

Beginning in 1998, she returned to recording and touring. The new CD ''[[To Ella]]'' (recorded live and dedicated to her friend [[Ella Fitzgerald]] upon hearing of her death before walking on stage),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/04/folk-jazz|title=Grit, guts and glory|last=Rogers|first=Jude|date=2008-12-03|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-30}}</ref> was released in 1998 on Silverwolf Records, followed by three releases on M.C.

Handy Award]]-nominated band tribute to [[Lead Belly]]; and the 2007 Grammy-nominated ''[[Gonna Let It Shine]]'', a live album of gospel and spiritual songs supported by Seth Farber and The Holmes Brothers. These recordings and active touring led to guest appearance on fourteen new albums by other artists between 1999 and 2006 and the re-release of 45 old Odetta albums and compilation appearances.

On September 29, 1999, President [[Bill Clinton]] presented Odetta with the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]' [[National Medal of Arts]].

The 2005 documentary film ''[[No Direction Home]]'', directed by [[Martin Scorsese]], highlights her musical influence on [[Bob Dylan]], the subject of the documentary. The film contains an archive clip of Odetta performing "[[The Waterboy (song)|Waterboy]]" on TV in 1959, as well as her "[[Mule Skinner Blues]]" and "No More Auction Block for Me".

Odetta influenced [[Harry Belafonte]], who  "cited her as a key influence" on his musical career;<ref name="NYT Obit" /> [[Bob Dylan]], who said, "The first thing that turned me on to folk singing was Odetta. I heard a record of hers ''[[Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues]]'' in a record store, back when you could listen to records right there in the store. Right then and there, I went out and traded my electric guitar and amplifier for an acoustical guitar, a flat-top [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]].&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
