The '''Geto Boys''' (originally spelled '''Ghetto Boys''') is an American [[hip hop]] group originally formed in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. The group was formed in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|title= Joe Rogan Experience #1570 - Willie D & Mike Judge|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvzs-VbEzds |website=youtube|access-date = 26 November 2020 }}</ref> The Geto Boys enjoyed success in the 1990s with the group's classic lineup consisting of [[Bushwick Bill]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] and [[Willie D]], earning several [[Recording Industry Association of America#Sales certification|certified]] albums and hit singles, including "[[Mind Playing Tricks on Me]]" which reached No. 1 on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] and #23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Geto Boys Biography |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwclassical/classical/Geto-Boys/bio |website=Broadway World |access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref>

The Geto Boys earned notoriety for lyrics covering controversial topics such as [[misogyny]], gore, [[psychotic]] experiences, and [[necrophilia]]. [[About.com]] ranked the Geto Boys No.&nbsp;10 on its list of the 25 Best Rap Groups of All-Time, describing them as "[[southern rap]] pioneers who paved the way for future southern hip-hop acts."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rap.about.com/od/artist1/tp/BestHipHopGroups.01.htm | title=25 Best Rap Groups of All-Time | website=About.com | access-date=27 March 2014 | author=Adaso,  Henry}}</ref>

==History==
The original Geto Boys consisted first of Raheem, The Sire Jukebox and Sir Rap-A-Lot.  When Raheem and Sir Rap-A-Lot left, the group added DJ Ready Red, Prince Johnny C, and Little Billy, the dancer who later came to be known as [[Bushwick Bill]]. The first single the group released was "Car Freak" in 1986, which then followed with two singles: "You Ain't Nothin'/I Run This" in 1987, and "Be Down" in 1988. In 1988, the group released its debut album, ''[[Making Trouble]]''. With the release receiving very little attention, the group broke up shortly thereafter and a new line-up was put together in which Bushwick Bill was joined by Scarface and Willie D, both aspiring solo artists. This new line-up recorded the 1989 album, ''[[Grip It! On That Other Level]]''. The group's 1990 self-titled album, ''[[The Geto Boys (album)|The Geto Boys]]'', caused [[Def American Recordings]], the label to which the group was signed at the time, to switch distributors from [[Geffen Records]] to [[Warner Bros. Records]] (with marketing for the album done by Warner Bros. sister label [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]]) because of controversy over the lyrics.

In the early 1990s, several American politicians attacked rap artists associated with the subgenre [[gangsta rap]], including the Geto Boys. A high-profile incident in which Bushwick Bill lost an eye in a shooting helped boost sales of the group's 1991 album ''[[We Can't Be Stopped]]''. The album cover features a graphic picture of the injured Bushwick being carted through a hospital by Scarface and Willie D. On the album's title track, the group responded to [[Geffen Records]] ending its distribution deal with Def American. The album featured the single "[[Mind Playing Tricks on Me]]," which became a hit and charted at No.&nbsp;23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

After Willie D left the group, Scarface and Bushwick Bill continued with the Geto Boys with the addition of [[Big Mike (rapper)|Big Mike]], who made his debut appearance with the group on 1993's album ''[[Till Death Do Us Part (Geto Boys album)|Till Death Do Us Part]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=LeBlanc |first1=Ondine |title=The Geto Boys |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/geto-boys |website=Encyclopedia |access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref> ''Till Death Do Us Part'' was certified gold. The album spawned one top 40 hit in "Six Feet Deep" which peaked at #40 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Subsequently, Big Mike was dropped and Willie D returned for 1996's critically acclaimed ''[[The Resurrection (Geto Boys album)|The Resurrection]]'', and the 1998 followup ''[[Da Good Da Bad & Da Ugly]]'', of which Bushwick Bill was not a part. After three years on hiatus, the group reunited in 2002 to record its seventh album, ''[[The Foundation (Geto Boys album)|The Foundation]]'', which was released on January 25, 2005. The Geto Boys were featured on Scarface's ''[[My Homies Part 2]]'' album.

The song "Street Life" from ''Till Death Do Us Part'' was featured on the motion picture ''[[South Central (film)|South Central]]''. A video clip for the song with footage from the film was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnyC-NPEPtk |title=geto boys street life |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2007-04-19 |access-date=2012-03-31}}</ref> Although the band rarely releases albums or perform together, the group came together for a reunion at [[Cypress Hill]]'s SmokeOut festival in [[San Bernardino, California]] on October 23, 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2009/09/smoke-out-festival-2009-offers-reunited-bands-and-munchies/|title=Smoke Out Festival 2009 offers reunited bands and munchies…|date=2009-09-01|newspaper=Consequence of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref> In 2010, Bushwick Bill was threatened with deportation to Jamaica.<ref>Carroll, Susan.

==Lyrics and influence==
The group's name, Geto Boys, comes from an alternate spelling of the word "[[ghetto]]". For its first two albums, ''Making Trouble'' (1988) and ''Grip It! On That Other Level'' (1989), the spelling was the English standard "Ghetto Boys". For their third album, ''The Geto Boys'', they changed it to the "Geto" spelling, which the group has used since. The Geto Boys' lyrics push gangsta rap themes to extremes, and sometimes focus on [[murder]], explicit [[sex]], and violence. The group is credited for putting [[Southern hip hop]] on the hip hop music map and inspired a legion of acts, including [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], [[Eminem]], [[UGK]], [[T.I.]], [[Goodie Mob]], [[Outkast]], [[50 Cent]], [[Chamillionaire]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], [[Mystikal]], [[Mac Lethal]], [[Esham]]<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/> and [[Insane Clown Posse]].<ref name="TheOpening">{{cite video |people=[[Violent J]] (performer) |date=2010-06-08 |title=The Opening |medium=song |publisher=Hatchet House/Psychopathic Records |time=0:54 |quote=Much love to Cube, Awesome Dre, The Geto Boys, and Esham / for making us want to be rappers, self employed, and the bomb }}</ref> Insane Clown Posse's [[Violent J]] (Joseph Bruce) described the Geto Boys as the first rappers to perform [[horrorcore]], with their song "Assassins", released on their debut album, ''Making Trouble''.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.spin.com/2011/10/insane-clown-posses-violent-j-picks-11-horrorcore-classics/?page=0%2C5 |title=Insane Clown Posse's Violent J Picks 11 Horrorcore Classics |author=Weingarten, Christopher |date=October 28, 2011 |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |access-date=4 November 2011}}</ref> Bruce says that the Geto Boys continued to pioneer the style with their second release ''Grip It!

The Geto Boys' popularity was boosted somewhat in 1999 by the prominent use of two songs—"Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta" (released as a promotional single for the 1992 compilation album ''Uncut Dope'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Geto-Boys-Damn-It-Feels-Good-To-Be-A-Gangster/release/1267770 |title=Geto Boys - Damn It Feels Good To Be A Gangster (CD) at Discogs |website=Discogs.com |access-date=2012-03-31}}</ref> and "Still" (from ''The Resurrection'')—in [[Mike Judge]]'s comedy satire film ''[[Office Space]]''. The song "Mind of a Lunatic" has been covered by many recording acts including [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] in 2003, as a B-side off the album ''[[The Golden Age of Grotesque]]''. The single "Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta" has also been covered by the band [[Aqueduct (band)|Aqueduct]] and country singer Carter Falco.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjgWgjOyhuo |title=Aqueduct - "Damn it Feels Good to Be a Gangster"'' |access-date=2007-12-21 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Their song "Mind Playing Tricks on Me" was featured in the [[video game]] ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' and also in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Maniac (miniseries)|Maniac]]''.

The Geto Boys are also heavily influenced by the social politics of the day. Their lyrics have consistently included themes ranging from police brutality (such as in "Crooked Officer") to concerns over the negative impact of violence on the urban community (such as "The World Is a Ghetto", "Geto Fantasy", and "Six Feet Deep").{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
