'''Wouter Otto Levenbach''' ({{IPA-nl|ʋɑu̯tər oto levənbaχ}}; born 4 May 1944), known as '''Dave''', is a Dutch [[French language|Francophone]] singer who had a string of number one hits in [[France]] in the 1970s. A native of [[Amsterdam]], he resides in [[Paris]].

== Early life and education ==
Dave was born in [[Amsterdam]]. His father was Jewish and an English teacher by trade; his mother was a classical dancer. He has two brothers, Marteen and Lucas, and a sister, Elsbeth. He learned how to play guitar at 14 years of age.<ref name="clubs">[http://www.clubs.nl/community/default.asp?clubid=14487 Biographie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040822142704/http://www.clubs.nl/community/default.asp?clubid=14487 |date=22 August 2004 }} at ''clubs.nl'' (Dutch)</ref> He became a very spiritual person who prayed frequently and even planned to study theology; however, he eventually chose to study law.

Among other things, he was inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]'s '' [[On the Road]] '', a revolutionary novel which incited the young people of the world to leave to learn the life on the roads, and to communicate with others. Passionate about the sea and rivers (a love which he owes to his grandfather), he left the [[Netherlands]] by boat with 1,000 [[Dutch Guilder|guilders]] in his pocket (about two months' living expenses).<ref name="purepeople">{{cite web|url=http://www.purepeople.com/people/dave_p1428| language=fr |title=Dave – Toute l'actu ! |publisher=Purepeople |accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>

== Musical career ==
=== 1960s: Beginnings ===
He met [[Eddie Barclay]], the executive for [[Barclay Records]], in [[Saint-Tropez]] in 1968; Barclay was responsible for launching Dave's career in show business.<ref name=purepeople />

[[File:Nationale finale van het Eurovisie Songfestival in Scheveningen nr. 17 Dave, Bestanddeelnr 922-1434.jpg|thumb|Dave in 1969]]
On 26 February 1969, he participated in the [[Nationaal Songfestival]], the Dutch pre-selection contest for that year's [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|Eurovision Song Contest]] with a song called "Niets gaat zo snel", but did not win. In Summer 1969 he reached the [[Dutch Top 40]] charts for the first time with "Nathalie", peaking at No. 28.

=== 1970s: Peak ===
From 1971 to 1974, he was one of the actors in the musical ''[[Godspell]]'', making friends with actor [[Daniel Auteuil]], who would become his best friend.<ref name="trouw">{{cite news|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/3356702/2012/12/01/Het-is-de-moeite-waard-voor-je-relatie-te-vechten.dhtml| language=nl |title=Het is de moeite waard voor je relatie te vechten |newspaper=Trouw |accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>

In 1974, he released his first hit "Trop Beau", a French adaptation of [[The Rubettes]]' hit "[[Sugar Baby Love]]"; later, he released "Vanina", his first number one single in France, an adaptation of [[Del Shannon]]'s "[[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|Runaway]]", adapted into French by {{Interlanguage link multi|Patrick Loiseau|fr}}. These were followed in 1975 by the three hits "Mon cœur est malade", "Dansez maintenant" and "Du côté de chez Swann".

His self-titled first album was released at the end of 1975. By that time, he did not only have great success in France and [[Belgium]], but also in his country of origin the Netherlands, where "Dansez maintenant" was a number 1 hit in the top 40 and "Du côté de chez Swann" made the top 10 too.<ref>[[:nl:Dave (zanger)#Singles]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2021}}

His later hits included "Lettre à Hélène" (1978), "Comment ne pas être amoureux de vous" (1978) and "Allo Elisa" (1979).<ref name="discogs">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/468108-Dave-13 |title=Dave – Discography|publisher=discogs |accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
In the 1980s, his popularity waned following the advent of FM radio in France. He still had an audience due to live performances<ref>" [[Music-Hall]], [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]] a vu Dave, l'homme qui vend du rêve... ", ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]'', 20 May 1982 ([[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]], May 1982).</ref> and his classic hits. However, he himself likened the ebb to a "crossing of a very pretty desert". In 1993, he released a new album,<ref name=discogs /> then in 1994, he made a comeback following the release of a greatest hits album, which sold more than 200,000 copies. He later recorded a new album entitled ''Toujours le même bleu'', which included a title single from which enables him to hit the charts once again. It is also around this time that Dave revealed himself as homosexual.

In 1996, he appeared in a commercial for Dutch cheese. He later became a [[television presenter|co-presenter]] with [[Sheila (singer)|Sheila]] of the [[TF1]] television program ''Salut les Chouchous''; after a year, he assumed the presenter duties alone. In 1997, publisher Lattès Editions published Dave's autobiography, ''Du côté de chez moi'' ("Around where I live"). An album, ''Dave classique'', was released, fulfilling his dream to record some classical compositions.

=== 2000s and 2010s ===
From 2001 to 2005 Dave presented together with [[Flavie Flament]] and [[Denis Brogniart]] the TV event ''[[Domino Day]]'' on [[TF1]].<ref name=clubs />
In 2003, he released another autobiographical book, ''Soit dit en passant... mes années paillettes'', which dealt with his life as a showbiz celebrity in the 1970s. The book also revealed the love story which has united Dave with his lyricist and companion {{Interlanguage link multi|Patrick Loiseau|fr}} for more than thirty years. The latter also participated in the work to share his version of the events.<ref name="24heures">{{cite web|url=http://www.24heures.ch/culture/Dave-l-eternel-retour-de-lidole-des-jeunes/story/22100132| language=fr |title=Dave, l'éternel retour de l’idole des jeunes |publisher=24heures |accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>

In 2006, he released a new album under the name of "Dave Levenbach", ''Tout le plaisir a été pour moi''.<ref name=discogs /> In September 2006, he played four special concerts at the ''Théâtre de l'Européen'' in Paris.

He was awarded Knight of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] on 17 April 2015.<ref name="telegraaf">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/23939473/__Zanger_Dave_geridderd__.html| language=nl |title=Nederlandse zanger Dave in Parijs geridderd |newspaper=[[De Telegraaf]] |date=17 April 2015 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>
