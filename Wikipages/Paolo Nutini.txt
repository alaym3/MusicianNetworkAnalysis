Among other accolades, Nutini has received three [[Brit Awards|BRIT Award]] nominations and an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] nomination for songwriting.

==Early life ==
Nutini was born in Paisley, Scotland, and has a younger sister. His father, Alfredo, is a Scot of Italian descent from [[Barga, Tuscany|Barga]] in Tuscany, while his mother, Linda, is [[Scottish people|Scottish]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/exclusive-paolo-my-family-home-935244|title=EXCLUSIVE: PAOLO 'MY FAMILY HOME IS THE MOST AMAZING PLACE IN THE WORLD'|last=McIver|first=Brian|date=1 August 2006|website=dailyrecord|access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/paolo-nutinis-dad-tells-hed-3276227|title=Paolo Nutini's dad tells why he'd love his son to inherit family chippie but admits it's unlikely to happen|last=Holmes|first=Jeff|date=24 March 2014|work=dailyrecord}}</ref> He was expected to follow his father into the family fish and chip shop business.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/paolo-nutini-interview-there-s-a-guy-works-down-the-chip-shop-9491750.html|title=Paolo Nutini interview: There’s a guy works down the chip shop...|last=McNair|first=James|date=6 June 2014|language=en-GB|access-date=29 September 2016}}</ref> As a child he attended [[PACE Youth Theatre]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacetheatre.com/youththeatre/members/former-members/|title=Former Members|date=1 June 2013|website=PACE|language=en-US|access-date=16 January 2020}}</ref> He was first encouraged to sing by his music-loving grandfather, Giovanni "Jackie" Nutini, and a teacher at his school, [[St Andrew's Academy, Paisley|St Andrews Academy]], who recognised his talent.

Nutini left school to work as a [[road crew|roadie]] and to sell t-shirts for Scottish band [[Speedway (band)|Speedway]]. He spent three years learning the music business and performing live. He later worked as a studio hand at Glasgow's Park Lane Studio. It was here where he started demo-ing songs, writing with Jim Duguid and the drummer of Speedway.<ref name=":0"/>

His big chance came when his younger family member signed him up to his first live show [[102.5 Clyde 1]] for [[David Sneddon]]'s return to his home town of Paisley at the beginning of 2003. Sneddon was delayed, and as the winner of an impromptu pop quiz, Nutini was given the chance to perform a couple of songs on stage during the wait. The favourable reaction of the crowd impressed another member of the audience, Brendan Moon, who offered to become his manager with his business partner, Mike Bawden. Mike Bawden continues to manage Nutini.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/13203138.Stars_back_plans_to_stage_T_in_the_Park_at_Strathallan_Castle/|title=Stars back plans to stage T in the Park at Strathallan Castle|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref>

At 17, Nutini moved to London and performed regularly at [[The Bedford]] pub in [[Balham, London|Balham]] with local Singer-Songwriter Charlie Wallis.{{cn|date=May 2021}} Other radio and live appearances followed, including two live acoustic spots on [[BBC London 94.9|Radio London]], [[The Hard Rock Cafe]], and support slots for [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[KT Tunstall]]. Nutini became known for singing with his eyes closed during his entire performances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

==Career==

=== ''These Streets'' (2005–2007) ===
{{main|These Streets}} 
Nutini made his first demo which saw him signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in May 2005, shortly after his 18th birthday. He released his first single "These Streets" as a free download in May 2006; this was then followed by his next single "[[Last Request]]" which was released on 4 July 2006 and charted at number five on the UK Singles Chart.
In the video for "Last Request", Nutini plays the part of a robber – though this is not revealed until the end.
Nutini's third single, "[[Jenny Don't Be Hasty]]", was released on 25 September 2006 and got to number twenty on the UK Singles Chart. "[[Rewind (Paolo Nutini song)|Rewind]]" was Nutini's fourth single. It was released on 4 December 2006, and reached number twenty seven on the UK Singles Chart.

Nutini's debut album ''[[These Streets]]'', produced by [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]] (who has also worked with [[Coldplay]] and [[Gomez (band)|Gomez]]), was released on 17 July 2006 and immediately entered the UK album charts at number three. Many of the songs on the album, including "Last Request" and "Rewind", were inspired by a turbulent relationship with his former girlfriend Teri Brogan, and "Jenny Don't Be Hasty" is a true story about encounters with an older woman.
Commenting on ''These Streets'', Nutini himself states on his official website, "The album is a little glimpse of some of the experiences I have been through in the last three years". In late 2007, Nutini covered [[Labi Siffre]]'s "[[It Must Be Love (Labi Siffre song)|It Must Be Love]]" for [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''[[Radio 1 Established 1967]]'' album.

Throughout 2006, Nutini played a number of sold-out concerts across Britain and performed at a wide variety of venues worldwide, including [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] in Glasgow, a TV appearance on [[Later with Jools Holland]], [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York, The [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], The [[Wireless Festival]], [[Oxegen]] and [[T in the Park]]. He supported [[the Rolling Stones]] in Vienna and was invited to appear with them again at the [[Don Valley Stadium]] in August 2006 and was also booked to appear at the [[V Festival]] and The [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]], Texas, later in 2006, with a European tour in the autumn. In May 2006, Nutini also played at [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Big Weekend]] in Dundee.

Nutini performed at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 2007 on the famous Pyramid Stage on the second day of the event. Nutini also performed at the [[Live Earth concert, London|British leg]] of [[Live Earth]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 7 July 2007, with his set including a cover of "[[What A Wonderful World]]", a classic pop tune by [[Bob Thiele]], [[George David Weiss]], and George Douglas. He performed the following day at [[T in the Park]], in Scotland.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/tinthepark/artists/paolo_nutini] {{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref> He performed at the [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] on 10 December 2007, an event that drew enormous international attention as it was the first full live concert performance by [[Led Zeppelin]] in 27 years. Scottish independent TV company Volt MediaFix made a one-off documentary of Nutini's US tour. The programme, for the BBC, was scheduled for broadcast on BBC2, on Thursday 7 June throughout Scotland and on Sky channel 990 throughout the rest of Britain.

The third single from the album was "[[Pencil Full of Lead]]".

The album received a mixed critical reception. Some noted the move away from the sound of the debut album.<ref name="Jurek">Jurek, Thom "[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1567232/review|pure_url=yes}} ''Sunny Side Up'' Review]", ''Allmusic'', Macrovision Corporation</ref> Neil McCormick of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was also positive, stating "his joyous second album organically blends soul, country, folk and the brash, horny energy of ragtime swing."<ref name="McCormick">McCormick, Neil (2009) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090605172754/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/neilmccormick/5393530/Paolo-Nutini-Sunny-Side-Up-CD-review.html Paolo Nutini: Sunny Side Up, CD review]", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 29 May 2009</ref> Some reviewers were less impressed.

The album debuted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] with sales of over 60,000 copies, fighting off strong competition from ''[[Love & War (Daniel Merriweather album)|Love & War]]'', the debut album of fellow male solo artist [[Daniel Merriweather]]. The album performed similarly well on the [[Irish Albums Chart]], debuting at number two behind [[Eminem]]'s new album before rising to the top of the charts the week after.
