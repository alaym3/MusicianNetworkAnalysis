The hospital has its origins as the third Surrey County Pauper Lunatic Asylum, designed by [[Charles Henry Howell]]<ref name="croydonadvertiser1">{{cite news|url=https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/amazing-history-cane-hill-hospital-1010511 |author= Truelove, Sam|title=The amazing history of Cane Hill Hospital in Coulsdon which was destroyed by a fire 8 years ago |work=[[Croydon Advertiser]] |date=6 January 2018 |access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> and built in two stages between 1882 and 1888.<ref name=lost>{{cite web|url=https://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/canehill.html|title=Cane Hill Hospital|publisher=Lost Hospitals of London|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref> The design which involved a 'radiating pavilion' layout was original.<ref name=lost/> The hospital was taken over by London County Council in 1889.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://museumofcroydoncollections.com/catalogues/index.php/cane-hill-hospital |title=Cane Hill Hospital – Museum of Croydon: Collections |publisher=Museumofcroydoncollections.com |access-date=2018-05-26}}</ref>

The hospital took in a large number of discharged mentally ill servicemen during the [[World War I|First World War]], the earliest patient recorded being admitted in 1915<ref name="croydonadvertiser1"/> but later discharged to another hospital in 1923. Records for nearly 40 such service patients – some of whom died and were interred in the hospital cemetery – have been found.<ref name=sgw>{{cite web|url=http://www.surreyinthegreatwar.org.uk/story/the-forgotten-servicemen-of-cane-hill/|publisher=Surrey in the Great War|title=The forgotten servicemen of Cane Hill|year=2015|first= Brian |last=Roote}}</ref> It was renamed the Cane Hill Mental Hospital in 1930.<ref name=lost/>

By the late 1980s the number of patients had greatly declined, largely due to the recommendations of the Mental Health Act (1983) with its emphasis on [[care in the community]].<ref name=lost/> Following a gradual winding down of hospital services and operations, the entire hospital with the exception of a small secure unit had closed in March 1991.<ref name=lost/> The secure unit moved into what had been the Coulsdon [[Cottage Hospital]]: in 2006 it held 23 patients and was run by the [[South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust]] (SLaM). The unit closed in February 2008, with the patients and staff being transferred to the River House, a new Medium Secure Unit at [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=McKinnell|first=Ellie|date=2019-11-20|title=The fascinating story behind the creepy Cane Hill asylum|url=https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/fascinating-story-behind-croydons-historic-17256705|access-date=2021-02-03|website=MyLondon|language=en}}</ref><ref name=lost/>

Demolition of Cane Hill started in March 2008 and was completed by the end of 2010. Only the chapel, administration building and water tower remained.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/hta-given-go-ahead-to-redevelop-cane-hill-asylum-site/8625219.article|title=HTA given go-ahead to redevelop Cane Hill Asylum site|date=20 January 2012|publisher=Architects' Journal|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref>

On 13 November 2010 a fire took hold in the administration block and went on to destroy all but the front facade of the building. The fire also destroyed the iconic clock tower. At about midnight, firefighters saw the clocktower crash to the ground in the blaze. The fire had been started in the basement of the building, draughting its way up through the ground and first floors before finally destroying the roof.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/8638818.UPDATE__Cane_Hill_building_extensively_damaged_by_fire/|title=Historic Cane Hill asylum building damaged by fire|date=16 January 2010|publisher=Your Local Guardian|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref>

==Hospital cemetery==
The hospital had a cemetery on Portnalls Road for inmates which was last used for burials in September 1950 and was deconsecrated and cleared at the hospital site's redevelopment in 1981 when remains of nearly 6,000 people were exhumed and cremated at [[Croydon Cemetery]] in Mitcham Road.<ref name=croycit>{{cite web|url=http://thecroydoncitizen.com/politics-society/memorial-soldiers-can-hill/|publisher=The Croydon Citizen|title=In memory of the soldiers of Cane Hill|first=Sean |last=Creighton|date=27 August 2015}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Among the remains were those of British [[First World War]] servicemen, who were known to have had separate areas in the cemetery where they had been originally buried with military honours.<ref name=croycit/> Research from plans indicated there were two designated main 'Service Plots', numbered 411 and 420, where six were buried in each grave.<ref name=sgw/> Eighteen of these, who had qualified for commemoration by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC),<ref>Those who qualified for CWGC commemoration would have died before 31 August 1921 of causes officially attributed to effects of military service.

==Legacy==
A drawing of Cane Hill Hospital is featured on the front cover of the US release of [[David Bowie]]'s 1970 album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', apparently because his half brother, Terry, had been a patient there.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-The-Man-Who-Sold-The-World/release/710468 |title=David Bowie – The Man Who Sold The World (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=2018-05-26}}</ref> Metal band [[Cane Hill (band)|Cane Hill]] based their name on the Cane Hill Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/25210/Cane-Hill-announce-new-EP-premiere-song|title=Cane Hill announce new EP, premiere song|publisher=Lambgoat|access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref>
