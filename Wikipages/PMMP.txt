'''PMMP''' was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[pop rock]] band fronted by singers [[Paula Vesala]] and [[Mira Luoti]] and backed by musicians [[Mikko Virta]], [[Juho Vehmanen]] and [[Heikki Kytölä]]. The name of the band is often said to be an abbreviation of the sentence "Paulan ja Miran Molemmat Puolet", which can be translated in English as "Both Sides of Paula and Mira". However, in an interview on the Finnish [[talk show]] [[Krisse Salminen|Krisse Show]], they stated that the name of the band comes, like [[ABBA]], from the names of 4 of its members: so PMMP is Paula, Mira, Mira, Paula. PMMP's albums were produced by former [[Thergothon]] drummer [[Jori Sjöroos]], who also wrote the music for all the songs. The lyrics are written by Paula and Mira. The band is an acclaimed live act.

PMMP first became well known in Finland with the 2003 summer hit ''Rusketusraidat'' ("''Tan Lines''"). They then enjoyed great success with their second album ''Kovemmat kädet'' ("''Rougher Hands''"), which sold gold (double platinum year 2010). An extended version of the album was released in August 2005. ''Oo siellä jossain mun'', a single from the aforementioned album, is PMMP's biggest hit so far in Finland.

In November 2006 PMMP released their third album ''Leskiäidin tyttäret'' ("''Daughters of a widow mother''"), which sold platinum on the day it was released.

They released an album labeled ''Puuhevonen'' ("''Wooden Horse''") with traditional children's songs in 2007, around the time their first children were born. In 2009 they released their fourth rock/pop album ''Veden varaan'' ("''Overboard''") and their fifth album ''Rakkaudesta'' ("''Of Love''"), released in 2012, is considered as their comeback album.

PMMP played their final concert on October 27, 2013 in the sold-out [[Helsinki Ice Hall]].

=="Matka jatkuu vaan" – The Journey Continues==
In an article titled "Matka jatkuu vaan" in the biggest Finnish newspaper [[Helsingin Sanomat]] (17.2.2007), journalist Leena Virtanen attempts to explain how it is that PMMP appeal to both children and adults, concluding that while indeed an energetic pop band PMMP "live within the space between childhood and adulthood", referring to the lifeworlds of both children and adults, carried through with eternal optimism. Virtanen concludes with the words from one of PMMP's best known songs "Matkalaulu" (travel song), which is in fact a song about the band being on the road: "Tämä voi olla koko elämämme ihanin päivä. Ajetaan hiljempaa. Toivon, että matka jatkuu, jatkuu vaan" [This could be the most wonderful day of our whole life. Let's drive slower. I hope the journey goes on, goes on and on..."]

==Activism==
PMMP has supported [[Amnesty International]]'s work against the violence towards women. The song ''Joku raja'' from the album ''Leskiäidin tyttäret'' is named after Amnesty's campaign by the same name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amnestystore.fi/news/17/|title=29.4.2011 - PMMP tukee Amnestyn Joku raja -kampanjaa - osta valokuvavedokset ja paidat Storesta! &#124; Amnesty Store|publisher=Amnestystore.fi|date=2011-04-29|accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>

On 25 May 2013 PMMP was supposed to perform together with two members of the Russian punk band [[Pussy Riot]] at the [[Maailma kylässä]] (World Village) festival in [[Helsinki]]. The members of Pussy Riot had disappeared and PMMP performed without them but supported their cause for human rights in Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/pussy_riot_members_cancel_appearances_whereabouts_unknown/6658931|title=Pussy Riot members cancel appearances, whereabouts unknown &#124; Yle Uutiset|publisher=[[Yle]]|date=25 May 2013|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref>

Following that event, after 10 years of performing, the group disbanded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/popstars/2013102717652671_ps.shtml|title=PMMP:n viimeinen keikka tänään Helsingissä|work=[[Iltalehti]]|date=27 October 2013|accessdate=7 May 2018}}</ref>
