==History==
[[File:Mark Wystrach.jpg|thumb|Mark Wystrach performing at the 2018 99.9 KISS Country Cook Off.]]

Named after the [[Dwight Yoakam]] song "Fair to Midland", the band was founded in [[Dripping Springs, Texas]]. The trio met separately around Los Angeles, where Jess Carson and Cameron Duddy had formed an earlier band. Duddy and Mark Wystrach met and formed a band after Carson left L.A. and moved to Texas. The trio met up in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]] for Duddy's wedding in August 2013; both Wystrach and Carson acted as groomsmen.<ref name="people" /> As Duddy recalls the story, Carson and Wystrach arrived in Jackson Hole for the wedding a week early. After playing songs together on the front porch of Carson's cabin, they decided to form the band. After Duddy's honeymoon, they went to the Sonic Ranch in El Paso, TX; as stated by Wystrach, "when we went to the Sonic Ranch, we became a band. We walked away believing in what had happened." The band re-based in Texas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7557562/midland-trio-country-video|title=Meet Midland, a Country Trio to Watch from Taylor Swift's Record Label: Exclusive Video|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-midland-on-the-rocks-20170926-story.html|title=Country trio Midland 'went all in' and came out on top with debut album 'On the Rocks'|date=2017-09-26|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

Mark Wystrach grew up surrounded by music as his parents were both fans of live music. His father was an immigrant living in Los Angeles. His mother grew up on a ranch near [[Tucson, Arizona]]. His parents owned a live honky-tonk country music venue. Wystrach is also an actor and model.<ref name="people">{{cite web|url=http://people.com/country/midland-five-things-to-know/|title=Meet Midland: Five Things to Know About the Texas Country Trio|last=Kimble|first=Lindsay|date=February 23, 2017|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

[[File:Midland in concert - Cameron Duddy.jpg|upright|thumb|Cameron Duddy]]
Cameron Duddy started playing music after a difficult situation in his family; he found that music helped to lessen the tension, saying, "Sometimes you don't get to talk about all the things that you maybe want to talk about and the ice breaker started to be music." He got his first guitar from his father; it helped him find his identity.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2017/02/20/whos-new-midland/|title=Who’s New: Midland|date=2017-02-20|work=Nash Country Daily|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}</ref>
