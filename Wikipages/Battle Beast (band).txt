The rest of the original lineup, bassist Eero Sipilä, keytarist Janne Björkroth and lead singer Nitte Valo, joined the band after auditions.

==History==
Battle Beast was founded by guitarist Anton Kabanen. Before gaining a record contract, Battle Beast was best known for having won two major band competitions in year 2010: the international Wacken Metal Battle 2010, participated by thousands of bands from all around the world, whose final stage was held at the famed German metal festival [[Wacken Open Air]];<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/battle-beast-confirmed-for-germany-s-wacken-open-air-festival/ |title=BATTLE BEAST Confirmed For Germany's WACKEN OPEN AIR Festival |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2014 }}</ref> soon after that, the band was announced the winner of Radio Rock Starba, a band competition held by the major Finnish radio station [[Radio Rock]]. With their victory in the Finnish competition the band received intense media exposure, and before the end of 2010 they had signed a record deal with the Finnish label Hype Records.

Battle Beast's first album, titled ''[[Steel (Battle Beast album)|Steel]]'', was released in Finland in Spring 2011. With the support of the two singles, "Show Me How to Die" and "Enter the Metal World", and their heavy airplay on Radio Rock, the album peaked at No. 7 upon its release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://finnishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Battle+Beast&titel=Steel&cat=a |title=Battle Beast - Steel (album) |work=Finnishcharts.com |publisher=[[Media Control Charts]] |accessdate=18 August 2014 }}</ref> Although released only in Finland, the album soon caught the attention of the international metal label [[Nuclear Blast]], with whom the band signed a licensing deal in late 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/battle-beast-signs-with-nuclear-blast-records/ |title=BATTLE BEAST Signs With NUCLEAR BLAST RECORDS |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2014 }}</ref> A reissue of ''Steel'', which included one bonus track, was released to the European market in January 2012.
