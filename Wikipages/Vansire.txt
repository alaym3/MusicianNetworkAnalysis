== History ==
===Formation===
Vansire formed as band members Josh Augustin (vocals, synths, guitar, and drums) and Sam Winemiller (bass, guitar, and synths) were attending [[Century High School (Rochester, Minnesota)|Century High School]] in Rochester, Minnesota.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.postbulletin.com/magazines/507/rockchester-festival-highlights-our-city-s-young-musicians/article_cc66f666-67f1-11e7-99ac-5f980a51efda.html|title=ROCKchester festival highlights our city's young musicians|last=Colby|first=Claire|date=13 July 2017|website=Post Bulletin|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714023530/https://www.postbulletin.com/magazines/507/rockchester-festival-highlights-our-city-s-young-musicians/article_cc66f666-67f1-11e7-99ac-5f980a51efda.html|archive-date=14 July 2017|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> Augustin and Winemiller met while playing together on the school's [[drumline]] and continued to find themselves performing together through school activities (such as concert band and pit orchestra), something the duo says contributed to their creative synergy and friendship, which later helped in Vansire's formation.<ref name="JonesOberlin2018" />

In the summer of 2015, Winemiller approached Augustin after practice for the school's drumline with an idea to make a band "that sounds like [[Mac DeMarco|Mac [DeMarco]]]". The pair's early recordings were made by holding instruments to the internal microphone of an [[iPad]] running [[GarageBand]].<ref name="JonesOberlin2018">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oberlin.edu/news/qa-vansire-cofounder-josh-augustin-20|title=Q&A with Vansire Cofounder Josh Augustin ’20|last=Jones|first=Ben|date=7 December 2018|website=Oberlin College and Conservatory|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224080520/https://www.oberlin.edu/news/qa-vansire-cofounder-josh-augustin-20|archive-date=24 February 2020|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref> Augustin and Winemiller, initially unsure of what to call their new project, turned to an online random word generator which landed on "vansire",<ref name="JonesOberlin2018" /> an alternative name for the [[Marsh mongoose]].<ref name="KingdonHappold2013">{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Kingdon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_07noCPc4kC&pg=RA4-PA298|title=Mammals of Africa|author2=David Happold|author3=Thomas Butynski|date=23 May 2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|others=Michael Hoffmann, Meredith Happold, Jan Kalina|isbn=978-1-4081-8996-2|pages=298}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Histoire Naturelle des Mammifères : avec des figures originales, coloriées, dessinées d'aprèsdes animaux vivans.

From there, the two continued to record together in their basements, living rooms, and bedrooms under the new Vansire moniker.

=== ''Reflections and Reveries'' and ''The Rolling, Driftless North'' (2016 - 2017) ===
In August 2016, Vansire self-released their first album, ''Reflections and Reveries''. The duo recorded the album entirely in Winemiller's basement in a roughly one-year period from August 2015 to August 2016, and included Winemiller's brother, Issac, on bass for some songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vansire.bandcamp.com/album/reflections-and-reveries|title=Reflections and Reveries - Vansire|website=Bandcamp|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/02/vansire-chester-watson-star-catcher|title=Vansire and Chester Watson Blend Dream Pop and Hip-Hop "Star Catcher"|last=Corrigan|first=Graham|date=2 February 2018|website=Complex|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>

During this time, Augustin began studying at the [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]] and [[Oberlin College]], while Winemiller started at the [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.krtuindie.org/blog/2018/12/3/qampa-josh-augustin|title=Q&A: Josh Augustin of Vansire|last=Anthony|first=Dominic|date=3 December 2018|website=KRTU Indie|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retriever.umbc.edu/2019/08/vansire-woos-crowd-with-dream-pop-performance-at-songbyrd/|title=Vansire woos crowd with dream-pop performance at Songbyrd|last=Dassarma|first=Anjali|date=27 August 2019|website=The Retriever|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327211414/https://retriever.umbc.edu/2019/08/vansire-woos-crowd-with-dream-pop-performance-at-songbyrd/|archive-date=27 March 2020|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> Despite the distance, the duo vowed to remain committed to the Vansire project, now describing it as "a long-distance band relationship."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fordhamram.com/62323/culture/vansire-sets-the-bar-high-for-dream-pop-soundtrack-of-the-summer/|title=Vansire Sets High Bar for Dream Pop Soundtrack of the Summer|last=Nangle|first=Olivia|date=25 April 2018|website=The Fordham Ram|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327211421/https://fordhamram.com/62323/culture/vansire-sets-the-bar-high-for-dream-pop-soundtrack-of-the-summer/|archive-date=27 March 2020|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>

===''Angel Youth'' and ''After Fillmore County'' (2018 - present)===

Vansire released their second album ''Angel Youth'' in April 2018 on Spirit Goth Records. Augustin and Winemiller produced and mastered the album themselves,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/78021/Vansire-Angel-Youth/|title=Review: Angel Youth - Vansire|last=K.|first=Rudy|date=27 September 2018|website=Sputnikmusic|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710223723/https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/78021/Vansire-Angel-Youth/|archive-date=10 July 2019|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> and it is the band's first full length album that featured collaborations with other artists.

In June 2019, the duo released their single "Metamodernity",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atwoodmagazine.com/vsmm-vansire-metamodernity-song-review/|title=TODAY’S SONG: VANSIRE MUSE ABOUT MODERN LIFE WITH "METAMODERNITY"|last=Vettorino|first=Madison|date=19 August 2019|website=Atwood Magazine|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> also recording an [[Audiotree]] Live session at Audiotree's studios in Chicago later that August.<ref name="VansireAudioTree" />

In July 2020, Vansire released "Central Time", a single featuring Chicago-based rapper [[Mick Jenkins (rapper)|Mick Jenkins]] in their first collaboration together. In an interview announcing the single, Augustin said the single began as an instrumental demo that Winemiller sent him in September 2019, which sat untouched for roughly eight months until the duo returned back to it, finishing it up in the beginning of June 2020.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Vettorino|first=Madison|date=21 July 2020|title=PREMIERE: VANSIRE & MICK JENKINS’ “CENTRAL TIME” IS A LOVE LETTER FOR THE MIDWEST|url=https://atwoodmagazine.com/vsct-vansire-central-time-song-premiere/|website=Atwood Magazine}}</ref>

During this period of the band's history, Augustin said that Vansire found itself leaning in an "increasingly dance-oriented direction" with regard to musical sound, and that the duo has started to draw influence from more "dancey, funk-imbued music".<ref name=":0" />

On October 16, 2020, Vansire released ''After Fillmore County'', a seven song EP which brought back FLOOR CRY, and featured Philadelphia-based rapper [[Ivy Sole]].

In April 2021, Vansire released a remix of Sydney-based producer-artist Swaine Delgado's ''F Me Up'', their first remix.
