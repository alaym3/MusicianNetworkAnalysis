In 2011, Bergling's track "[[Fade into Darkness]]" was sampled by [[Leona Lewis]] on her single "[[Collide (Leona Lewis and Avicii song)|Collide]]". The sampling was not accredited and led to controversy as Bergling attempted to block the single's release.

=== Musical style ===
Bergling's early work was [[deep house]] and [[progressive house]], usually based on a four-chord structure, sub-bass and a simple synth melody.<ref name="Avicii obituary" /> His debut studio album ''True'' featured a blending of music genres, including [[folktronica]].<ref name="variety">{{Cite news |url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/avicii-appreciation-tribute-death-edm-pop-music-1202776287/ |title=Remembering Avicii, the Pop Innovator Who Led EDM Into the Mainstream |last=Blacklow |first=Jeremy |date=21 April 2018|work=Variety}}</ref> While making the album, Bergling wanted to fuse the electronic music genre with soul, funk, blues, folk and country, as he felt that EDM had become too focused on "dirty drops".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2013/08/14/avicii-and-the-ever-changing-definition-of-edm |title=Avicii And The Ever-Changing Definition of EDM |last=Greenburg |first=Zack O'Malley |date=14 August 2013 |work=Forbes |access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref> Its first single, "Wake Me Up", is a [[folk music]] crossover, which, as noted by ''[[The Observer]]'' writer, "tapped into the market potential of mixing EDM and country, a template many artists have since recreated".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/20/avicii-appreciation-the-poster-boy-for-edm-who-struggled-with-the-spotlight |title=Avicii: the poster boy for EDM who struggled with the spotlight |last=Bain |first=Katie |date=21 April 2018 |work=The Observer |access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref> A ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' editor commented that Bergling's "distinct sound" was comprised by "soaring synths and keening melodies".<ref name="variety" /> Musicians such as [[Kygo]], [[Skrillex]], [[Diplo]], [[Gryffin]], [[Martin Garrix]] and [[Cheat Codes (DJs)|Cheat Codes]] have cited him as a source of inspiration.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8358400/avicii-death-reactions |title=Avicii's Death Mourned by Calvin Harris, Marshmello, deadmau5 & More |last=Marzovilla |first=Julia |date=20 April 2018 |work=Billboard |access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref>

== Philanthropy ==
After achieving widespread commercial success, Bergling began working with his manager and executive producer Ash Pournouri to start [[House for Hunger]] in 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houseforhunger.org/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614120239/http://www.houseforhunger.org/|url-status=dead|title=ターミナリア生活|date=2 August 2018|archive-date=14 June 2012|website=ターミナリア生活}}</ref> a charity dedicated to alleviating global hunger. The pair wanted to showcase the giving spirit fostered by the house music community. Bergling explained, "You have to give something back. I am so fortunate to be in the position where I can actually do that. I feel lucky every day when I wake up and am able to do what I love and make a living." In addition to donating $1 million to Feeding America, a charity founded by [[John van Hengel]], House for Hunger has helped fund the efforts of The Feed Foundation, started by [[Laura Bush]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefeedfoundation.org/ |title=FEED |publisher=FEED Foundation |access-date=12 November 2015}}</ref> allowing it to distribute over 2 million school meals throughout Africa.<ref>{{cite web |last=Amorosi |first=A.D. |title=Avicci: Leading By Example With Charity |url=http://djz.com/news/avicii-leading-by-example-with-charity/?c=y |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130408021959/http://djz.com/news/avicii-leading-by-example-with-charity/?c=y |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 April 2013 |publisher=DJZ.com |date=14 February 2013}}</ref> He also supported campaigns against human trafficking and gang violence when he directed the videos for his tracks "[[For a Better Day]]" and "[[Pure Grinding]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43845137|title=Avicii: The superstar DJ behind some of the decade's biggest hits|date=20 April 2018|first=Ian|last=Youngs|access-date=21 April 2018|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

In January 2012, Bergling was hospitalised for 11 days in New York City with [[acute pancreatitis]] caused by excessive alcohol use.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Bein|first1=Kat|title=Avicii's Health Struggles: A Timeline|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/8358621/avicii-health-timeline|magazine=Billboard|access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref> In 2014, Bergling underwent surgery and had both his appendix and [[gallbladder]] removed.

The documentary depicts the pressure from his management to continue performing live in spite of his objections.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Halperin|first1=Shirley|title='Avicii: True Stories' Documentary Reveals Star DJ's Struggles With Health, Fame and Early Retirement (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/avicii-documentary-true-stories-director-interview-1202553567/|access-date=24 April 2018|work=Variety|date=11 September 2017}}</ref>

High pressure from management and fans to continue touring and maintaining his public persona were cited as key reasons for his suicide, according to ''[[GQ]]''. In a statement from the article, "Bergling feared upsetting fans. He was sensitive to the 'flood of hate mail' after cancelled gigs."<ref name="BritishGQ" />

His manager, [[Arash Pournouri]], admitted that he knew of Bergling's anxieties but refused to label them a problem of mental health. Furthermore, his management team only became aware of his painkiller addiction in November 2014. They staged two interventions for him, neither of which were successful. Pournouri rescheduled many shows in order for Bergling to recover in Stockholm. Having discovered his client's alcohol issues earlier, Pournouri set out to forbid his promoters from offering him alcohol, clearing out his minibar and focusing on his recovery. Problems worsened, however, when there were no crew to "keep tabs" on Bergling during his recuperation.<ref name="BritishGQ">{{Cite web|last=Ralston|first=William|date=25 September 2018|title=Who really killed Avicii?|url=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/who-really-killed-avicii|url-status=live|access-date=27 January 2021|website=[[GQ]]}}</ref>

Against his client's wishes, Pournouri claimed to have cancelled two more world tours, which would have added up to approximately US$2.9 million in profits.<ref name="BritishGQ"/>
