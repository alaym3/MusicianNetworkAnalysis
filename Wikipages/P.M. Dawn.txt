'''P.M. Dawn''' was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] act that formed in 1988 by the brothers [[Attrell Cordes]] (known by his stage name Prince Be, sometimes credited as Prince Be the Nocturnal) and Jarrett Cordes (known as DJ Minutemix) in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book| first= Martin C.| last= Strong| year= 2000| title= The Great Rock Discography| edition= 5th| publisher= Mojo Books| location= Edinburgh| pages= 750–751| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> They earned significant [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success in the early 1990s with music that merged hip hop, older [[soul music|soul]], and more pop-oriented [[urban contemporary|urban R&B]].<ref name="Erlewine"/>

After recording their debut single "Ode to a Forgetful Mind" in 1988, P.M. Dawn released their first album ''[[Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience]]'' in 1991 to critical acclaim. It achieved immediate commercial success because of its single "[[Set Adrift on Memory Bliss]]". Their 1993 follow-up ''[[The Bliss Album...? (Vibrations of Love and Anger and the Ponderance of Life and Existence)]]'' was also praised by critics and featured the hit singles "[[I'd Die Without You]]" and "[[Looking Through Patient Eyes]]". P.M. Dawn continued to receive strong reviews with their subsequent albums ''[[Jesus Wept]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dearest Christian, I'm So Very Sorry for Bringing You Here. Love, Dad]]'' (1998), which sold poorly.<ref name="Erlewine"/>

==Early history==
[[Attrell Cordes]] began DJing parties and composing songs in ninth grade. Cordes, known by his stage name Prince Be, and his younger brother, Jarrett Cordes, known as DJ Minutemix, formed P.M. Dawn in 1988. The group's first demo tape was created using $600 that Prince Be had earned through his job as a night [[security guard]] at a [[homeless shelter]].<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|first=Jon |last=Caramanica |title=Prince Be, Who Infused Rap With Mysticism, Dies at 46 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/20/arts/music/prince-be-who-infused-rap-with-mysticism-dies-at-46.html?_r=0 |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2016-06-19 |access-date=2016-07-09}}</ref>

They first approached [[Tommy Boy Records]], the [[rap music]] subsidiary of [[Warner Brothers]], with their demo, but they were told that they were too much like alternative hip-hoppers [[De La Soul]], and not [[hardcore rap|hardcore]] or ghetto, and were turned away.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Eventually, Warlock, an [[independent record label]], issued a debut single, "Ode to a Forgetful Mind", in 1989, but it went unnoticed.

The [[record label]] that released the single in the United Kingdom, [[Gee Street Records]], found greater success. Gee Street mixed and marketed the song so that it earned considerable attention from music reviewers, and P.M. Dawn found themselves courted not just by Gee Street's head, Jon Baker, but also by most of the major UK record labels. Gee Street brought the brothers to London in 1990 to record tracks for an album; however, the label found itself facing bankruptcy during the recording. The entire Gee Street operation, along with P.M. Dawn's [[recording contract]], was sold to the highest bidder, [[Island Records]]. Island issued a few more singles in the United Kingdom before releasing their debut album, ''[[Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001259/P-M-Dawn.html|title=Musician Guide P.M. Dawn Biography|access-date=January 13, 2009}}</ref>

==Career==
==="Set Adrift on Memory Bliss"===
''Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross'' featured the international hit "[[Set Adrift on Memory Bliss]]", which sampled the [[Spandau Ballet]] song "[[True (Spandau Ballet song)|True]]", and featured a cameo by Spandau Ballet singer [[Tony Hadley]] in the [[music video]] of the song.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> "Set Adrift on Memory Bliss" hit No. 1 the week of November 30, 1991, and is the first No. 1 song on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart following the introduction of [[Nielsen SoundScan]] to the chart. The song also reached No. 3 in the United Kingdom.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> "Paper Doll", which was one of the early singles Island released in the United Kingdom, was released in the US as a follow-up to "Set Adrift on Memory Bliss", and peaked at No. 28 in early 1992.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

With the success of their debut album, the band parted company with their manager Nick Hemmings and embarked on a world tour. During this world tour, Prince Be gave an interview to [[Details (magazine)|''Details'' magazine]] in which he expressed skepticism of rapper [[KRS-One]]'s activism: "KRS-One wants to be a teacher, but a teacher of what?" KRS-One and his crew, [[Boogie Down Productions]], responded by storming a P.M. Dawn concert, forcing the group off the stage and performing their songs "[[By All Means Necessary|I'm Still #1]]" and "[[The Bridge Is Over]]".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crazyhood.com/diggin-files-krs-one-bill-adler/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801095228/http://www.crazyhood.com/diggin-files-krs-one-bill-adler/ |archive-date=2016-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Defending his actions to ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s James T. Jones IV, KRS-One remarked, "I answered his question. 'A teacher of what?' I'm a teacher of respect."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000904/KRS-One.html|publisher=Musician Guide |title=KRS-One Biography|access-date=January 12, 2009}}</ref>

In 1992, P.M. Dawn appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD ''[[Red Hot + Dance]]'', contributing the Richie Rich Mix of "Set Adrift on Memory Bliss".<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=959/60}}</ref> The album, featuring [[George Michael]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] among others, was meant to raise money and awareness in support of the AIDS epidemic.

===''The Bliss Album...?''===
Before releasing their follow-up album, ''[[The Bliss Album...? (Vibrations of Love and Anger and the Ponderance of Life and Existence)]]'', P.M. Dawn contributed the single "[[I'd Die Without You]]" to the 1992 [[Eddie Murphy]] comedy ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]'' and [[Boomerang (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]]. This #3 pop hit was also included on ''The Bliss Album...?'', as was the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' #6 pop hit "[[Looking Through Patient Eyes]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

"Looking Through Patient Eyes" featured backing vocals by [[Cathy Dennis]] and sampled [[George Michael]]'s hit "[[Father Figure (George Michael song)|Father Figure]]". The [[music video]] for the song was shot in a church, and featured [[Christianity|Christian]] images throughout — most notably, Prince Be wore a [[T-shirt]] with "Thank you, Jesus" written across it in black lettering.

''The Bliss Album...?'' featured a duet with [[Boy George]] entitled "More Than Likely" and a cover of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The album also included "So On and So On," which led to a 1999 [[sampling (music)|sampling]] lawsuit. In the lawsuit ''Batiste v. Island Records, Inc.'', Paul and Michael Batiste claimed that P.M. Dawn's song "So On and So On" used unauthorized samples from David Batiste & The Gladiators' "Funky Soul". The fifth Circuit Federal [[Appellate Court]] found that the Batistes point to no evidence in the record demonstrating that consumers were confused or deceived by either the use of a digital sample of "Funky Soul" in "So On and So On", or the attribution to David Batiste as a co-author of the track. The Batistes' claim that Paul and Michael Batiste were improperly excluded from the [[liner notes]] accompanying the album also failed to suggest that consumers were confused, especially because the liner notes do credit the name of the band in which both Paul and Michael Batiste performed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/179/217/546551/|title=United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. - 179 F.3d 217 |date= June 21, 1999}}</ref> Though Island Records won the lawsuit, the song was removed from subsequent releases of ''The Bliss Album'' and is no longer available for purchase in their publishing catalog.

===''Jesus Wept'' and DJ Minutemix's arrest to present===
P.M. Dawn contributed a cover of "You Got Me Floatin'" to the 1993 [[compilation album]] ''[[Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''. Artists ranging from [[Pat Metheny]] to [[Eric Clapton]] to [[Ice-T]]'s [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]] were included. They also remixed [[Beautiful People (band)|Beautiful People]]'s "[[If 60's Was 90's]]".

Their 1995 album ''[[Jesus Wept]]'' was unable to attain the success of their first two albums. The album's highest charting single was "[[Downtown Venus]]", which contained a sample of [[Deep Purple]]'s "Hush", and reached #48 on the ''Billboard'' chart.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  Also, in 1995, P.M. Dawn was credited with the [[remix]] of [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]'s "Blood, Milk and Sky" (Miss September Mix) on the ''Supersexy Swingin' Sounds'' compilation album. In 1996, P.M. Dawn contributed "Non-Fiction Burning" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Rio]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].<ref name="Larkin"/> In 1998, Prince Be contributed the tracks "Perfect for You" and "Gotta Be...Movin' on Up" to the [[Marlon Wayans]] and [[David Spade]] comedy ''[[Senseless]]'', followed later in the year by P.M. Dawn's fourth album, ''[[Dearest Christian, I'm So Very Sorry for Bringing You Here. Love, Dad]]''. It was less successful again, with the album's single, "Being So Not for You (I Had No Right)" being a minor chart hit.<ref name="biography.jrank.org">{{cite web|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2874/P-M-Dawn.html|title=P.M. Dawn Biography - Selected works|website=biography.jrank.org|access-date=2016-05-27}}</ref>

In the same year, Jarret Cordes (DJ Minutemix) was accused of sexually abusing a 14-year old relative and was subsequently arrested in Burlington County. The girl is said to have been a first cousin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1995-09-22/news/25719265_1_raymond-second-degree-charge-burlington-county-prosecutor-s-office|title=Pop Singer Accused Of Sex With Kin Jarrett Cordes, Of The Hip-hop Duo P.m. Dawn, Is Charged With Assaults On A 14-year-old Relative.|website=philly-archives|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref>

In 2000, they released the compilation, ''[[The Best of P.M. Dawn]]''. Through their website, they also began selling a mail-order-only album called ''Fucked Music'' on December 1, 2000. This was paired with a bonus CD, ''Unreleased Vol. 1'', and a T-shirt.

Prince Be suffered a massive [[stroke]] in early 2005 that left him paralyzed on the left side of his body. Undeterred, P.M. Dawn appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me, Baby, One More Time]]'', performing "Set Adrift on Memory Bliss", and covered [[Puddle of Mudd]]'s "[[Blurry]]". Despite the fact that Prince Be was still suffering the effects of this stroke, they beat [[Animotion]], [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]], [[Juice Newton]] and [[Shannon (American singer)|Shannon]] to claim the $20,000 charitable prize, which they contributed to the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]], as Prince Be was a diabetic.

Following their appearance on ''Hit Me, Baby, One More Time'', Minutemix was terminated for sexual misconduct. This led to the introduction of the Cordes brothers' paternal first cousin, Gregory Lewis Carr II, known by his stage name Doc. G (also known as 'Dr. Giggles').<ref>{{cite web|last=Meyer |first=Marianne|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/29/AR2007082901138.html|title=Live!|access-date=2015-03-13|work = The Washington Post}}</ref>

Doc. G continues to perform and record music under the P.M. Dawn name. On April 6, 2018, Doc.G announced K-R.O.K. as a new member of P.M. Dawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/OfficialPMDawn/photos/a.10151935971420924.1073741826.311949565923/10155366721035924 |title=P.M.

On June 17, 2016, Attrell Cordes, known within the group as Prince Be, died of [[Kidney disease|renal disease]], caused by complications of diabetes, at the age of 46 at a hospital in [[Neptune City, New Jersey]].<ref name=nytimes/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2016/06/17/pm-dawn-prince-be-dead/ |title=P.M.
