'''Blind Faith''' were an English [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] featuring [[Steve Winwood]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ginger Baker]], and [[Ric Grech]]. They were eagerly anticipated by the music press following on the success of each of the member's former bands, including Clapton and Baker's former group [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and Winwood's former group [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], but they split after only a few months, producing only one album and a three-month long summer tour.

The group originated with informal jamming by Clapton and Winwood in early 1969 following the break-ups of Cream and Traffic. Baker joined them in rehearsals and they decided to form a group. Grech joined as the fourth member from the band [[Family (band)|Family]] in May, and they began recording their [[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|eponymous debut album]]. It drew controversy for featuring a photograph of a topless 11-year-old girl on the front cover, and it was issued with a different cover in the United States.

The first Blind Faith concert was on 7 June in front of an estimated 100,000 fans in [[Hyde Park, London]], but they felt that they had not rehearsed enough and were unprepared. They subsequently played concerts in Scandinavia and the US, but the lack of material in the live set led them to play old Cream and Traffic songs which pleased the audience but disillusioned the band. Clapton became increasingly isolated during the tour, preferring to spend time with support act [[Delaney & Bonnie]], and Blind Faith disbanded immediately after their last performance. Clapton and Winwood both enjoyed the music that they played together in the group's limited time, and they have since collaborated on several tours playing Blind Faith material.

== Formation and early history ==
The origins of Blind Faith lay in the break-up of [[Cream (band)|Cream]], in mid-1968. That group had become a major critical and commercial success, selling millions of records within a few years and bringing international popularity to both the group and each individual member. Despite that success, the band was crumbling from within because of frequent animosity between bassist [[Jack Bruce]] and drummer [[Ginger Baker]], with [[Eric Clapton]] doing his best to mediate. In addition, Clapton became tired of playing commercially-driven [[blues]] and hoped to move forward with a new, experimental, less straitjacketed approach to the genre.<ref name=llm>{{cite web|url=https://liveforlivemusic.com/features/blind-faith-rise-fall-supergroup/|title=Blind Faith: The Meteoric Rise & Rapid Fall Of Clapton, Baker, Winwood, And Grech's 1969 Super-Group|work=Live for Live Music|date=16 August 2017|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> The group disbanded in November 1968 following two concerts at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref name=black/>

Steve Winwood had faced similar problems to Clapton in [[The Spencer Davis Group]], where he had been the [[lead singer]] for three years. Winwood wanted to experiment with the band's sound by infusing [[jazz]] elements, but left due to his musical differences, instead forming a new band, [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], in 1967. While that band was on hiatus in Christmas 1968, Winwood started to [[jam (music)|jam]] with his good friend Clapton in the latter's basement in [[Surrey]], England.<ref name=black/>{{sfn|Welch|2016|pp=120,125}}{{efn|Clapton and Winwood had previously collaborated on the "[[Eric Clapton's Powerhouse|Powerhouse]]" project,<ref name=llm/> and Clapton had joined the Spencer Davis Group onstage at [[The Marquee]] club in London.<ref name=black/>}} Clapton was pleased with the jam sessions with Winwood, but was hesitant to start a serious group.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=120}} The music press were hopeful that Clapton would form a band even better than Cream. At one point, Clapton and Winwood thought they might record with [[Duck Dunn]] and [[Al Jackson Jr.]], the rhythm section of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]].{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=126}}

In early 1969, Clapton and Winwood moved to Traffic's rehearsal cottage in [[Aston Tirrold]], [[Berkshire]].<ref name=black/> Baker turned up one day to sit in with them, and the three seriously considered forming a group.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=127}} Clapton questioned letting Baker in the band, because he had promised Bruce that, if they were to work with one another again, all three of them would play. Moreover, Clapton didn't want to reunite with Cream barely nine weeks after the break-up, and also didn't want to deal with another band whose members had large reputations individually. Winwood ultimately persuaded Clapton to finalize Baker's inclusion in the line-up, arguing that Baker strengthened their musicianship and that it would be hard to find an equally talented drummer.{{sfn|Clapton|2007|pp=108–110}} Traffic was put on hold and the other remaining members, multi-instrumentalist [[Chris Wood (rock musician)|Chris Wood]] and drummer / singer [[Jim Capaldi]], were informed. Winwood later realised that Clapton would probably have rather had Capaldi in the new group instead of Baker.<ref name=black/>

Clapton and Winwood's respective managers, [[Robert Stigwood]] and [[Chris Blackwell]], said they would be happy to manage the new band. This created immediate tension; Stigwood wanted a quick money-making formula while the band wanted time to write songs and develop as a unit. Winwood later said, "they wanted a supergroup and we didn't".<ref name=black>{{cite magazine|title=Born Under A Bad Sign|first=Johnny|last=Black|magazine=Mojo|date=June 1996|pages=47–52|url=http://www.gingerbaker.com/bands/blind-faith.htm}}</ref>

The formation of the group was announced to the press on 8 February 1969.<ref name=llm/> By May, Ric Grech, bassist with [[Family (band)|Family]], was invited to join them. He left Family midway through a US tour, causing considerable acrimony with the rest of the group.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=127}}<ref name=black/> The new band's name was confirmed as "Blind Faith" around this time by Clapton, who thought it described everyone's self-belief that the band would be successful, no matter what happened.{{sfn|Bowling|2013|p=109}}<ref name=black/>

Because Winwood was signed to [[Island Records]], he had to obtain permission from Blackwell (who owned the label) to appear on [[Polydor Records]] (to whom Clapton and Baker were signed in the U.K.).{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=128}} A promotional single was released by Island, although the promotion was for the label itself. It was a single announcing the fact that they were moving their offices, titled "Change Of Address From 23 June 1969". This one-sided promo featured an instrumental jam by Blind Faith, who were not mentioned on the label (the only other label info is the new address, phone number, and new cable address of Island).<ref name=coa>{{cite AV media notes|title=Change of Address from 23 June 1969|publisher=Island Records|url=https://www.discogs.com/Blind-Faith-Change-Of-Address-From-June-23rd-1969/release/3144647}}</ref> Recorded at Olympic Studios during session for the debut album, an estimated 500 copies of the single were pressed, and mostly sent to UK disc jockeys and other music industry insiders. The track was finally released widely when it appeared as a bonus track on the two-CD "Deluxe Edition" of the ''Blind Faith'' album in 2000 (titled "Change Of Address Jam").{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=123}}

Upon its release in July 1969, the band's first and only album ''[[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|Blind Faith]]'' topped both the UK chart and [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'']]'s chart for Pop Album in the U.S.<ref name=crr>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockreview.com/2014/01/1969-blind-faith/|title=Blind Faith|publisher=Classic Rock Review|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref> The album sold more than half a million copies in the first month of its release<ref name=crr/> and helped rejuvenate sales of Cream albums. ''[[Best of Cream]]'' reached No.&nbsp;3 in the ''Billboard'' charts at the same time that ''Blind Faith'' was at the top.{{sfn|Bowling|2013|p=112}}

The cover art for the album was created by photographer [[Bob Seidemann]],{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=129}} a personal friend and former flatmate of Clapton, who is known primarily for his photos of [[Janis Joplin]] and the [[Grateful Dead]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/us/bob-seidemann-photographer-dies.html|title=Bob Seidemann, 75, Photographer of Rock Stars and Aviators, Dies|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 December 2017|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> The cover was nameless – only the wrapping paper told the buyer who the artist was and the name of the album. It provoked controversy because it featured a topless 11-year-old girl, holding in her hands a silver [[Spacecraft|space ship]]. The US record company issued it with an alternative cover with a photograph of the band on the front. The model on the cover posed upon consent by her parents and was paid £40 (£{{inflation|UK|40|1969}} as of {{inflation-year|UK}}) for the shot.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=129}}{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=133}}

During 2000 the entire album was remastered and re-released as a two-CD deluxe edition from Polydor that includes alternative takes, out-takes and studio rehearsal versions of the band's music created during the early months of 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/blind-faith-2000-deluxe-edition-mr0001203942|title=Blind Faith (2000 Deluxe Edition)|website=AllMusic|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref>

== Touring ==
News of Blind Faith's formation created a buzz of excitement among the public and press. The group debuted at a free concert at [[London]]'s [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 7 June 1969 in front of 100,000 fans.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=132}} Capaldi and Wood attended the gig, as did [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Marianne Faithfull]].<ref name=black/> The setlist contained all six numbers that would appear on the debut album, along with a cover of [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[Under My Thumb]]", Traffic's "Means to an End", and [[Sam Myers]]' "Sleeping in the Ground".{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=124}} The performance was well received by fans, but troubled Clapton, who thought that the band's playing was sub-par.{{sfn|Clapton|2007|p=111}} He spent much of the gig close to his amplifiers and not coming forward on stage; only Baker supplied any showmanship and theatrics during the set.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=132}}

Though the group were still developing, their management insisted they continue touring to provide income.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=133}} Clapton, knowing the band had not rehearsed enough and was unprepared, was reluctant to tour, but agreed to do so because he could collaborate with Winwood and had no better work offers.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=127}} The recording of their album continued, followed by a short tour of [[Scandinavia]], where the band played smaller gigs and was able to rehearse their sound and prepare it for bigger audiences in the US and UK. After Scandinavia, the band toured the United States, making their debut at [[Madison Square Garden]] on 12 July.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=133}}

A major problem with the tour was that the band had only a few songs in their catalogue, barely enough to fill an hour, which the audience did not know well.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=137}} Clapton in particular was against any lengthy jamming, which had been Cream's trademark, which would have allowed them to stretch out a set to a sufficient length.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=127}} The group were forced to play old Cream and Traffic songs, to the delight of a crowd which usually preferred the old hits to the new Blind Faith material. Clapton resented being in a popular supergroup when he had intended to start a more low-key project. They were playing the same material from his Cream days, to appease the audience and to fill the void left by the lack of adequate new material.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=133}} Clapton wanted to play the [[Woodstock Festival]], which occurred during the tour, but was outvoted by the rest of the group.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=139}}

The tour was supported by opening acts [[Free (band)|Free]], [[Taste (Irish band)|Taste]], and R&B-based rock act [[Delaney & Bonnie]]. Because Clapton liked the soulful, folksy-sounding blues of Delaney & Bonnie, he began spending most of his time with them instead of Blind Faith,{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=133}} letting Winwood take a more prominent role in the band.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=127}} Clapton even began sitting in on Delaney & Bonnie's opening sets, sometimes simply playing percussion, and showing more interest in them than his own band. He also wanted them to be the headliners instead of Blind Faith.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=140}}

The band toured for seven more weeks in the US, finishing in [[Hawaii]] on 24 August.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=141}}<ref name=black/> After the gig, Clapton and Winwood decided to end the group. Grech was immediately informed, but Baker did not find out until he had returned to England following a short holiday in [[Jamaica]]. When he finally got home to the UK, he met with Winwood and was upset to find that the band had disbanded.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=141}}

== Aftermath ==
After the tour finished in August, various press reports speculated on future band activity, with Stigwood announcing that there would be further tours forthcoming.<ref name=black/> In October, the band issued a press release saying they had disbanded.<ref name=llm/> There was no further activity from the group, though several tracks from the band can be found on Steve Winwood's 1995 retrospective album ''[[The Finer Things]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-finer-things-mw0000124006|title=The Finer Things|website=AllMusic|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref> In 2005, the live album ''[[London Hyde Park 1969]]'' was released, documenting the entire concert at the park.<ref name=hp69>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=london-hyde-park-1969-mw0001448683|pure_url=yes}} |title=London Hyde Park 1969 |website=[[AllMusic]] |last=Adams |first=Bret |access-date=8 September 2018}}</ref>

Clapton had mixed feelings about ending the group, and felt guilty about abandoning a project that Winwood had put more involvement into than himself. He stepped out of the spotlight, first to sit in with the [[Plastic Ono Band]],{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=131}} and then to tour as a [[sideman]] for [[Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]]. This freed him of the limelight that he had considered a plague to both Cream and Blind Faith.{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=141}} After his sideman stint, he took several members from Delaney & Bonnie to form a new super-group, [[Derek and the Dominos]].{{sfn|Welch|2016|p=148}} He never dropped his Blind Faith repertoire completely, as "Presence of the Lord" and "[[Can't Find My Way Home]]" have been performed occasionally throughout his solo career.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=129}}{{sfn|Bowling|2013|p=111}}

Unlike Clapton, Baker had enjoyed his Blind Faith experience and looked to carry on an offshoot of the band in the form of [[Ginger Baker's Air Force]] with both Grech and Winwood.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=135}} After a few shows together, Winwood left to record a solo album ''Mad Shadows'', which turned into the Traffic album ''[[John Barleycorn Must Die]]''.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|pp=137–8}} Clapton turned up backstage to a Traffic gig in 1970 and played dual lead guitar with Winwood on "[[Dear Mr. Fantasy]]", fuelling rumours of a reunion of the pair.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=139}} Grech joined Traffic's touring band after the album was released, and played on the Traffic albums ''[[The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys]]'' and ''[[Welcome to the Canteen]]''.{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2018|p=143}} Winwood would later go on to have a successful solo career, and Grech was a member of various groups before his death in 1990.<ref name=black/> Baker died on 6 October 2019, leaving Winwood and Clapton as the only two surviving members of Blind Faith.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49827436|title=Cream drummer Ginger Baker dies aged 80|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=6 October 2019|access-date=6 October 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

== Clapton and Winwood reunions ==
Clapton and Winwood performed together again on stage as part of the Action for Research into Multiple Sclerosis (ARMS) tour in 1983. The shows were a benefit for former [[Small Faces]] and [[Faces (band)|Faces]] member [[Ronnie Lane]], who was suffering from the syndrome.{{sfn|Welch|2016|pp=192–193}}

In July 2007, Clapton and Winwood reunited for a performance during the second [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] held at the [[Toyota Park (Bridgeview)|Toyota Park Center]] of [[Bridgeview]] ([[Illinois]]), where the duo performed a number of Blind Faith songs as part of their set. That performance inspired the two to perform three reunion concerts at Madison Square Garden that took place on 25, 26 and 28 February 2008. It was not an official Blind Faith reunion, but simply "Winwood and Clapton". They performed the four songs on the first side of ''Blind Faith'' as well as selections from Traffic, Derek and the Dominos, Clapton's solo career and some covers.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/clapton-and-winwood-break-out-blind-faith-hendrix-at-first-supergig-89216/|title=Clapton and Winwood break out Blind Faith and Hendrix at first Supergig|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=26 February 2008|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> A [[Live from Madison Square Garden (Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood album)|DVD and a two-disc CD]] of these performances was released in 2009.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1540049|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine}}</ref>

On 10 June 2009, Winwood and Clapton began a 14-date United States [[summer]] tour at the [[Izod Center]] in [[New Jersey]], again including Blind Faith material in their setlist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/review/268387/eric-clapton-steve-winwood-june-10-2009-east-rutherford-nj-izod-center|title=Eric Clapton & Steve Winwood / June 10, 2009 / East Rutherford, NJ (IZOD Center)|work=Billboard|date=11 June 2009|access-date=16 February 2019}}</ref> Winwood and Clapton met again for a series of five concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] from 26 May to 1 June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whereseric.com/eric-clapton-news/303-clapton-royal-albert-hall-2011-dust-begins|title=Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall: The 2011 "Dust Up" Begins|publisher=Where's Eric|date=18 May 2011|access-date=16 February 2019}}</ref> Clapton and Winwood both returned to play Hyde Park on 8 July 2018, though they performed separately.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jambase.com/article/eric-clapton-team-santana-steve-winwood-gary-clark-jr-london|title=Eric Clapton To Team With Santana, Steve Winwood & Gary Clark Jr. In London|work=Jambase|date=27 November 2017|access-date=16 February 2019}}</ref>
