==Life and career==

===Beginnings, Banda Eva and early solo career===
Ivete Sangalo was born in [[Juazeiro]], Bahia, where she spent her childhood.  She is of paternal [[Spanish immigration to Brazil|Spanish]] descent (her grandfather was born in Spain).<ref>[http://www.elcorreogallego.es/santiago/ecg/cantante-brasilena-ivete-sangalo-saca-primera-vez-un-disco-mercado-espanol/idEdicion-2006-06-03/idNoticia-51316/ La cantante brasileña Ivete Sangalo saca por primera vez un disco en el mercado español] (Spanish interview)"Porque mi abuelo era español y mi padre me hablaba siempre de España". - '''"My grandfather is Spanish and my father always spoke about Spain"'''</ref><ref>[http://www.opovo.com.br/opovo/buchicho/682371.html Her father is of Spanish descent] "Meu pai é descendente de espanhóis".</ref>
She started her singing career in events at school and then started singing at bars. She started to receive attention and signed with [[Sony Music]]. In 1993, Sony decided to reform the [[Axé]] group Banda Eva and she was chosen as the lead singer. Her live album with the band, ''Banda Eva Ao Vivo'', was their best-selling album, selling over a million copies. In 1997 she started a solo career and in 1999 she released her first album. With many upbeat Bahian rhythms and axé, the album received [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] and [[Music recording sales certification|platinum certification]]. The following year she released, ''Beat Beleza'', which also achieved platinum status.

In 2000 she released the album ''Festa'', whose title track was another success. The single was very popular, and the album got platinum certification. "Festa" was her biggest single up to that point and the video received huge airplay. "Festa" was the most popular song of 2001 in Brazil. Its music video featured 20 cameo appearances by Brazilian celebrities. In 2002, she released the album ''Se Eu Não te Amasse Tanto Assim'' (If I Didn't Love You So Much), titled after her big hit that reached the first position in the singles chart. The album, which features a duet with American singer [[Brian McKnight]], didn't sell as much as her previous albums, but was still a hit. Following ''Se Eu Não te Amasse Tanto Assim'', she released ''Clube Carnavalesco Innocentes Em Progresso'' in 2003. It was the lowest-selling solo album of her career but it still managed to receive gold certification.

===2003–08: Career consolidation===
[[File:Sangalo 2004.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Sangalo in 2004.]]
MTV Ao Vivo Ivete Sangalo MTV Live: Ivete Sangalo (2004), was a live album and included her biggest hits, few released on a live album before, and some Banda Eva hits. The album earned huge sales, most of them because of the single "Sorte Grande", which was renamed "Poeira" by the public and became a big hit in parties, on the radio and also at soccer stadiums (where it was used to cheer the soccer teams). The song received heavy airplay in Brazil and it was also included in the soundtrack of [[Fifa 2005]] videogame. The album received diamond certification and was the second best-selling album of 2004. The DVD, which included the concert held at the [[Estádio Fonte Nova|Fonte Nova stadium]], was certified 3x [[Music recording sales certification|Diamond]], sold over 600,000 copies, and is the best-selling musical DVD in Brazil of all time (and the best-selling musical DVD in the world in the second half of 2005).

In 2005, Sangalo was called by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'': Brazil's Queen Song, due to the release of their first live DVD ''"MTV Ao Vivo"'' released at that time, the album made references to [[Carmen Miranda]] in one of his tracks, Miranda lived in the [[United States]] during the first half of the 20th century and epitomized Latin sensuality through her numerous [[Hollywood films]]. Asked if she intends to repeat Miranda's success, Sangalo said, "It would be too pretentious for me to even dream about that parallel. But I would like to follow [in] the steps of [[Tom Jobim]] and [[Caetano Veloso]]. They are Brazilian artists who are respected all around the world. For me, that will be more difficult to achieve, because I want to be known for the kind of music I sing-[which] doesn't fit the Brazilian standards foreign audiences are used to. I want people to [respect] my musical style."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OhAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28 ''Sangalo: Brazil's Queen Of Song'']</ref>

Her 2005 album, ''As Supernovas'', received triple platinum certification shortly after its release.  The album was less upbeat than the others and included some songs with a 1970s touch, with the big influence of Brazilian singer [[Ed Motta]]. She also included the hit "Soy Loco por ti America", a [[Gilberto Gil]] song.  Sangalo's cover would become the theme song of [[TV Globo]]'s soap opera [[América (telenovela)|América]], and thanks to the tie-in, the song became very popular. "Quando a Chuva Passar"  was notable for being nominated at the [[Latin Grammy Awards]], an uncommon feature for a non-Spanish-speaking singer. ''As Supernovas'' also received diamond certification which consolidated her as the biggest female solo singer in Brazil.

Due to her remarkable appearances on TV, [[TV Globo]], the biggest Brazilian TV station, invited her to host the TV show Estação Globo, which aires about six episodes every year in late December/early January.

She was the first Brazilian act to perform in this stadium since pop phenomenon [[Sandy & Junior]] in 2002. The concert was released as a DVD in May 2007. While her last live DVD was an MTV Ao Vivo, this new one was from the Multishow Ao Vivo brand.

Her biggest career hits were "Sorte Grande" (which was renamed "Poeira" and was sung by crowds at soccer games) and "Festa".<ref>[http://www.diariopopular.com.br/28_05_06/estilopag0801.html Sangalo's music in World cup] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070823132237/http://www.diariopopular.com.br/28_05_06/estilopag0801.html |date=August 23, 2007 }}</ref>
