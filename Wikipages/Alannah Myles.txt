The song was a top-ten hit in Canada; it was also a number one hit on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1990.

== Early life ==
Myles was born '''Alannah Byles''' on Christmas Day 1955 in [[Toronto, Ontario]]. She is the daughter of William Douglas Byles, who was a pioneer in the Canadian broadcasting industry and was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters' Hall of Fame in 1997. Raised by her parents in Ontario, Myles spent her childhood composing and learning music. Myles began writing songs around age 9, and performed in a songwriting group for the Kiwanis Music Festival in Toronto at age 12.

==Career==
At the age of 18, she began performing solo gigs in [[southern Ontario]], eventually meeting [[Christopher Ward (songwriter)|Christopher Ward]], a recording artist and songwriter with [[Warner Music Group]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> With Ward's help, she formed her own band and performed cover versions of rock and blues songs, while polishing her own material.

Myles changed her surname from Byles at the age of 19, after deciding to pursue a career in entertainment. Appearances in TV commercials paid for music demos that led to numerous rejections in Canada, until she recorded masters for three songs; "Who Loves You" and a video demo for "Just One Kiss", directed by photographer Deborah Samuel.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> With matched financing from her songwriting collaborator, [[MuchMusic]] ([[City TV]]) and program director Christopher Ward, she signed her first record contract with Atlantic Records in 1987.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

In her mid-20s, Myles and Ward collaborated with [[David Tyson]] to produce her debut album, ''Alannah Myles''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> She appeared in a 1984 episode of the television series ''[[The Kids of Degrassi Street]]'', in which she played the role of an aspiring singer and single mother and was featured in several TV and film productions as a guest host and actor prior to becoming a recording artist.<ref>{{Citation|last=degrassi tng|title=the kids of degrassi street s01e11 catherine finds her balance 001|date=2017-05-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc6dBzYmaDg&t=259|access-date=2017-07-22}}</ref>

Myles was a candidate to be the original host of [[FashionTelevision]], as shared by [[Jeanne Beker]] on the ''Reinvention of the VJ'' podcast, hosted by [[Erica Ehm]]. Beker suggested that Ward was lobbying for Myles to get the role on the new TV program. Beker would eventually become the program's first host.<ref>[https://www.ericaehm.com/reinvention-of-the-vj/2020/11/6/jeannie-beker "Reinvention of the VJ - Episode 3"].  - Spring 2021, Ericaemh.com</ref>

In late 1987, Warner Music Canada's director of [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R), Bob Roper, sent Myles's three-song video package to all of [[Warner Music Group]]'s U.S. affiliates, which garnered a contract for seven or eight years from Atlantic Records (WMG), given by head of A&R Tunc Erim and Atlantic label founder [[Ahmet Ertegun]]. Myles left her acting career, co-wrote and recorded the remainder of her first album with Christopher Ward and producer [[David Tyson]]. In 1989, Atlantic Records released her [[Alannah Myles (album)|eponymous debut album]], and Myles toured internationally for 18 months.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Her first album was awarded the Diamond Award for sales of over one million units; she is the only Canadian debut artist to attain that award. Her first album was reported to have sold more than six million copies internationally.

In May 1989, Warner Music in Canada released ''Alannah Myles'',<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=4952& "RPM Top 100 Albums"]. ''RPM Magazine'' Volume 50, No. 24 October 14, 1989,</ref> which produced four [[Top 40]] hits, including "[[Love Is (Alannah Myles song)|Love Is]]", "Lover Of Mine", "Still Got This Thing" and her number-one classic rock hit, "[[Black Velvet (song)|Black Velvet]]".<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.6585&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.6585.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.6585 "Top Singles"]. ''RPM'', - Volume 50, No. 23 Oct 02, 1989</ref> Atlantic Records' 1989 debut album release was ineligible for Grammy nominations until the early 1990 U.S. single release "Black Velvet" became a number-one hit, claiming ASCAP's most played song on radio for 1989 and 1990. By 2000, it had received ASCAP Millionaire Award for over five million radio airplays.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} "Black Velvet" won Myles the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Performance in 1991 and three [[Juno Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Crenna|first=Carol|url=http://www.vistamagonline.com/vista_articles/page.php?tp=&p=&id=&s=meaning_of_success_canadian_singer_alannah_myles|title=Meaning of Success: Canadian Singer Alannah Myles|publisher= Vista Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426042526/http://www.vistamagonline.com/vista_articles/page.php?tp=&p=&id=&s=meaning_of_success_canadian_singer_alannah_myles|archive-date= 2009-04-26|access-date=2011-08-31}}</ref>

In 1992, Myles was nominated for a second Grammy award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the track "Rockinghorse", the B-side of "[[Song Instead of a Kiss]]", the lead-off single from her second CD ''[[Rockinghorse]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> "Song Instead Of a Kiss", written and composed by Myles, Nancy Simmonds, and Canadian poet [[Robert Priest]],<ref>{{cite book|first=William H|last=New|year=2002|title=Encyclopedia of literature in Canada|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofli0000unse/page/902 902]|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-0-8020-0761-2|oclc=47689945|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofli0000unse/page/902}}</ref> was a 60-piece orchestrated ballad that reached number one on several radio stations around the globe but was met with little response in America, whose audiences were accustomed to "that slow southern style" of "Black Velvet".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The album, released that year, included the other hit singles "Our World, Our Times", and "Sonny, Say You Will". Myles received a Grammy nomination for ''Rockinghorse'' and several global awards, including a Juno and Much Music's People's Choice Award for "Our World, Our Times".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1991, Myles sang "[[O Canada]]" at a [[Major League Baseball]] game at [[Skydome]] in [[Toronto]]. It was broadcast on [[CBS Sports]].

In 1995, Myles released her final album on Atlantic Records before being released from the label, granting Warner/Atlantic a ''Best Of'' CD after only three records. The ''A-lan-nah'' album,<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=311/2}}</ref> which contained no Top 40 singles, included two tracks which made it into the Top 100, namely "Family Secret" and "Blow Wind, Blow".

In 1997, she terminated her eight-record contract with [[Atlantic Records]] with the help of her then-manager [[Miles Copeland III]], who immediately signed her to his own [[Ark 21 Records]]. On Ark 21, she released ''A Rival'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> which contained the Top 40 hit "Bad 4 You", written and recorded by Myles, [[Desmond Child]], and [[Eric Bazilian]] at Copeland's Castle songwriting retreat at Grand Brassac, France. The ''A Rival'' album agreement with Miles Copeland III, Ark 21 Records was successfully terminated in 2014 with 100% copyright reversions returned to ''Alannah Myles'' by 2015 and re-released on Myles's independently owned label, Fascinate inc.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

After the release of ''A Rival'', Myles released two ''Best Of'' compilations, in 1998 and 2001, and both featuring two new songs, and then left Ark 21 Records. She maintained a low profile for almost a decade but gigged around Canada and Europe during this time. In 2001, Myles duetted with [[Saga (band)|Saga]] frontman Michael Sadler on a cover of [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Kate Bush]]'s "[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]", released as a B-side to the Saga single "Money Talks". In 2004, she released a cover of "[[I Can't Stand The Rain (song)|I Can't Stand The Rain]]", with [[Jeff Healey]] on guitar, for a [[Tina Turner]] tribute album ''What's Love? A Tribute To Tina Turner''.

In February 2005, together with the Swedish band [[Kee Marcello's K2]], Myles participated in the third semi-final of [[Melodifestivalen 2005|Melodifestivalen]], the Swedish national selection for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Their selection, "We Got It All," scored very few points and finished seventh out of eight songs, yet it managed to dominate the leading newspaper and media headlines in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gylleneskor.se/history/logged/mf_year.php?mf_year=2005 |title= Melodifestivalen 2005 – Deltävling 3 (Third Semi-Final)|publisher=Gylleneskor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234925/http://www.gylleneskor.se/history/logged/mf_year.php?mf_year=2005|archive-date=2007-09-27|access-date=2011-08-31}}</ref>

Myles's first new solo release in a decade was an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] Tribute EP, released on [[iTunes]] in August 2007, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Elvis' death. The EP features a re-recording of her signature song "Black Velvet", as well as two new songs. All three of them were later included on her next album.

In April 2008, Myles released her fifth studio album, ''Black Velvet,'' which featured a new recording of her song of the same name, in addition to 10 new studio recordings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/Arts---Life/Fashion/2008-04-19/article-1443194/Alannah-Myles-reclaims-Black-Velvet-with-modern-reworking/1|title=Alannah Myles reclaims 'Black Velvet' with modern reworking|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|newspaper=[[The Telegram]]|date=2008-04-19|access-date=2011-08-31|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120912073024/http://www.thetelegram.com/Arts---Life/Fashion/2008-04-19/article-1443194/Alannah-Myles-reclaims-Black-Velvet-with-modern-reworking/1|archive-date=2012-09-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> Myles financed and co-produced the album.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/Shows/1221254309/ID=1278765249|title=Alannah Myles|author=Evan Solomon|work=CBC News: Sunday Night|publisher=CBC News|date=2008-05-11|access-date=2011-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729030426/http://www.cbc.ca/video|archive-date=July 29, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

In early 2008, Myles released the CD ''Black Velvet'' on Linus Entertainment, which resulted in a staggered release internationally while the indie label merged with Canada's True North Records, followed by a video for the song "Trouble" featuring a jug band performance. "Trouble" was awarded an 'Honourable Mention' as a finalist in the blues category at the 2009 International Songwriting Contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songwritingcompetition.com/previouswinners|title=Previous winners|publisher= International Songwriting Contest|access-date=2011-08-31}}</ref> Myles won the 15th annual USA Songwriting Competition for both Best Rock/Alternative Song as well as grand prize finalist for a selection, written and composed jointly with Nancy Simmonds for her ''Black Velvet'' CD, titled "Give Me Love."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songwriting.net/winners|title= 2010 Results|publisher= USA Songwriting Competition|access-date= 2011-08-31| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724073655/http://www.songwriting.net/winners|archive-date=July 24, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Myles's song "Black Velvet" was one of four selected to be covered on the [[CBC Television]] [[reality television show]] ''[[Cover Me Canada]].''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2011/06/06/cbc-cover-me-canada.html|title=New CBC reality contest to focus on Canadian music|publisher= CBC News|date=2011-06-06|access-date=2011-08-31}}</ref>

After terminating a six-year lease with Canadian indie label Linus Entertainment in August 2013, Myles's ''Black Velvet'' album was retitled ''85bpm'', repackaged for her 25th Anniversary with new images photographed by fellow Canadian Deborah Samuel. A newly recorded song written by Anne Peebles, produced by Michael Borkosky, "Can't Stand the Rain" was added to ''85bpm'', featuring a solo played by Canadian guitarist [[Jeff Healey]], re-released on Myles's independently owned label, Fascinate inc., digitally distributed by Tuncecore.com, with audio CDs and a 25th Anniversary live concert DVD, both distributed by [[Amazon.com]] in the US.
