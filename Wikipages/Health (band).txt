'''Health''' (often stylized as '''HEALTH''') is an American [[noise rock]]/[[Industrial music|industrial]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

== History ==
Health was created after its members agreed the name should be an "everyday word." After reviewing a long list of terms, "health" was the only one not taken.<ref name="Jones">{{cite news|url=http://www.imposemagazine.com/interview-health/2238/|title=Interview: Health|last=Jones|first=Kenya|date=2009-09-17|work=Impose Magazine|access-date=2009-09-10|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204005501/http://www.imposemagazine.com/interview-health/2238/|archive-date=2008-12-04}}</ref>

===''Health''===
Health first gained reputation through a remix of their song "[[Crimewave (song)|Crimewave]]" by experimental electronic band [[Crystal Castles (band)|Crystal Castles]] in August 2007. The rendition helped broaden Health's audience in anticipation for their full-length debut a month later released under [[Lovepump United Records|Lovepump United]]. The band's self-titled album was recorded in L.A.’s noise/experimental venue, The Smell. Known for its DIY mystique, Health knew how difficult, yet rewarding, it would be to record in the space. Famiglietti said in an interview, "The room completely changes the tone of anything you want to record; makes a lot of things dark and beautiful. It also makes everything sound like 'CLANG!' We didn't realize how hard it would be at all, we especially weren't prepared for the Vaquero bar dropping the reggaeton jamz at 1pm every day."<ref name="Jones"/> Their unique sound on the album caught the attention of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in which they wrote, "The near-innocuous opening track of Health's self-titled album, 'Heaven,' segues into the 36-second neurotic dissonance of 'Girl Attorney,' which picks up tempo on its transition into 'Triceratops'—a thrashing scourge of screeches, feedback, and gratuitous clanging reminiscent of [[Liars (band)|Liars]] laced with a relief of a [[Deerhunter]] meditation."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://admin.spin.com/articles/health |title=Artist of the Day: HEALTH |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=2007-11-06 |access-date=2014-08-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140812050343/http://admin.spin.com/articles/health |archive-date=2014-08-12 }}</ref>

Health released their first remix album, ''[[Health//Disco]]'' in 2008, which received favorable critical reception.<ref name="pitchfork11534">{{cite news |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11534-disco/ |title=HEALTH//DISCO |work=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=2008-05-23 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref>

That year the band opened for the rock band [[Nine Inch Nails]] on their Lights In The Sky tour.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/30200-nine-inch-nails-cancel-reschedule-some-shows/ |title=Nine Inch Nails Cancel, Reschedule Some Shows |work=Pitchfork Media |date=2008-09-17 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref>

===''Get Color''===
To promote their 2009 album, ''Get Color'', the band held a sweepstakes contest, in which a winner of a golden ticket was awarded a free trip to Los Angeles to go to [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] with the band. Other prizes included locks of the band members' hair and posters autographed in blood.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2009/10/01/best-contest-launched-by-an-la-band-healths-cd-sweepstakes-the-golden-ticket-is-discovered |title=Best Contest Launched By An L.A. Band: HEALTH's CD Sweepstakes (the Golden Ticket is Discovered!) |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=2009-10-01 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref> The album earned a score of eight from Pitchfork in which the review claimed "Never merely meager, this project delivers, both when you're waving your orgy-snorkel all blotto on-the-town, and for a soundtrack to serious rumination at your midday desk of harsh reality." Duzsik agreed with an interviewer that Get Color was indeed more accessible than their self-titled debut, but "It’s still crazy, though."<ref name="pitchfork11534" /> The track "Die Slow" was released as the album's single with its music video garnering nearly 500,000 views.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWZxThGh5wQ |title=HEALTH :: DIE SLOW :: MUSIC VIDEO |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11179-die-slow/ |title=Best New Track: HEALTH "Die Slow" |work=Pitchfork Media |date=2009-04-10 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref> The album received a positive score of 7.4 on Pitchfork.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13409-get-color/ |title=Reviews: HEALTH 'Get Color' |work=Pitchfork Media |date=2009-08-31 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref>

The band's second remix album with tracks from Get Color continued to receive critical acclaim. [[BBC]] reviewed the album and said, "Whatever HEALTH’s secret is for excellent remix albums, they would do well to bottle it up to flog to lesser-able musicians insistent on releasing similar affairs of a much lower standard. This might not actually improve on the original, but it comprises a fine complementary release for hardcore fans and newcomers alike."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/wqhf |title=HEALTH ::DISCO2 Review |work=[[BBC]] |date=2010 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref>

=== Video game soundtracks ===
In 2012, Health composed the soundtrack for the [[Rockstar Games]] video game, ''[[Max Payne 3]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/3cnv |title=HEALTH Max Payne 3: The Official Soundtrack Review |work=BBC |date=2012 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref> In an interview with Pitchfork, Duzsik said, "The number one reaction from HEALTH fans was, ‘What the fuck? You guys are doing a video game score?’ Just surprise. And very congratulatory." Duzsik continued, "It was fun to make music that was atypical for that sort of entertainment."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8977-health/ |title=The L.A. electro-noise band tell us what to expect from their forthcoming third LP. |work=Pitchfork Media |date=2012-10-29 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref>

Ivan Pavlovich, music director of ''Max Payne 3'' said, "We wanted to give Max a sound that is really an identifiable sound and HEALTH as a band has an incredible sense of who they are and a very strong identity. When we saw HEALTH perform live it was very clear that they were the ones who were going to be able to capture this."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNVlb5VPKjI |title=Scoring Max Payne 3 With HEALTH |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref>

The score was nominated for Best Score in a Game and "Tears" was nominated for Best Song in a Game at the 2012 [[Spike Video Game Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://gamerant.com/2012-spike-video-game-awards-vgas-winners/ |title=2012 Spike Video Game Awards Winners List |work=[[Game Rant]] |date=2012-12-07 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref> HEALTH later recorded a song called "High Pressure Dave" which appeared in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''; the song takes lyrics from "High Pressure Days" by [[The Units]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Health/_/High+Pressure+Dave |title=Health: High Pressure Dave |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref> Health also composed the soundtrack for ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online|GTA Online]]'s'' ''Arena War'' update.

===''Death Magic''===
Health's third album, ''[[Death Magic]]'', was released on August 7, 2015, on Loma Vista Records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9630-game-over-health-finish-first-album-in-six-years/ |title=Game Over: HEALTH Finish First Album in Six Years |access-date=2015-04-24 }}</ref> The album's release was preceded by three singles: On April 23, 2015, Health premiered "New Coke" on Sirius XMU. The song "Stonefist" would be the second single released in June. On July 24, "Men Today" was released as the third track from the album. In Autumn 2015, shortly after the release of the album, Jupiter Keyes left the band.

Disco 3 was released in the United States on February 17, 2017, in Loma Vista. Announced and released alongside a reverse telethon event on Facebook live, broadcast from the FunnyOrDie studios. Fans were asked to text a number in order to receive a call back from those involved, including BJ and John.

===''Vol. 4 :: Slaves of Fear''===
Health's fourth album, ''Vol. 4 :: Slaves of Fear'', was released February 8, 2019, on Loma Vista. The album was preceded by singles "Slaves of Fear", released in December 2018, and "Feel Nothing", released through the Adult Swim Singles Program in January 2019.

=== ''Disco4'' ===
==== ''Part I'' ====
On September 17, 2020, the band announced their fifth album, ''Disco 4: Part I'' (stylized as ''DISCO4:: PART I'').<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=|title=HEALTH announce collaborative album ‘DISCO 4:: PART I’ {{!}} News|url=http://diymag.com/2020/09/17/health-disco-4-part-i-album-100-gecs-cyberpunk-2020|access-date=2021-05-06|website=diymag.com|language=en}}</ref> Despite being called Disco 4 "in the interest of continuity",<ref name=":0" /> it is not a part of Health's "Disco" series of remix albums, but a collection of original collaborations (with the exception of the album's lead single, ''"Cyberpunk 2020"'', which was composed solely by Health themselves). The album was released through Loma Vista on October 16, 2020. An accompanying remix album, Disco4+, was later released on April 2, 2021 exclusively on the band's Bandcamp page.<ref>{{Cite web|title=DISCO4+, by HEALTH|url=https://youwillloveeachother.bandcamp.com/album/disco4|access-date=2021-05-06|website=HEALTH}}</ref>

==== ''Part II'' ====
On May 3, 2021, the band posted a short teaser on their social media accounts announcing a new song in collaboration with [[Nine Inch Nails]], ''"Isn't Everyone"'', to be released May 6. The trailer's description on YouTube confirmed that this would be the first song off of their next album, ''Disco 4: Part II''.<ref>{{Citation|title=HEALTH x NINE INCH NAILS :: ISN'T EVERYONE|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W2E6jNXzBE&list=TLPQMDYwNTIwMjH4V4FgwyfT0Q&index=1|language=en|access-date=2021-05-06}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Health has been described as having "artfully crafted noise and raw synth, haunting monotone vocals, and drum skills that are borderline insane."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rockinsider.com/2007/07/health-blowin-up.html |title=HEALTH - BLOWIN' UP |work=[[Rock Insider]] |date=2007-07-19 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref> [[Theguardian.com|Guardian Unlimited]] writer, Louis Pattison, describes the Crystal Castles version of "Crimewave" as "melancholy electro-pop built from pixelated synths and depressed vocals that hint at a past programme of busy and sustained serotonin depletion."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/18/popandrock.electronicmusic |title=Louis Pattison's new releases review |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2007-08-17 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref> The band's unusual sound can be partially credited to the use of the Zoothorn, which is a permutation of microphone and guitar pedal and an occasional atonal sound without a symmetrical structure.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://larecord.com/interviews/2007/03/10/health-hes-approving-friend-requests |title=HEALTH: HE’S APPROVING FRIEND REQUESTS |work=[[L.A. Record]] |date=2007-03-10 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref> Lyrically, the band describes the role of lyrics as being "purposely kept vague for the listener" "...[Lyrics] sort of begin to bring out this more individual quality to the whole thing like, ‘These are the lyrics, and this is the guy is singing them, so I can relate to that.’ Which is really not something we want. We wanted the vocals to have an even, unaffected feel. A softness, like a Zombies melody, or even a Gregorian chant. We aren't just interested in being a noisy screaming band."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://waytooindie.com/review/music/health-disco2/ |title=HEALTH – ::Disco2 |work=[[Way Too Indie]] |date=2012-07-03 |access-date=2014-08-11 }}</ref>
