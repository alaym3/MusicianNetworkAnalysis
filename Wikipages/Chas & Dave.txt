'''Chas & Dave''' (often billed as '''Chas 'n' Dave''') were a British [[pop rock]] duo, formed in London by [[Chas Hodges]]  and [[Dave Peacock (musician)|Dave Peacock]]. They were most notable as creators and performers of a musical style labelled ''rockney'' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[rock music|rock]]'' and ''[[cockney]]''), which mixes "pub singalong, [[music-hall]] humour, [[boogie-woogie]] piano and pre-[[Beatles]] rock 'n' roll".<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/rockney-geezers-a-kneesup-with-chas--dave-765966.html | title = Rockney geezers: A knees-up with Chas & Dave | date = 19 December 2007 | access-date = 27 June 2008 | work=The Independent | location=London}}</ref> For a time, ''Rockney'' was also the name of their record label, their major breakthrough being "Gertcha" in 1979, which peaked at No. 20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and was the first of eight Top 40 hit singles the duo played on. They had their biggest success in the early 1980s with "[[Rabbit (song)|Rabbit]]" and "[[Ain't No Pleasing You]]". They also had nine charting albums. In October 2013 they released ''That's What Happens'', their first studio album in 18 years.<ref name=happens>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/27/chas-and-dave-thats-what-happens|title=Chas & Dave: That's What Happens – review|author=Molloy Woodcraft|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=4 January 2015|date=2013-10-26}}</ref>

Hodges toured America when he was with Heads Hands & Feet, and it was during the tour that he had the idea of performing in his natural accent as he thought it "not quite real" performing in an American accent to an American audience.{{sfn|Hodges|2009|loc=Chapter 17: Heads Hands & Feet}} After Heads Hands & Feet broke up, in November 1972, Hodges spoke to Peacock about forming a band together where they can sing in their own accent and about things they knew. This would be the beginning of Chas & Dave.{{sfn|Hodges|2009|loc=Chapter 19: The Beginning}}  They had initially considered a few names, including Chubby. The name Chas & Dave came about when they were doing sessions together, and a producer often referred to them as one and said, "Here comes Chas and Dave", and later suggested: "Why don't you just call yourselves Chas and Dave?"<ref name=artsdesk /> They also recorded as Oily Rags ([[cockney rhyming slang]] for cigarettes - "fags"), and released a self-titled album with Gerry Hogan and Ian Wallace in 1974,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/artist/oily-rags-mn0001535693 |title=Oily Rags |first=Richie |last=Unterberger|work=AllMusic }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zSsKAQAAMAAJ |title=The Penguin encyclopedia of popular music |page=239|first=Donald|last= Clarke|publisher=Penguin Books|date= 1998 |isbn=9780140513707 }}</ref> as well as [[Oliver Edward Nelson in London with Oily Rags|an album]] with [[Oliver Nelson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/28/werejammin |title=We're jammin': Chas & Dave |first=Pascal|last= Wyse|date= 28 October 2005 |work=The Guardian }}</ref> The album ''Oily Rags'' was released by [[Signature Records]] owned by [[Bob Thiele]], whose wife [[Teresa Brewer]] recorded the first ever song written by Hodges and Peacock together, "Better Get Your Shoes On".{{sfn|Hodges|2009|loc=Chapter 19: The Beginning}}

The duo recorded their first album as Chas & Dave in 1974, and this album, ''One Fing'*'Anuvver'', was released in 1975 under the Retreat Records label. Burt joined the duo in 1976 as a drummer, and although they were in fact a trio since, the duo of Hodges and Peacock remained the main focus of the band.{{sfn|Hodges|2009|loc=Chapter 20: First Record Deal}} They were signed by [[EMI]] in 1977,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbo7AQAAIAAJ |title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Seventies Music |first=Colin |last=Larkin|publisher=Virgin Books|date=20 November 1997|page=86 |isbn=978-0753501542}}</ref> and the album ''Rockney'' was recorded that year and released in 1978.{{sfn|Hodges|2009|loc=Chapter 21: Second Record Deal}} A song from the album, "[[Strummin']]",  was their first song to reach the chart.

===1980s===
Chas & Dave first signed a management deal in 1978 with Bob England, who with business partner [[Natasha England]] then formed the 'Rockney' label with the duo in 1980, part of the England's Towerbell Records company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/1006186/natasha-england-singer-rock-roll-one-hit-wonder-iko-iko|title=Rock'n'Roll life of a one-hit wonder: Iko Iko's Natasha is back with a new album|first=Peter|last=Robertson|date=21 August 2018}}</ref> The first single released under this label, "[[Rabbit (song)|Rabbit]]" became their first top 10 hit single.

The duo were both fans of the football club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and they began their musical association with the club in 1981 when they recorded the FA Cup final single for Tottenham Hotspur with [[Ossie's Dream (Spurs Are on Their Way to Wembley)|Ossie's Dream]]"/"[[Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur]]".  They also recorded  "[[Tottenham, Tottenham]]" in 1982, and Tottenham Hotspur were victorious in both of these finals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/1322001.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; FA CUP &#124; 1981 – Villa thriller |work=[[BBC News]] |date=10 May 2001 |access-date=8 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingchronicle.com/FACUP/1982.html |title=1982 FA Cup Final |publisher=Sportingchronicle.com |access-date=8 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427011123/http://sportingchronicle.com/FACUP/1982.html |archive-date=27 April 2009 }}</ref> They recorded two further singles with Tottenham &ndash; the [[1987 FA Cup Final]] song "[[Hot Shot Tottenham!]]" and in 1991 when the team also won the [[1991 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], "[[When the Year Ends in One]]". They also recorded "The Victory Song (We're Off To Wembley 'Cos We Beat The Arsenal)" in 1991.{{sfn|Hodges|2009|loc=Chapter 27: I'm A Grandad }}

In 1982, they had their biggest success on the chart with "[[Ain't No Pleasing You]]", which reached number two on the UK chart and also charted in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. This song departed from their usual style and was a slower-paced break-up ballad, with strings added to the usual piano, drum and bass sound. The official video featured the orchestra backing the band. They were given a Christmas TV special on [[London Weekend Television|LWT]] that year, ''Chas and Dave's Christmas Knees-up''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ff1a649 |title=Chas and Dave's Christmas Knees-up (1982) |work=British Film Institute }}</ref>  After the Christmas special, they were offered their own television series, ''Chas and Dave's Knees-up'', broadcast in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ff1a94d |title= Chas and Dave's Knees-up[04/06/83] (1983) |work=British Film Institute}}</ref>

They also performed on the main stage at the Sunshine Festival in Upton-Upon-Severn on 30 August 2015. In December, they took their traditional Christmas show to the [[Hammersmith Apollo]]. In 2016, the band played in the week 7 episode of [[BBC One]]'s ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', performing their song "Rabbit".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6208080/|title=Week Seven|access-date=29 September 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>

==Musical style==
The songs for which Chas & Dave are most known are partly comic, and Chas & Dave are strongly identified with London's [[blue collar]] and working class pub sing-song culture. Their musical style is called ''rockney'' combining "[[rock music|rock]]" and "[[cockney]]", a word Hodges coined in 1976.{{sfn|Hodges|2009|loc=Chapter 19: The Beginning}} The style, performed in a [[Estuary English|London accent]], is a fusion of London [[music hall]] and [[rock and roll]].<ref name=aitch /> The rockney style was intentional from the beginning: when Hodges and Peacock got together as a duo in 1972, they felt an alternative to the way British bands copied American accents was needed. Hodges had toured America with Heads Hands & Feet and was performing in an American accent. He said:<ref name = LEP>{{cite news | url = http://www.lep.co.uk/wow/The-original-rockney-geezers.4184731.jp | title = The original rockney geezers| work = [[Lancashire Evening Post]] | date = 13 June 2008 | access-date = 13 July 2008}}</ref>

{{quote|I was singing in an American accent. I thought, 'You're being a fraud, you should sing in your own accent', and that's when I started to work on the idea.}}

He then contacted Peacock about the possibility of forming a band performing songs in their natural voice. According to Hodges, "One Fing 'n' Anuvver", the title track of their first album as Chas & Dave, was their first Rockney song. He first developed the style by speaking the lyrics out loud in his natural spoken accent and phrasing after he had written them. The melody was then added to the words so that his natural voice comes out when singing, instead of an imitation American accent.{{sfn|Hodges|2009|loc=Chapter 19: The Beginning}}

==Chas' death and band legacy==

On 22 September 2018, Hodges died from pneumonia  following treatment for cancer, aged 74.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/22/chas-hodges-chas-and-dave-dies |title=Chas and Dave singer Chas Hodges dies aged 74 |first=Aamna |last=Mohdin |date=22 September 2018 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>
