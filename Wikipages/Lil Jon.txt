== Musical style and influences ==
Jason Birchmeier of [[AllMusic]] has described Lil Jon's production as "bass-heavy", and his album ''[[Put Yo Hood Up]]'' as having "a long and varied list of guest rappers to accompany the beats". Describing that album with guest performers, Birchmeier remarked: "The end result is an album that resembles a street-level mixtape rather than a traditional artist-oriented album".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r536036/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Put Yo Hood Up: Review|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|date=May 22, 2001|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=December 23, 2009}}</ref>

Alex Henderson, also of AllMusic, contrasted Lil Jon's style of "rowdy, in-your-face, profanity-filled party music" with other Southern rappers, those who "have a gangsta/thug life agenda" and those who convey "serious sociopolitical messages".<ref name="Kings of Crunk">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r604626/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Kings of Crunk: Review |last=Henderson|first=Alex|year=2002|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 23, 2009}}</ref> Lil Jon has also found influence in rock music, having worked with [[Rick Rubin]] and [[Korn]].<ref name="bangs head">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486976/05122004/lil_jon_1.jhtml|title=Lil Jon Bangs Head, Creates 'Crunk-Rock'|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |date=May 12, 2004|publisher=MTV News|access-date=December 23, 2009}}</ref> He expresses this influence in his aggressive delivery and 'yelling' style of rap.
