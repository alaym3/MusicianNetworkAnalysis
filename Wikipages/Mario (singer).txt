In support of his dream, his mother bought him a karaoke machine. Mario joined a musical group in [[Milford Mill Academy]] with the oldest son of comedian [[Mo'Nique]] and best friend Jaye Brebnor and also his younger god sister Chea Tyler. Barrett learned to play the piano and used that skill as the basis for his melodies and songs. He was discovered at age eleven and signed by producer Troy Patterson, after singing "[[I'll Make Love to You]]" at a [[Coppin State College]] talent show.<ref name="Mario2"/> Mario attended [[Milford Mill Academy]] up until the tenth grade where he was inspired by his music teacher, during his early teen years, and was offered a [[record deal]] at the age of fourteen, signing with [[Clive Davis]]' [[J Records]].<ref name="Mario2" /> His musical influences include [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Brian McKnight]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Michael Jackson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboombox.com/mario-pays-his-respects-to-michael-jackson/|title=Mario Pays His Respects to Michael Jackson|publisher=Theboombox.com|access-date=July 8, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704213503/http://theboombox.com/mario-pays-his-respects-to-michael-jackson/|archive-date=July 4, 2015}}</ref> [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], and [[Joe (singer)|Joe]].

==Music career==

===2001–2003: ''Mario''===
{{Main|Mario (album)}}
In July 2001, Mario began recording his major-label debut album, titled ''[[Mario (album)|Mario]]'', which was nearly a year before the official release in March 2002. The album's lead single "[[Just a Friend 2002]]", which was a cover of [[Biz Markie]]'s song, was a success, peaking at number one on the charts. Follow-up singles were "[[Braid My Hair]]" and "[[Mario (album)|C'mon]]". He was the opening act on the ''Scream Tour 3'', which featured headliners such as [[B2K]], [[Marques Houston]], [[Nick Cannon]], [[Jhené Aiko]] and AJA. As of 2006, his debut album has sold over 700,000 copies.<ref name="Mario2" /> During this period, he became a draw in the teen market.<ref name="Mario2" />

===2004–2006: ''Turning Point''===
{{Main|Turning Point (Mario album)}}
After his debut album was released, Mario wanted to record an album that was more mature. He enlisted a number of well-known producers to help him, such as [[Scott Storch]] and [[Lil' Jon]]. He released his second album, ''[[Turning Point (Mario album)|Turning Point]]'' on December 7, 2004. The album was more successful than his first, mainly because of the hit single "[[Let Me Love You (Mario song)|Let Me Love You]]". The single, described by reviewers as "melodic and sweetly lilting, reminiscent of [[Michael Jackson]]'s vintage romantic ballads"<ref name="Mario2" /> was successful, peaking at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for nine consecutive weeks. The single was written by [[Ne-Yo]].<ref name="Mario2" /> Other follow-up singles include "[[How Could You (Mario song)|How Could You]]" co-written by [[J. Valentine]], with a cameo appearance in the video by [[rapper]] [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]]; "[[Here I Go Again (Mario song)|Here I Go Again]]" (whose video starred model/singer [[Cassie Ventura|Cassie]]) and "[[Boom (Mario song)|Boom]]"  featuring [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]]. To date, ''[[Turning Point (Mario album)|Turning Point]]'' is certified platinum and the lead single double-platinum.

In February 2006, Mario filed a lawsuit against his former manager, Troy Patterson, alleging that Patterson had paid him $50,000 for the sale of more than 3 million records, which was later found to be false accusations. Mario was later sued by Patterson and lost. Mario's new manager is J. Erving, and he was chosen by Mario.<ref>{{cite news| last=Gail| first=Mitchell| title=R&B artist Mario gets personal on 3rd album| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN1828950620070619| work=Reuters| date=June 18, 2007| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908013651/http://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN1828950620070619| archive-date=September 8, 2009}}</ref>

"Stranded" never labelled as the third single due to the limited airplay that it received. Lack of interest led to the single being cancelled, although in January 2010 the song entered on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs peaking at number 84. "[[Ooh Baby (Mario song)|Ooh Baby]]" was later confirmed to be the third single from the album, it peaked on the week of March 19, 2010 debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 95.

===2011–2016: Cancelled albums and departure from RCA Records===
Mario recorded an album with producer [[Rico Love]] from 2010 to mid-2011 under the tentative title ''Restoration''. Songs from this album included "My Bed", "Killa", "Bermuda", "[[The Walls (song)|The Walls]]", "Recovery", "Falling Down" and "Computer Love". During Mario's appearance on BET's [[106 & Park]] on July 10, 2013, Mario stated that he felt the album recorded with Rico Love did not feel part of his career plan and that he scrapped that album and went on to record his then titled album ''Evolve'', which was set to be released in September 2013, but was delayed to 2014. For his fifth album, Mario stated the album will include "Love songs, ballads, club records and general R&B", and has said there will be no EDM songs on this album. Mario took writers Jeremiah "Sickpen" Bethea and Jimi Bonet under his wing amongst others to write for this album. Production on the album includes work by Glass John, Bam Alexander, Pollow da Don and possibly Ne-Yo.

In an interview with ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', Mario was asked what direction he was trying to go with on his fifth album; his answer was, "I wanna give as much honesty as I can. I want to be honest, but grab the attention of everybody, but still compete so when you hear it on the radio it's pushing the envelope. The melodies coming out of me now are unorthodox— melodies I've never expressed before". He also confirmed he has five tracks that are definitely going on. "These tracks are like movies, they are intense", he added. Nevertheless, the album will probably feature a song centered on his mother, written by himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vibe.com/content/mario-page-3|title=Mario Talks Refocusing On Music & New Mixtape [Pg. 3] VIBE|date=December 2, 2010|access-date=January 2, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211123248/http://vibe.com/content/mario-page-3|archive-date=December 11, 2010}}</ref> In August 2011, [[RCA Music Group]] announced it was disbanding [[J Records]] along with [[Arista Records]] and [[Jive Records]].
