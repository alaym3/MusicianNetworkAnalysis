'''G-Unit''' (short for '''Guerilla Unit''')<ref>Williams, Houston; Diva, Amanda (April 12, 2005). [http://allhiphop.com/blogs/news/archive/2005/04/12/18129910.aspx "50 Cent's Ideal World Is "Peaceful", Rapper Explains Guns Unit].</ref> was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group formed by longtime friends and [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast]] [[rapper]]s [[50 Cent]], [[Tony Yayo]] and [[Lloyd Banks]]. After releasing a string of mixtapes in the early 2000s, including ''[[50 Cent is the Future]]'', ''[[God's Plan (album)|God's Plan]]'' and ''[[No Mercy, No Fear]]'', the group released their debut album ''[[Beg for Mercy]]'' in 2003, which went on to ship over 4,000,000 copies in the US and was certified [[RIAA certification|Quadruple Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album, which followed the critical and commercial success of 50 Cent's major-label debut ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'', served as a platform for Lloyd Banks, [[Young Buck]] and Tony Yayo to release their respective solo debut albums; ''[[The Hunger for More]]'' (2004), ''[[Straight Outta Cashville]]'' (2004) and ''[[Thoughts of a Predicate Felon]]'' (2005). In 2008, the group released their second album ''[[T·O·S (Terminate on Sight)]]''.
 
During Tony Yayo's imprisonment in 2003, the group recruited Tennessee-based rapper Young Buck, who was featured throughout the ''Beg for Mercy'' album. [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] was also added to the group, a proposition made by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]] in late 2003, to promote the [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]/[[Interscope Records|Interscope]] newcomer. However, due to The Game's "disloyalty" in the eyes of 50 Cent, he was soon removed from the group in March 2005. In April 2008, 50 Cent revealed Young Buck was no longer a part of the group due to his "excessive spending" and "inconsistent behavior". In early 2014, after Yayo and 50 Cent separately stated G-Unit was no more, the original members of the group reconciled and reunited at [[Summer Jam (festival)#Summer Jam 2014|Summer Jam 2014]], along with Young Buck after his six-year departure from the group. [[G-Unit Records]] artist [[Kidd Kidd]] was also added to the group upon its reformation. The group released their first collaborative project in six years, an EP titled ''[[The Beauty of Independence]]'' in August of the same year.

In April 2018, Kidd Kidd announced he was leaving both the group and G-Unit Records to become independent.<ref name="xxlmag.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/video/2018/04/kidd-kidd-departure-g-unit/|title=Kidd Kidd Leaves G-Unit to Find Success on His Own - XXL|access-date=November 24, 2018}}</ref> In June of the same year, 50 Cent announced the group has disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|last=https://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=June 12, 2018|title=50 Cent Announces Lloyd Banks' Exit From G-Unit Records|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.47242/title.50-cent-announces-lloyd-banks-exit-from-g-unit-records|access-date=June 21, 2020|website=HipHopDX}}</ref>

=== Debut album and success (2002–03) ===

=== Feud with The Game/solo albums (2004–07) ===
[[File:GUnitBKK.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three men and a woman holding decorative elephants|[[Olivia (singer)|Olivia]], [[Lloyd Banks]], [[Young Buck]] and [[50 Cent]] in [[Bangkok]], February 2006]]
During the production of Beg for Mercy, [[Los Angeles]] rapper [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] was discovered and placed into G-Unit by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]] of Interscope Records. Their plan was to market The Game as a devotee, or a loyal member of 50 Cent's "camp". The Game made his first appearances as a member of G-Unit on Lloyd Banks and Young Buck's debut albums, [[The Hunger for More]] and [[Straight Outta Cashville]]. Throughout 2004, The Game began working on his debut studio album, which was set to be executive produced by 50 Cent and [[Dr. Dre]]. In November 2004, the album's second single, [[How We Do (song)|How We Do]] featuring 50 Cent became a top 5 hit, as did the album's third single, [[Hate It or Love It]], which peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], being held back from the top spot by 50 Cent's single, [[Candy Shop]] featuring [[Olivia (singer)|Olivia]]. 

Beginning in 2005, tensions began to rise between 50 Cent and The Game, and shortly after the release of ''[[The Documentary]]'', tensions escalated into a full-scale feud which led to 50 Cent announcing that The Game had been kicked out of G-Unit, with 50 Cent claiming he had not received full credit for writing six songs from ''The Documentary''.<ref name="MTV-The Game">Reid, Shaheem (February 28, 2005).

In 2007 while leaving a studio, Tony Yayo (one third of G-Unit), and his friend Lodi Mack saw [[Jimmy Henchman]]'s (The Game's manager) 14 year old son. The two proceeded to assault the 14 year old which would lead to Lodi Mack's arrest.  He was sentenced to two years in Prison and in 2009 Jimmy Henchman hired a hitman to kill Lodi Mack. In 2017, Jimmy Henchman was found guilty of murder and is now spending 2 life sentences in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|last=https://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=May 2, 2020|title=Jimmy Henchman Reportedly Loses Appeal In Lodi Mack Murder|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.55722/title.jimmy-henchman-reportedly-loses-appeal-in-lodi-mack-murder|access-date=June 21, 2020|website=HipHopDX}}</ref>

==Other ventures==

===Clothing line===
The [[G-Unit Clothing Company]] was established in 2003, when 50 Cent teamed up with [[Marc Ecko]] (the founder of Eckō Unlimited), to create a line of clothing and accessories inspired by 50 Cent and fellow members of G-Unit.

===G-Unity Foundation===
G-Unit has founded [[G-Unity Foundation Inc.]] (often called simply G-Unity), a public foundation that provides grants to nonprofit organizations that focus on improving the quality of life for low-income and under served communities.

==Controversies==
===Ja Rule===
Before signing with [[Interscope Records]], 50 Cent had been in disputes with rapper [[Ja Rule]] and his label [[Murder Inc. Records]]. 50 Cent claimed that the feud began in 1999 after Ja Rule spotted him with a man who took his chain.<ref name=RS/> However, Ja Rule claimed the conflict stemmed from a video shoot in [[Queens]] because 50 Cent did not like Ja Rule "getting so much love" from the neighborhood.<ref>MTV News (November 3, 2003). [http://www.mtv.com/bands/j/ja_rule/news_feature_031103/index.jhtml Ja Rule on 50 Cent, God and Hip-Hop]. MTV. Retrieved July 29, 2007.</ref> A confrontation occurred in a New York studio where rapper [[Black Child (rapper)|Black Child]], a Murder Inc. artist, stabbed 50 Cent, which resulted in him having four [[surgical suture|stitches]].<ref name="MTV">Reid, Shaheem (April 25, 2003).

Since the stabbing, Black Child has made a diss towards 50 Cent, called "You the Wanksta". In the song, [[Black Child (rapper)|Black Child]] talks about shooting 50 Cent, stabbing him, amongst other things.

[[Caddillac Tah (rapper)|Cadillac Tah]] can also be heard dissing 50 Cent, on "Snitch in Da Club".

The exchange of insult tracks released from both parties culminated into Ja Rule releasing ''[[Blood in My Eye]]'', which was an album that mostly insulted 50 Cent. Ja Rule eventually tried to squash the feud with 50 Cent by using minister [[Louis Farrakhan]] in a televised interview. However, the attempt at peace lost credibility as the interview was scheduled a day before ''Blood in My Eye'' was released. As a result, most fans, along with 50 Cent, dismissed the interview as a blatant publicity stunt. Because of the ongoing feud between the two, 50 Cent's labelmates [[Eminem]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Obie Trice]], [[D12]] and [[Busta Rhymes]] have also become involved and have also released tracks which insult Ja Rule.

Ja Rule later released ''[[R.U.L.E.]]'' with the successful single, "New York", featuring [[Jadakiss]] and Fat Joe in which Ja Rule took subliminal shots at 50 Cent. This single prompted 50 Cent to enter a feud with the two featured artists (see article on "[[Piggy Bank (song)|Piggy Bank]]" for details).

Although it seemed that the feud was over, Ja Rule returned with a track entitled "21 Gunz".<ref>IllSeed. (April 2006).

Retrieved July 25, 2007.</ref> In response, [[Lloyd Banks]] and 50 Cent released the track "Return of Ja Fool" on Lloyd Banks' mixtape ''Mo Money in the Bank Pt. 4, Gang Green Season Starts Now''.

In an interview with MTV, [[Ja Rule]] has stated that his new album, ''[[The Mirror: Reloaded|The Mirror]]'', will not be continuing any past feuds that he has engaged in. He said: {{quote|There was a lot of things I wanted to say, and I didn't want there to be any bitter records on the album.

===The Game===
In early 2005, a feud between The Game and G-Unit began. Even before The Game's first album, ''[[The Documentary]]'', was released and their feud became public, there was tension between The Game and 50 Cent.<ref>March 2005 issue asks about The Game and 50 Cent's physical altercation. ''VIBE''. Retrieved July 26, 2007.</ref> Soon after ''The Documentary''{{'}}s release, 50 Cent felt that the rapper was disloyal for saying he did not want to participate in G-Unit's feud with other rappers, and even wanting to work with artists with whom G-Unit were feuding, such as [[Nas]] and [[Jadakiss]].

50 Cent also claimed that he was not getting his proper credit for the creation of the album. He also claimed that he wrote five of the songs, but The Game denied that. During that dispute, The Game confronted 50 Cent at the [[WQHT|Hot 97]] studio in [[New York City]] and members of The Game's entourage began shooting at 50 Cent and other members of the G-unit entourage, causing them to flee the building and causing Hot 97 radio security to shoot a member of The Game's entourage.<ref name=Beef>Rodriguez, Jayson (March 1, 2005).

50 Cent pointed out that [[Fat Joe]] painted a target on himself for partnering up with Ja Rule on the song "[[New York (Ja Rule song)|New York]]". 50 Cent recorded the track "[[Piggy Bank]]", in which he attacked Fat Joe. Fat Joe responded with a track entitled "My Fofo" and although he said that he would not respond in songs after this, he made one more track, "Victim" which 50 Cent is purportedly the subject of as well as a guest appearance on Rick Ross' Mafia Music remix. 50 Cent and Tony Yayo took more shots at him on "I Run NY".

Even though things died down, at the 2005 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], Fat Joe mentioned that all of the police presence in the venue was "courtesy of G-Unit" which related to his lyrical accusations that 50 Cent was a "snitch".<ref name="2005VMAS">{{YouTube|DTTg1ilOuxg|G-Unit and Fat Joe Controversy at 2005 VMAS}}, YouTube.

When asked about the 50 Cent and G-Unit situation in an interview Fat Joe said he will no longer be responding and that he has left it to his close friend Pistol Pete and his crew Kill All Rats (K.A.R) to handle. Pistol Pete appeared on The Game's "[[Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin]]" DVD and disrespected Tony Yayo, [[Chris Lighty]] (owner of Violator Records who had ties with 50 Cent<ref>[http://www.violator.com/artist_detail/?artist_id=50_cent 50 Cent affiliated with Violator Records].

In 2014 Fat Joe gave a track titled ''Free'' to [[DJ Kay Slay]] to use as he was working on his final album and told him he can do whatever he wants with it. In light of the 2012 BET Awards Kay Slay decided to get 50 Cent to do a verse for it and put his on his mixtape ''The Rise Of A City''. Although Fat Joe was unaware Kay Slay was putting 50 Cent on his track he approved stating unity is good for hip-hop.
That same year, Tony Yayo shouted out Fat Joe, saying that there was "no beef".

A feud between 50 Cent and [[Cam'ron]] began when 50 Cent was on [[WQHT|Hot 97]] giving an interview and [[Cam'ron]] called in.<ref name="50 Cent & Cam’ron Argument">{{YouTube|1DtTNKIBnjo|50 Cent on Angie Martinez Show}}, YouTube.

Cam'ron became upset and rebutted 50 Cent's statements. Most notably, he brought up the poor record sales of the [[Mobb Deep]] album, ''[[Blood Money (Mobb Deep album)|Blood Money]]''. Eventually the debate became so heated that the radio station was forced to end the call.<ref name="50 Cent & Cam’ron Argument"/> On February 9, 2007, the video of 50 Cent's "Funeral Music" premiered on [[DJ Kay Slay]]'s Myspace. The video attacked the leader of [[Dipset]]. This is not seen as an attack on other members of Dipset, as 50 Cent says "From now on, [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jimmy]]'s the boss of Dipset. And [[Juelz Santana|Juelz]] is the [[Caporegime|Capo]]. Cam is demoted to soldier. We like Jimmy better anyway". At the end of the video, there is a poster showing a fictional drawing of Cam'ron with a gun saying "50 Cent" on the burial, along with his date of death; being February 8 when the video was released. Cam'ron responded with a track called "Curtis", titled after 50 Cent's first name, Where he claims he enjoys 50 Cent's shoutouts to Dipset members Juelz Santana and Jim Jones, then goes on to discuss Santana's and Jim Jones' sales on their recent albums. 50 Cent and Young Buck made the song "Hold On" together with a video in which 50 Cent takes shots at Cam'ron. Cam'ron responded with "Curtis Pt.2", which he shot a video for. 50 Cent and Cam'ron ended their feud in 2016.
