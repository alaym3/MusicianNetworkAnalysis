In October 2019, Garrix lost his place as [[DJ Mag#Top 100 DJs|number 1 DJ]] to Belgian DJs [[Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike]], whom he beat to number 1 in 2016, after spending a consecutive three years at the top. Garrix finished the 2019 polls in second place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://djmag.com/top100dj?year=2019 |title=Top 100 DJs |publisher=DJMag.com |access-date=14 May 2020}}</ref> The next month, he announced on his Instagram account he have ended up his relationship for over three years with Dutch model Charelle Schriek.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edm.com/news/martin-garrix-charelle-schriek-split |title=Martin Garrix and Charelle Schriek Split After Three Years |publisher=edm.com |date=19 November 2019 |access-date=20 October 2020}}</ref>

On 24 December 2019, Spinnin' Records won the appeal from the court ruling of the Higher Court of Leeuwarden, suggesting that Garrix did not have the right to break his agreement prematurely with Spinnin' and MusicAllstars Management.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edm.com/news/spinnin-records-appeal-martin-garrix-lawsuit|title=Spinnin' Records Wins Appeal Against Martin Garrix's Lawsuit|last=Sunkel|first=Cameron|website=EDM.com - The Latest Electronic Dance Music News, Reviews & Artists|language=en|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref>

A few days after Spinnin' Records won the appeal, Martin's computer was hacked by an unknown assailant where the hacker stole and leaked a handful of unreleased music including "[[Rewind, Repeat It]]".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Martin Garrix - Gold Demo Leaks - Google Drive|url=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YXqnkg6gwhy6LW-rVx0FuFlEhb5kCR_d?usp=sharing|access-date=7 December 2020|website=drive.google.com}}</ref>

{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=I am delighted with the ruling of the Higher Court that we made valid agreements with Martijn at the time, which should have been respected. This statement confirms that the accusation of deception or fraud was unjustified. Even though I have since sold Spinnin' Records and MusicAllStars Management, those accusations were also aimed at me personally. I look back with pride on a successful collaboration with Martijn and wish him the best in his further career.
