In 2009, he released "Five-Two Television", and album covering a variety of themes and rap styles. It is his first album in which autotune is used, a controversial step among his fans. The album brings us the (fictitious) story of Chris Carlino, a man who has ruined his life, through a series of interludes. As usual for KJ-52, the album includes both songs with a strong Christian message and songs that are meant only to entertain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fusemix.com/en/the-leak/400-kj-52-releases-24-track-five-two-television-today--joins-pillar-a-run-kid-run-on-confessions-tour- |title=KJ-52 RELEASES 24 TRACK FIVE-TWO TELEVISION TODAY &#124;&#124; JOINS PILLAR & RUN KID RUN ON CONFESSIONS TOUR |publisher=Fusemix.com |date=September 22, 2009 |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

KJ-52 also rapped in the [[tobyMac]] remix of the song "One World" on the album ''Hip-Hope'' which also includes the KJ-52 remixed song "What You Want".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

KJ-52 released ''Dangerous'' on April 3, 2012. It mixes hip hop album with quite a bit of synth, and has some pop-electric. The first released single, "Dangerous", is more light rock-pop. The second single is called "Shake Em Up", but is commonly spelled "Shakem Up".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It features guest artists such as [[Canton Jones]] on "It's Goin Down", [[Lecrae]] on "They Like Me", Thi'sl on "Shake Em Up", George Moss on "Do the Bill Cosby", and more. His final track, "Go," is a remake of the [[Hillsong United (band)|Hillsong United]] song with the same name.

In 2017, KJ-52 released his first independent album "Jonah." The project was over 200% funded through Pledge Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/kj52|title=kj52: the Jonah album|website=PledgeMusic}}</ref> Following the release of the album, KJ-52 began working on an independent documentary about his life with filmmaker Denver Bailey. The film went on to raise 125% of the goal through kickstarter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1241791799/the-kj52-documentary|title=The KJ52 Documentary|website=Kickstarter}}</ref>  The film was released alongside KJ-52's second independent album titled "Jonah Pt. 2" on February 15, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/news/38-backstage/16903-kj-52-releases-jonah-pt-2-and-the-jonah-movie|title=KJ-52 Releases 'Jonah Pt. 2' and 'The Jonah Movie'|first=Justin|last=Sarachik}}</ref>

==Eminem and "Dear Slim" controversy==
KJ-52 was often compared to Eminem, as many called him a "Christian counterpart".<ref>{{cite web|date=January 3, 2001|title=The Christian Slim Shady? &#124; Teens|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/iyf/music/bandsartists/3.29.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830215134/http://www.christianitytoday.com/iyf/music/bandsartists/3.29.html|archive-date=July 31, 2021|access-date=October 11, 2011|publisher=Christianitytoday.com}}</ref> One of the most notable mainstream reactions to the Christian hip hop scene was to KJ-52 and his single "Dear Slim", which was written to Eminem in an attempt to reach him with the message of the gospel. The song became famous and controversial among Eminem fans when it was featured on the hit show ''[[Total Request Live]]''. KJ-52 began to receive hate mail (including death threats) from Eminem's fans, though KJ-52 claimed that the song was not being disrespectful.<ref name="KJInterview">{{cite web|title=ChristianMusicToday.com: KJ-52 Interview — Getting It Right|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2003/kj52-0903.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040126080726/http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2003/kj52-0903.html|archive-date=July 31, 2021|access-date=October 6, 2011|publisher=Christianitytoday.com}}</ref> The artist addressed it in a follow-up song titled "Dear Slim Pt. 2".
