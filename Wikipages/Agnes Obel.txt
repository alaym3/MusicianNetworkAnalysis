==Early life==
Agnes Caroline Thaarup Obel was born in [[Gentofte]], [[Copenhagen]] on 28 October 1980, the elder of two siblings. She and her younger brother, Holger, grew up in an unconventional environment, with a father who had three children from another marriage. He loved to collect strange objects and instruments. Her mother, Katja Obel, was a jurist and musician and she used to play [[Bartók]] and [[Chopin]] on the piano at home.<ref name="Telerama">{{cite news|last=Cassavetti |first=Hugo|title=Rencontre avec Agnes Obel|url=http://www.telerama.fr/musique/soif-de-spleen,65289.php|newspaper=Telerama|date=3 February 2011}}</ref> Obel learned to play the piano at a very young age. About her learning, she said: "I had a classical piano teacher who told me that I shouldn't play what I didn't like. So I just played what I liked. I was never forced to play anything else."<ref name="Stars are Underground">{{cite web | url=http://starsareunderground.free.fr/html/interviews/agnesobel.html | title=Agnes Obel Interview | date=9 November 2010 | website=starsareunderground.free.fr | language=fr | access-date=13 January 2014}}</ref> During her childhood, she found inspiration in [[Jan Johansson (jazz musician)|Jan Johansson]]'s work. Johansson's songs, European folk tunes done in a jazzy style, have been a strong influence on her musically.<ref name="La Voix du Nord">{{cite news|last=Moreau|first=Florence|title=Agnes Obel|url=http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/Locales/Metropole_Lilloise/actualite/Secteur_Metropole_Lilloise/2011/01/30/article_agnes-obel-les-melodies-viennent-comme-p.shtml|access-date=25 February 2011|newspaper=La Voix du Nord|date=30 January 2011|archive-date=14 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414000519/http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/Locales/Metropole_Lilloise/actualite/Secteur_Metropole_Lilloise/2011/01/30/article_agnes-obel-les-melodies-viennent-comme-p.shtml|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1990, she joined a small band as a singer and bass guitar player. The group appeared at a festival and recorded some tunes.<ref name="Le Monde">{{cite news|last=Davet|first=Stephane|title=La grace mélancolique secrète d'Agnes Obel|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2011/02/09/la-grâce-melancolique-de-la-secrete-agnes-obel_1477431_3246.html|access-date=28 February 2011|newspaper=Le Monde|date=10 February 2011}}</ref> In 1994, she had a small part in the short film ''The Boy Who Walked Backwards / Drengen der gik baglæns'' by [[Thomas Vinterberg]]. Her brother, Holger Thaarup, played the main character in the movie. Credited as Agnes Obel, she appears in two scenes. She plays a pupil who shares her table with the new student Andreas (Holger Thaarup).<ref name="IMDB">{{cite news|title=Drengen der gik baglæns on IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109673/|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

She attended high school at ''Det frie Gymnasium'', a free school where she was able to play a good deal of music. However, she quickly dropped out of school.<ref name="DR">{{cite news|last=Borg|first=Carina|title=Portræt af Agnes Obel|url=http://www.dr.dk/P1/Kulturnyt/Udsendelser/2010/12/20151932.htm|access-date=4 January 2011|newspaper=DR|date=29 December 2010}}</ref> "At seventeen,(...) I met a man who was running a studio. I gave up quickly my musical studies to learn sound techniques."

==Career==
===2008–2010: ''Philharmonics''===
Obel debuted as a solo singer with her first album ''[[Philharmonics (album)|Philharmonics]]'' (2010). She wrote, played, sang, recorded, and produced all the material herself. "The orchestral or symphonic music never interested me. I always was attracted by simple melodies, almost childish.(…) I put a long time before writing texts because the music seems to tell already a story, to project images."<ref name="Telerama"/> According to Obel, her piano is much more than an instrument: "The piano and the singing are two equal things to me – maybe not inseparable but very connected. You can say they are like two equal voices."<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news| title=New Faces Agnes Obel|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8433146/New-Faces-Agnes-Obel.html|date=6 April 2011 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Neil|last=McCormick}}</ref> She has said that, "The music is the most obvious means to express what I am, where I am."<ref name="Nord Eclair">{{cite news|last=Millecamps |first=Matthieu|title=La Grâce naturelle de Mademoiselle Obel|url=http://www.nordeclair.fr/Actualite/2011/09/13/la-grace-naturelle-de-mademoiselle-obel.shtml|website=Nordeclair.fr|date=13 September 2011}}</ref>

All of the songs on ''Philharmonics'' are original work except "Close Watch" ("I Keep A Close Watch" by [[John Cale]]) & "[[Katie Cruel]]" (a folk traditional; as the iTunes bonus track of the album). In ''Live à Paris'', released on 11 April 2011 on [[iTunes]], she sings a cover of [[Elliott Smith]]'s "Between The Bars". Furthermore, Obel did a duet with [[Editors (band)|Editors]] singer [[Tom Smith (musician)|Tom Smith]], performing "The Christmas Song" by [[Mel Tormé]] – to be found on the Smith & Burrows album ''Funny Looking Angels'' (released in November 2011).

''Philharmonics'' has garnered generally positive reviews with, for example, James Skinner from the BBC saying that "the compositions... are slow, sombre, sepulchral even, but not without a sense of occasionally singular beauty".<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|last=Skinner |first=James|title=Agnes Obel Philharmonics Review|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/hp4z|access-date=14 October 2010|newspaper=BBC |date=6 October 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101009211848/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/hp4z| archive-date= 9 October 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref> In the French cultural magazine ''Les Inrockuptibles'', Johanna Seban spoke about a "disarming purity" and stated, "There is, in these deeply melancholic ballads, the clearness and reassuring nobility of bedside discs."<ref name="Les Inrockuptibles">{{cite news|last=Seban |first=Johanna|title=Agnes Obel La Pureté désarmante|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/musique/musique-article/t/56328/date/2010-12-09/article/agnes-obel-et-la-purete-desarmante/|newspaper=Les Inrockuptibles|date=9 December 2010}}</ref> In Musicomh, Ben Edgell wrote that Obel "sings with a hushed and tender grace that waxes wistful and serene over yearning cello, harp, and piano vignettes.

Prior to the release of "Philharmonics", the soft, soothing tunes of "Just So" were used as the soundtrack of a commercial for Deutsche Telekom on German TV in 2008.

===2011–2014: ''Aventine''===
Obel began working on her second album in 2011. About her new album, she said, "I started to write new pieces, but all were instrumental ones, with the piano alone… In this moment, I feel more inclined to compose instrumental pieces. I already started to write some texts, but for me, it's more difficult to compose melodies."<ref name="Nord Eclair"/>

On ''Aventine'', Obel commented: "I recorded everything quite closely, miking everything closely in a small room, with voices here, the piano here – everything is close to you.

The web site Mushroompromotions said: "'Aventine' is a beautiful record, intriguingly unhurried. If the first record was a wander through the forest, this one takes the time to see the beauty and feel the texture in a single leaf. It is at once microcosmic and universal. (...) Agnes creates her own world, or as she calls it, a bubble or bell jar, to make her music. Once inside (or should that be outside?), she's no longer conscious of what's going on. This is the mystery of her modus operandi, something she cannot explain.

It's actually a legal term about the level of privacy the individual has in a state, and in health it's become a term about how much we know about a person's body or biology or history – if they're completely made of glass we know everything."

In addition to violins, cellos, [[harpsichords]], a [[spinet]], and a [[celesta]], Obel used a [[Trautonium]], a rare electronic musical instrument from the 1930s.<ref name="agnesobel.org/">{{cite news|title=Agnes Obel on Stay Loose|url=http://agnesobel.org/|website=Agnesobel.org|access-date=7 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708014718/http://agnesobel.org/|archive-date=8 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In September 2016, Obel released a new single, "Golden Green". In Dansende Beren, Niels Bruwier wrote: "The sound of glass is never far away. The song is about the way we always find other better lives than ours(…)she brings out her dreamy voice, it's actually just the perfect classic pop song without embellishment. Enchanting, elysisch and paradise-like."<ref name="Dansendeberen">{{cite news|title=Nieuwe single Agnes Obel – "Golden Green.|url=http://www.dansendeberen.be/2016/08/31/nieuwe-single-agnes-obel-golden-green/|website=Dansendeberen.be}}</ref>

In October 2016, a new song from ''Citizen of Glass'' was released: "Stretch Your Eyes". This song is a new version of an older one ("Spinet Song") which was played during her tour in 2014.

In October 2016, ''Citizen of Glass'' came out. The French newspaper ''[[La Croix]]'' wrote: "With several great songs, the surrealist ''Stretch your eyes'' or the luminous ''Golden Green'', Agnes Obel has created a sumptuous, odd and modern album. ''Citizen of Glass'' confirms, with greatness, Agnes Obel as an important pop artist."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Culture/Musique/Agnes-Obel-resonances-d-un-monde-de-verre-2016-10-17-1200796885|title=Agnès Obel, résonances d'un monde de verre |date=17 October 2016|access-date=25 October 2016|newspaper=La Croix }}</ref>

''Citizen of Glass'' received an average score of 81 on Metacritic, meaning universal acclaim, based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/citizen-of-glass/agnes-obel|title=Citizen of Glass by Agnes Obel|website=Metacritic.com}}</ref>

===2018–present: ''Late Night Tales'' and ''Myopia''===
In February 2018, Obel was signed to [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. The contract involved Deutsche Grammophon joining forces with Blue Note for North American releases. Mr. Trautmann, president of Deutsche Grammophon, said: "We are fascinated by Agnes's compositional autonomy and the precision with which she creates and produces her vocal and instrumental soundscapes. With every song and instrumental piece, she opens up small universes, thus reaching a broad audience with sophisticated works. With Agnes we share confidence in the long-term success of artistic excellence and credibility, as well as the intention to inspire many more fans around the world".<ref name="cmu.com">{{cite news|title=Deutsche Grammophon signs Agnes Obel|url= http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/deutsche-grammophon-signs-agnes-obel/|website=Completemusicupdate.com|date=26 September 2018}}</ref>

In May 2018, Obel contributed to ''[[Late Night Tales]]'' with a series of tracks selected by the artist herself, released as ''[[Late Night Tales: Agnes Obel]]''. For this compilation, Obel presented various titles by very different artists. Music by [[Michelle Gurevich]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Henry Mancini]], and [[Alfred Schnittke]] is included on this album.

Obel said: "I was surprised at how much time I ended up spending on this. I collected all the songs together with my partner Alex and we just spent time listening to records, trying to see what would fit together. Some of the music I've included here is on mixtapes we made when we were just friends as teenagers."<ref name="ventsmagazine.com">{{cite news|title=Late Night tales|url=http://ventsmagazine.com/2018/04/05/agnes-obel-announces-late-night-tales-compilation-out-5-25-listen-to-poem-about-death/|date=April 2018|website=Ventsmagazine.com}}</ref>

Obel combined new works with the original song "Bee Dance", a haunting reading of the Danish song "Glemmer Du", and a new version (the third one) of "Stretch Your Eyes" called "Ambient Acapella". The first single, [[Inger Christensen]]'s "Poem About Death", is set to original music by Obel.

On the topic of the haunting cover of [[Arvid Muller]]'s "Glemmer du", Obel explained: "In [[Denmark]], the song is best known in the version from 1932, sung by the actor and singer [[Liva Weel]]. It's one of my favourite melodies. The song is about the impermanence of time and love, with memories being the only thing you get at the end. (...)I recorded it using analog tape and then running the tapes again, so it sounded old and re-recorded, playing with this feeling of remembrance and of lost time."<ref name="npr.org">{{cite news|title=Agnes Obel explains her tracks|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2018/05/21/612357081/agnes-obel-explains-her-late-night-tales-track-by-track?t=1529929268749|website=Npr.org}}</ref>

On 29 October 2019, Obel announced the title of her upcoming album, ''Myopia'', on social media, and released the new single "Island of Doom". The album was released on 21 February 2020. Journalist Tim Peacock wrote: "Obel has been under self-imposed creative isolation with the removal of all outside influences and distraction in the writing, recording and mixing process for 'Myopia'."

About "Island of Doom", the artist said: "The song is made up of pitched-down piano and cello pizzicato and vocals, all choirs are pitched down and up… In my experience when someone close to you dies it is simply impossible to comprehend that you can't ever talk to them or reach them somehow ever again."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/agnes-obel-album-myopia/|title=Agnes Obel Announces New Album Myopia, Single Island Of Doom|last=Peacock|first=Tim|date=29 October 2019|website=uDiscover Music|language=en-US|access-date=29 October 2019}}</ref>

"Island of Doom" features Obel on piano, vocals, and keys, and Kristina Koropecki on cello, creating a sober tone, with sweet instrumentals, and a strong vocal performance from Obel. The visual show opens up with a shot of Obel and is completely dominated with blue colors and hues, showing a unique landscape that appears out of this world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2019/10/29/news/agnes-obel-announces-new-album-myopia-for-february-2020-release/|title=Agnes Obel Announces New Album Myopia|last=Grech|first=Aaron|date=29 October 2019|website=mxdwn.com|language=en-US|access-date=29 October 2019}}</ref>

The new music video was directed by Alex Bruel Flagstad.

Concerning the meaning of ''Myopia'', Obel explained: "For me ''Myopia'' is an album about trust and doubt. Can you trust yourself or not? Can you trust your own judgments? Can you trust that you will do the right thing? Can you trust your instincts and what you are feeling? Or are your feelings skewed?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/10/agnes-obel-announces-myopia-shares-island-of-doom.html|title=Agnes Obel Shares "Island of Doom," New Single/Video off Forthcoming Album Myopia|last=Gersten|first=Amanda|date=29 October 2019|website=PASTE|language=en-US|access-date=29 October 2019}}</ref>

On 7 January 2020, Obel released the single "Broken Sleep." Journalist Drew Feinerman said: "The video (created by Obel's longterm collaborator and partner Alex Brüel Flagstad) pairs perfectly with the style of the composition; Obel sings with such beauty and ease, as the vocals complement the effortless, flowing pace of the visuals."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2020/01/07/news/agnes-obel-releases-abstract-minimalist-style-video-for-new-song-broken-sleep/|title=Agnes Obel Releases Abstract, Minimalist-Style Video for New Song "Broken Sleep"|last=Feinerman|first=Drew|date=7 January 2020|website=music.mxdwn.com|language=en-US|access-date=7 January 2020}}</ref>

About ''Myopia'', journalist Tina Benitez-Eves stated: "Myopia is an abstract anatomization of the human psyche, transcending through ambient instrumentals, and an intoxicating blend of vocals, hovering on Jarboe-bred voice manipulation on atmospheric "Broken Sleep" and "Island of Doom."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/agnes-obel-explores-solitary-confinement-on-myopia/ |title=Agnes Obel Explores Solitary Confinement on 'Myopia'|date=8 May 2020|website=americansongwriter.com|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref>

Ashley Bardhan, in ''Pitchfork'', said also: "These songs are obscured like frosted glass, as meticulously pretty and faintly unnerving as a porcelain doll. 
Though the album ends almost as quietly as it began, Obel's whispery ambient fog lingers far longer."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/agnes-obel-myopia/|title=Agnes Obel 'Myopia'}}</ref>

In June 2020, and for the first time, Obel shows in a video her Berlin studio and improvises some music with her band. The artist writes mostly at night and is always alone in her private studio in Berlin. Normally, Obel doesn't let anyone visit her there.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.fr/pin/136022851234303227/|title=Musician Agnes Obel Shows Us Her Intimate Berlin Studio}}</ref>

[[File:Agnes Obel by Eric VALLET.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Obel at Les Nuits Secrètes (2014)]]
===Musical style===
Obel is described by ''[[The Irish Times]]'' journalist Lauren Murphy as "the architect of eerie, otherworldy music that straddles [[neo-classical music|neo-classical]], [[jazz]] and [[chamber pop]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Lauren|date=March 14, 2020|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/agnes-obel-architect-of-eerie-otherworldy-music-1.4195114|title=Agnes Obel: Architect of eerie, otherworldy music|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=June 19, 2021}}</ref> In another analysis, ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' magazine's Lauren McDermott deems Obel's music "poised and haunting chamber pop" with "wraithlike harmonies, sonic textures and bewitching melancholy" rendered with "gothic violins", "cello pizzicatos", and electronic instruments, lending a sense of intimacy reflective of the aura in Berlin.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=McDermott|first=Lauren|date=February 19, 2020|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/features/in-conversation-agnes-obel|title=In Conversation: Agnes Obel|magazine=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|accessdate=June 19, 2021}}</ref>
