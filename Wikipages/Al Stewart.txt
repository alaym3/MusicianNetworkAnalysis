'''Alastair Ian Stewart''' (born 5 September 1945) is a Scottish<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/stewart_al/bio.jhtml |title=Al Stewart Bio &#124; MTV |publisher=VH1 |access-date=6 April 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404101758/http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/stewart_al/bio.jhtml |archive-date=4 April 2008  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://npaper-wehaa.com/boulder-weekly/2009/12/17/?g=print#?article=692449|title=Boulder Weekly by Wehaa|website=npaper-wehaa.com|access-date=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801195215/http://npaper-wehaa.com/boulder-weekly/2009/12/17/?g=print#?article=692449|archive-date=1 August 2017}}</ref> singer-songwriter and [[folk rock|folk-rock]] musician who rose to prominence as part of the [[British folk revival]] in the [[1960s in music|1960s]] and [[1970s in music|1970s]]. He developed a unique style of combining folk-rock songs with delicately woven tales of characters and events from history.<ref>{{cite book|title=The British Folk Revival, 1944–2002|last=Brocken|first=Michael |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2003|page=110|isbn= 978-0-7546-3282-5|oclc=51389150|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2gU4URxmuQ4C&q=%22folk+revival%22+%22al+stewart%22&pg=PA110}}</ref>

Stewart is best known for his 1976 hit single "[[Year of the Cat (song)|Year of the Cat]]", from the platinum album of the same name. Though ''[[Year of the Cat]]'' and its 1978 platinum follow-up ''[[Time Passages]]'' brought Stewart his biggest worldwide commercial successes, earlier albums such as ''[[Past, Present and Future (Al Stewart album)|Past, Present and Future]]'' from 1973 are often seen as better examples of his intimate brand of historical folk-rock, a style to which he returned in later albums.<ref name=lasvegassun>{{cite news| first = Joe| last = Brown| title = Al Stewart: Heady concert to engage history in singer's lyrics| url = http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/feb/18/heady-concert-engage-history-singers-lyrics/| work = Las Vegas Sun| location = Las Vegas| date = 18 February 2009| access-date = 19 February 2009| quote = ...Stewart says on the phone from his home in Los Angeles.| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221111055/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/feb/18/heady-concert-engage-history-singers-lyrics/| archive-date = 21 February 2009| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Stewart is a key figure in British music and he appears throughout the musical [[folklore]] of the revivalist era. He played at the first-ever [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 1970, knew [[Yoko Ono]] before she met [[John Lennon]], and shared a London flat with a young [[Paul Simon]] who was collaborating with [[Bruce Woodley]] of [[The Seekers]]. Stewart hosted at the [[Les Cousins (music club)|Les Cousins]] [[folk club]] in London in the 1960s.<ref name="Kaya Burgess">{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article2417483.ece|title=Al Stewart, the return of the cat|access-date=12 May 2009|date=12 May 2009|work=[[The Times]]|author=Kaya Burgess| location=London}}</ref>

Stewart has released 16 studio and three live albums since his debut album ''[[Bed-Sitter Images]]'' in 1967, and continues to tour extensively in the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK. His most recent release, ''[[Uncorked (album)|Uncorked]]'', was released on Stewart's independent label, Wallaby Trails Recordings, in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.appleseedrec.com/alstewart/index.html |title=Appleseedrec.com |publisher=Appleseedrec.com |access-date=6 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144353/http://www.appleseedrec.com/alstewart/index.html |archive-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Stewart has worked with [[Peter White (musician)|Peter White]], [[Alan Parsons]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], [[Rick Wakeman]], [[Francis Monkman]], [[Tori Amos]], and [[Tim Renwick]], and more recently has played with [[Dave Nachmanoff]] and former [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]] lead-guitarist [[Laurence Juber]].

==Early life==
Although born in [[Glasgow]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/278290/al-stewart/biography |title=Al Stewart: Biography |work=Billboard |access-date=12 May 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926100104/http://www.billboard.com/artist/278290/al-stewart/biography |archive-date=26 September 2015  }}</ref> Al Stewart grew up in the town of [[Wimborne]], Dorset, England, after moving from Scotland with his mother, Joan Underwood. His father, Alastair MacKichan Stewart, who served as a flight lieutenant in the [[Royal Air Force]] volunteer reserve, died in a plane crash during a 1945 training exercise before Stewart was born.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alastair MacKichan Stewart |url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0556&type=P |publisher=The University of Glasgow Story |access-date=24 January 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731054154/http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH0556&type=P |archive-date=31 July 2013  }}</ref> Stewart attended [[Wycliffe College, Gloucestershire]] as a boarder. After that, according to the song "Post World War II Blues" (from ''[[Past, Present and Future (Al Stewart album)|Past, Present and Future]]''): ''"I came up to London when I was 19 with a corduroy jacket and a head full of dreams."''

Having bought his fourth guitar from future [[The Police|Police]] guitarist [[Andy Summers]], Stewart traded in his electric guitar for an acoustic guitar when he was offered a weekly slot at [[Bunjies]] Coffee House in London's [[Soho]] in 1965. From there, he went on to serve as [[master of ceremonies]] at the [[Les Cousins (music club)|Les Cousins]] [[folk club]] on [[Greek Street]], where he played alongside [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bert Jansch]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]], [[Ralph McTell]] and [[Paul Simon]], with whom he shared a flat in Dellow Street, Stepney, London.<ref name="Kaya Burgess" />

==Career==
Stewart's first recording was on [[Jackson C. Frank]]'s debut album, 1965's ''[[Jackson C. Frank (album)|Jackson C. Frank]]'', playing guitar on "Yellow Walls". His first record was the single "The Elf" (backed with a [[cover version|version]] of [[The Yardbirds]]' "Turn into Earth"), which was released in 1966 on [[Decca Records]] and included guitar work from [[Jimmy Page]] (later of the Yardbirds and [[Led Zeppelin]]). Stewart then signed to [[Columbia Records]] (CBS in the UK), for whom he released six albums. Though the first four of these attracted relatively little commercial interest, Stewart's popularity and cult following grew steadily through albums that contain some of Stewart's most incisive and introspective songwriting.

===Early albums (1967–1973)===
Stewart's debut album, ''[[Bedsitter Images]]'', was released in 1967. A revised version appeared in 1970 as ''The First Album (Bedsitter Images)'' with a few tracks changed, and the album was reissued on CD in 2007 with all tracks from both versions. 

''[[Love Chronicles]]'' (1969) was notable for the 18-minute title track, an anguished autobiographical tale of sexual encounters that was the first mainstream record release ever to include the word "fucking".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Subcultures Reader |last=Gelder |first=Ken |author2=Thornton, Sarah|publisher=Routledge |year=1997| location=London |page=413|isbn= 978-0-415-12727-1|oclc=34513133|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1jHcXUTNmIw}}</ref> It was voted "Folk Album of the Year" by the UK music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and features [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] on guitar.

His third album, ''[[Zero She Flies]]'', followed in 1970 and included a number of shorter songs which ranged from acoustic ballads and instrumentals to songs that featured electric lead guitar. These first three albums (including ''The Elf'') were later released as the two-CD set ''To Whom it May Concern: 1966–70''.

In 1970, Stewart and fellow musician [[Ian A. Anderson]] headed to the small town of [[Pilton, Somerset]]. There, at [[Michael Eavis]]'s [[Worthy Farm]], Stewart performed at the first-ever [[Glastonbury Festival]] to a field of 1,000 hippies, who had paid just £1 each to be there.

On the back of his growing success, Stewart released ''[[Orange (Al Stewart album)|Orange]]'' in 1972. It was written after a tumultuous breakup with his girlfriend and muse, Mandi, and was very much a transitional album, combining songs in Stewart's confessional style with more intimations of the historical themes that he would increasingly adopt (e.g., "The News from Spain" with its [[progressive rock]] overtones, including dramatic piano by [[Rick Wakeman]]).

The fifth release, ''[[Past, Present and Future (Al Stewart album)|Past, Present and Future]]'' (1973), was Stewart's first album to receive a proper release in the United States, via [[Janus Records]]. It echoed a traditional historical storytelling style and contained the song "Nostradamus," a long (9:43) track in which Stewart tied into the rediscovery of the [[Nostradamus|claimed seer]]'s writings by referring to selected possible predictions about 20th century people and events. While too long for mainstream radio [[airplay]] at that time, the song became a hit on many US college/university radio stations, which were flexible about running times.

Such airplay helped the album to reach No. 133 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart in the US. Other songs on ''[[Past, Present and Future (Al Stewart album)|Past, Present and Future]]'' characterized by Stewart's "history genre" mentioned American President [[Warren G. Harding]], World War II, [[Ernst Röhm]], [[Christine Keeler]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s purges.

===Alan Parsons years (1975–1978)===
Stewart followed ''Past, Present and Future'' with ''[[Modern Times (Al Stewart album)|Modern Times]]'' (1975), in which the songs were lighter on historical references and more of a return to the theme of short stories set to music. Significantly, though, it was the first of his albums to be produced by [[Alan Parsons]].

In a highly positive retrospective review of ''Modern Times'', [[AllMusic]] senior editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] described the album as "exquisite". Erlewine wrote that the album "establishes Stewart's classic sound of folky narratives and Lennonesque melodies, all wrapped up in a lush, layered production from Alan Parsons. The production gives epics like the title track a real sense of grandeur that makes their sentiments resonate strongly."<ref>{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/modern-times-mw0000084071 |title=Modern Times – Al Stewart : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=6 April 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202204751/http://www.allmusic.com/album/modern-times-mw0000084071 |archive-date=2 February 2013  }}</ref>

''Modern Times'' produced Stewart's first hit single, "Carol". The album reached No. 30 in the US and received substantial airplay on album-oriented stations some 30 years before [[Bob Dylan]] would release an album of the [[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|same name]].

Stewart's contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] expired at this point, and he signed to [[RCA Records]] for the world outside North America. His first two albums for RCA, ''[[Year of the Cat]]'' (released on [[Janus Records]] in the US, then reissued by [[Arista Records]] after Janus folded) and ''[[Time Passages]]'' (released in the U.S. on Arista), set the style for his later work and have been his biggest-selling recordings.<ref>"Al Stewart's passing time very well after 'Time Passages'", St. Petersburg Times, 11 January 1979, retrieved from [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CxMOAAAAIBAJ&dq=year-of-the-cat%20time-passages%20successful%20al%20stewart&sjid=NnwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6484%2C1794892 Google News Archive]</ref>

Stewart told Kaya Burgess of ''[[The Times]]'': "When I finished ''Year of the Cat'', I thought: ‘If this isn't a hit, then I can't make a hit.' We finally got the formula exactly right."<ref name="Kaya Burgess" />

Stewart had all of the music and orchestration written and completely recorded before he had a title for any of the songs. He mentioned in a Canadian radio interview that he has done this for six of his albums, and he often writes four different sets of lyrics for each song.<ref>[http://www.ciut.fm/index.php/shows-2/interview-with-al-stewart/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927191244/http://www.ciut.fm/index.php/shows-2/interview-with-al-stewart/|date=27 September 2011}}</ref>

Both albums reached the top ten in the US, with ''Year of the Cat'' peaking at No. 5 and ''Time Passages'' at No. 10, and both albums produced hit singles in the US ("Year of the Cat" No. 8, and "On the Border", #42; "Time Passages" No. 7 and "[[Song on the Radio]]", #29). Meanwhile, "Year of the Cat" became Stewart's first chart single in Britain, where it peaked at No. 31. It was a huge success at London's Capital Radio, reaching number 2 on their Capital Countdown chart. The overwhelming success of these songs on the two albums, both of which still receive substantial radio airplay on classic-rock/pop format radio stations, has perhaps later overshadowed the depth and range of Stewart's body of songwriting.<ref>{{cite web |author=David Dudley |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1995-10-12/music/living-in-the-past |title=Living in the Past – Page 1 – Music |work=Miami New Times |date=12 October 1995 |access-date=6 April 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728204325/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1995-10-12/music/living-in-the-past/ |archive-date=28 July 2012  }}</ref>

===1980s===
Stewart then released ''[[24 Carrots]]'' (#37 US 1980) and his first live album ''[[Live/Indian Summer]]'' (#110 US 1981), with both featuring backing by [[Peter White (musician)|Peter White]]'s band Shot in the Dark (who released their own album in 1981). While "24 Carrots" did produce a No. 24 single with "[[Midnight Rocks]]", the album sold less well than its two immediate predecessors.

After those releases, Stewart was dropped by Arista and his popularity declined. Despite his lower profile and waning commercial success, he continued to tour the world, record albums, and maintain a loyal fanbase. There was a four-year gap between his next two albums, the highly political ''[[Russians and Americans]]'' (1984) and the upbeat pop-oriented ''[[Last Days of the Century]]'' (1988), which appeared on smaller labels and had lower sales than his previous works.

===1990s===
Stewart followed up with his second live album, the acoustic ''[[Rhymes in Rooms]]'' (1992), which featured only Stewart and [[Peter White (musician)|Peter White]], and ''[[Famous Last Words (Al Stewart album)|Famous Last Words]]'' (1993), which was dedicated to the memory of the late Peter Wood (co-writer of "Year of the Cat"), who died the year of its release.

After parting ways with his longtime collaborator of almost 20 years, Peter White (who was credited on every studio and live album between ''Year of the Cat'' and ''Famous Last Words'' and also served as his regular songwriting partner), Stewart joined with former Wings guitarist Laurence Juber to record a concept album, ''[[Between the Wars (Al Stewart album)|Between the Wars]]'' (1995), covering major historical and cultural events from 1918 to 1939, such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]], [[Prohibition]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], and the [[Great Depression]]. Juber produced the album, and went on to produce Stewart's subsequent studio albums.

In 1995, Stewart was invited to play at the 25th anniversary Glastonbury Festival.

===21st century===
In 2000, Stewart released ''[[Down in the Cellar]]'', a concept album themed on wine. Stewart had begun a love affair with wine in the 1970s when, he admitted, he had more money than he knew how to spend,<ref>Liner notes ''Down in the Cellar''</ref> and so turned to fine wines.

In 2005, he released ''[[A Beach Full of Shells]]'', which was set in places varying from First World War England to the 1950s [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] scene that influenced him.

In 2008, he released ''[[Sparks of Ancient Light]]'', produced, like his most recent albums, by Laurence Juber. On this album he weaves tales of [[William McKinley]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], and [[Hanno the Navigator]]. A video for the song "Elvis at the Wheel" was released in December 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMOJr4MCsrk |title=Elvis at the Wheel – Al Stewart (Official Music Video) |via=YouTube |date=20 December 2013 |access-date=22 March 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014184700/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMOJr4MCsrk |archive-date=14 October 2014  }}</ref>

Stewart and guitarist [[Dave Nachmanoff]] released a live album, ''[[Uncorked (Live with Dave Nachmanoff)|Uncorked]]'', on Stewart's label, Wallaby Trails Recordings, in 2009.<ref>[http://www.davenach.com/news.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325211838/http://www.davenach.com/news.html|date=25 March 2009}}</ref> They played the Glastonbury Festival 40th anniversary in June 2010 on the acoustic stage.

Stewart sang a duet with [[Albert Hammond]] of Hammond's "[[It Never Rains in Southern California]]" on Hammond's 2010 album ''Legend''.

In 2011, Stewart sang a duet with his guitarist and opening act Dave Nachmanoff on Nachmanoff's album ''Step Up''. The song, "Sheila Won't Be Coming Home", was co-written by Stewart and Nachmanoff.

In May 2015, Stewart performed the albums ''Past, Present and Future'' and ''Year of the Cat'' in their entirety at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with a band that included Tim Renwick, Peter White and Stuart Elliott, who had appeared on the original recordings.

In April 2017, Stewart was given a Lifetime Achievement award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, presented by [[Tony Blackburn]], with whom he had once played in a band in Dorset.<ref>{{cite news |title=Al Stewart and Ry Cooder receive lifetime achievement gongs at BBC Folk Awards |url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/national/article/Al-Stewart-and-Ry-Cooder-receive-lifetime-achievement-gongs-at-BBC-Folk-Awards-4e7d2ea2-b507-416b-b4be-000f7dd9f9a4-ds |access-date=1 June 2018 |work=News & Star |date=6 April 2017}}</ref>

==Residence==
Born in Scotland, raised in [[Dorset]], and gaining fame in London, Stewart moved to Los Angeles<ref name="lasvegassun"/> shortly after the release of ''[[Year of the Cat]]''.

===Literary sources===
"Sirens of Titan", from ''Modern Times'' is a musical precis of [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s [[The Sirens of Titan|novel of the same title]].

On occasion, Stewart has set poems to music, such as "My Enemies Have Sweet Voices" (lyrics by the poet [[Pete Morgan]]) on the 1970 album ''Zero She Flies''. During his 1999 UK tour, Stewart invited Morgan to read the lyrics as he performed this song in the [[Leeds City Varieties]] Theatre show of 7 November 1999. Stewart also invited Morgan to read the poem at the Beverly gig on the same tour, whilst Stewart took a short break, and Morgan subsequently read another poem from his works as well.

==Songwriting==
In a 23 June 2012 telephone interview with Bob Reid and Blair Packham on NewsTalk 1010 AM in Toronto, Ontario<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstalk1010.com/Episodes.aspx?PID=1776 |title=IN-DEPTH RADIO :: Podcast Episodes |publisher=NEWSTALK 1010 |access-date=22 March 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322165256/http://www.newstalk1010.com/Episodes.aspx?PID=1776 |archive-date=22 March 2014  }}</ref> (partially transcribed below), Al Stewart provided these insights into his songwriting "process":

<blockquote>I don't like repetition. For example, there have been nine songs in the Top Ten, I think, called "Hold On" (Including, I think, once there were two called "Hold On" simultaneously in the Top Ten). OK, if you're really cynical, and you've written a new song, you'll probably want to call it "Hold On" because it gives you an extra edge. But at the same time it shows so little interest in originality that I can't actually listen to anything called "Hold On" at this point in my life. I mean, it just seems crazy. So, if I have two little rules and guiding principles, they would be:

(a) Don't use words that other people use. Very few people would put the word, oh, I don't know, "pterodactyl" into a song. So that's fine. No "Oh"'s. No "Baby"'s. No "I miss you so"'s. And no "you done me wrong". No "bad"'s or "sad"'s.

(b) And the other thing is, write about subjects that no one else writes about. Basically 90% of all songs seem to be either "Baby, I love you so", or "Baby, you've done me wrong". Now, when people look at songs, when I play anybody on the planet this song, and I say "What is this?", they will say, "Oh, that's Reggae", or "Oh, that's Heavy Metal", or "That's Country & Western", or "Oh, that's Opera", you know what I mean? But that's not what I asked. They're answering a question I didn't ask. What they're saying is "That's the music". What I'm saying is "What is the song?" And the song is either "I've done you wrong", or, "Baby, I love you so", no matter what style it's played in. In other words, there's a huge difference between content and style, and, if you work more towards content, why not make it content that is original.

…

If it's already been written, why write it again? If it's already been said, why say it again? I mean there are some remarkable quotes that I love. But I didn't say them. And you don't want to pass them off as your own work. Napoleon said that "Time spent in reconnaissance is never wasted". And that, actually, has governed my life. You know what I mean? That's a quote you can live by. But it's not my quote. So if I say it I always credit it to Napoleon. There is another way of saying any of the things you want to say, rather than rehashing someone else's words.

…

I think of songs as cinema, really. It's aural cinema. I want to show you a movie when I'm playing a song. That's essentially what I'm doing. And, of course, the songs are geographical too. One of the ways I get inspired to write a song – and this will always produce a song that sounds like nothing else (I can't recommend this highly enough) – I just open a world atlas, just at random, and whatever page I'm looking at, at least six songs immediately occur to me.

…

So, if you look at pretty much any of the songs, a lot of them are geographical, historical, and form a movie.</blockquote>
