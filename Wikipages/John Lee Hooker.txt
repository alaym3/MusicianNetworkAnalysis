'''John Lee Hooker''' (August 22, 1912<ref name="bare"/><!-- Do not change his year of birth unless agreed by discussion on the article talk page --> or 1917<ref name=dahl/><ref name=jlh>{{cite web|url=https://johnleehooker.com/about/|title=John Lee Hooker Biography|publisher=johnleehooker.com}}</ref> – June 21, 2001) was an American [[blues]] singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]], he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of [[Delta blues]]. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including [[talking blues]] and early North Mississippi [[Hill country blues]]. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s–1940s piano-derived [[boogie-woogie]]. Hooker was ranked 35 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s 2015 list of 100 greatest guitarists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-guitarists-153675/john-lee-hooker-4-152301/|title=Rolling Stones 100 greatest guitarists|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

Some of his best known songs include "[[Boogie Chillen']]" (1948), "[[Crawling King Snake]]" (1949), "[[Dimples (song)|Dimples]]" (1956), "[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]" (1962), and "[[One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer]]" (1966). Several of his later albums, including ''[[The Healer (album)|The Healer]]'' (1989), ''[[Mr. Lucky (John Lee Hooker album)|Mr. Lucky]]'' (1991), ''[[Chill Out (John Lee Hooker album)|Chill Out]]'' (1995), and ''[[Don't Look Back (John Lee Hooker album)|Don't Look Back]]'' (1997), were album chart successes in the U.S. and UK. ''The Healer'' (for the song "I'm In The Mood") and ''Chill Out'' (for the album) both earned him Grammy wins<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/32nd-annual-grammy-awards|title=32nd Annual GRAMMY Awards|date=January 15, 2013|website=Grammy.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/38th-annual-grammy-awards|title=38th Annual GRAMMY Awards|date=January 15, 2013|website=Grammy.com}}</ref> as well as ''Don't Look Back'', which went on to earn him a double-Grammy win for Best Traditional Blues Recording and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (with Van Morrison).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/40th-annual-grammy-awards|title=40th Annual GRAMMY Awards|date=January 15, 2013|website=Grammy.com}}</ref>

==Early life==
Hooker's date of birth is a subject of debate; the years 1912, 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have all been suggested.  Most official sources list 1917, though at times Hooker stated he was born in 1920.  Information found in the 1920 and 1930 censuses indicates that he was actually born in 1912.<ref name="bare"/>  In 2017, a series of events took place to celebrate the purported centenary of his birth.<ref>Brian McCollum, [http://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/05/01/john-lee-hooker-100th-centennial-tribute-grammy/101027412 "John Lee Hooker to get year-long 100th birthday tribute"], ''Detroit Free Press'', May 1, 2017.</ref> In the 1920 federal census, John Hooker is seven years old and one of nine children living with William and Minnie Hooker in [[Tutwiler, Mississippi]].

It is believed that he was born in Tutwiler, in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his birthplace was near [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in Coahoma County.<ref name="palmer"/> He was the youngest of the 11 children of William Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923),<ref>According to ''Boogie Man'', p. 24, "In 1928, Will Hooker Sr. and Jr. made a profit of twenty-eight dollars" from farming, making his death in 1923 impossible.</ref> a [[sharecropper]] and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c. 1880, date of death unknown). In the 1920 federal census,<ref>U.S. Census, Series T625, Roll 895, p. 235, in the city of Tutwiler, Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, Supervisor's District 2, Enumeration District 87, Sheet 29 A, Lines 18–19, enumerated February 3, 1920.</ref> William and Minnie were recorded as being 48 and 39 years old, respectively, which implies that Minnie was born about 1880, not 1875. She was said to have been a "decade or so younger" than her husband (''Boogie Man'', p.&nbsp;23), which gives additional credibility to this census record as evidence of Hooker's origins.

The Hooker children were [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]]. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the [[spirituals]] sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).<ref>Oliver, Paul. ''Conversation with the Blues''. p. 188. See also Bennett, Joe; Curwen, Trevor; Douse, Cliff. ''Guitar Facts''. p. 76.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

Moore was his first significant blues influence. He was a local blues guitarist who, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the [[Delta blues]] of the time.<ref name="palmer">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Palmer|year=1982|title=Deep Blues|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242 242–43]|isbn=0-14-006223-8|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242}}</ref>

Another influence was [[Tony Hollins]], who dated Hooker's sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were versions of "[[Crawlin' King Snake]]" and "[[Robert Petway#Catfish Blues|Catfish Blues]]".<ref>Murray, Charles Shaar (2011). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3I7PUE2lKS8C&pg=PP109&lpg=PP109&dq=%22Tony+Hollins%22+blues&source=bl&ots=Ej4vzrwNku&sig=RLqMw20iRJUsfZREm0ot8zUpujI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwih9uj6x-nPAhVGApoKHXyICBY4ChDoAQg4MAc#v=onepage&q=%22Tony%20Hollins%22%20&f=false ''Boogie Man: The Adventures of John Lee Hooker in the American Twentieth Century''], Canongate Books.<!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --></ref>

At the age of 14, Hooker ran away from home, reportedly never seeing his mother or stepfather again.<ref>''Boogie Man'' p. 43.</ref> In the mid-1930s, he lived in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he performed on [[Beale Street]], at [[the New Daisy Theatre]] and occasionally at house parties.<ref name="palmer"/>

He worked in factories in various cities during [[World War II]], eventually getting a job with the [[Ford Motor Company]] in [[Detroit]] in 1943. He frequented the blues clubs and bars on [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects|Hastings Street]], the heart of the black entertainment district, on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Hooker's popularity grew quickly as he performed in Detroit clubs, and, seeking an instrument louder than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.<ref name="oliver">{{cite book|first=Terry|last=Wogan|year=1984|title=Shoes Off the Record|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bluesoffrecordth00oliv/page/116 116–18]|isbn=0-306-80321-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bluesoffrecordth00oliv/page/116}}</ref>

==Earlier career==
Hooker was working as janitor in a Detroit steel mill when his recording career began in 1948,<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|year=1981|author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242 242]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/242}}</ref> when [[Modern Records]], based in Los Angeles, released a demo he had recorded for Bernie Besman in Detroit.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|year=1981|author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/243 243]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/243}}</ref> The single, "[[Boogie Chillen']]{{-"}}, became a hit and the best-selling [[race record]] of 1949.<ref name="palmer"/> Despite being illiterate,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hooker, John Lee {{!}} Detroit Historical Society|url=https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/hooker-john-lee|access-date=2020-10-30|website=detroithistorical.org}}</ref> Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting [[traditional blues verses|traditional blues lyrics]], he composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for [[Chess Records]] and [[Chance Records]] in 1951–1952), Johnny Lee (for [[De Luxe Records]] in 1953–1954), John Lee, John Lee Cooker,<ref>Liner notes. ''Alternative Boogie: Early Studio Recordings, 1948–1952''.</ref> Texas Slim, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar, Johnny Williams, and the Boogie Man.<ref>Leadbitter, M.; Slaven, N. (1987). ''Blues Records 1943–1970: A Selective Discography''. London: Record Information Services. pp. 579–95.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

His early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|year=1981|author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/244 244]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/244}}</ref> Hooker rarely played with a standard beat, but instead he changed tempo to fit the needs of the song. This often made it difficult to use backing musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.<ref>''Boogie Man'', p. 121.</ref>

For much of this period he recorded and toured with [[Eddie Kirkland]]. In Hooker's later sessions for [[Vee-Jay Records]] in Chicago, studio musicians accompanied him on most of his recordings, including [[Eddie Taylor]], who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies. "[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]" (1962)<ref>{{cite book|title=Deep Blues|author=Robert Palmer|year=1981|author-link=Robert Palmer (writer)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/245 245]|isbn=978-0-14-006223-6|url=https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/245}}</ref> and "[[Dimples (song)|Dimples]]", two popular songs by Hooker, were originally released by Vee-Jay.

==Later career==

Beginning in 1962, Hooker gained greater exposure when he toured Europe in the annual [[American Folk Blues Festival]].<ref name=dahl/>  His "Dimples" became a successful single on the [[UK Singles Charts]] in 1964, eight years after its first US release.<ref name="OCC"/> Hooker began to perform and record with [[Rock music|rock]] musicians.
