==Life and career ==
===Early career (1960s–1976)===
Parker was born in Hackney, East London, in 1950. He was a pupil at Chobham Secondary Modern School in Surrey. After the arrival of the [[Beatles]], Parker and some other 12/13-year-olds formed the Deepcut Three, soon renamed the Black Rockers. None of the members actually learned to play their instruments, however, and were merely dress-up bands, adopting Beatle haircuts, black jeans and polo neck sweaters. By the time Parker was 15 he was a fan of soul music, especially [[Otis Redding]], and would go to dance clubs in the nearby towns of [[Woking]] and [[Camberley]] where there was a thriving appreciation of [[soul music]], [[Motown]] and [[ska]]. Parker left school at 16 and went to work at the Animal Virus Research Institute in [[Pirbright]], Surrey, where he bred animals for [[foot-and-mouth disease]] research. At 18 he left the job and moved to [[Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]] where he took a variety of jobs, picking tomatoes, digging ditches, collecting money from pinball machines, and working in a bakery. In Guernsey he bought an acoustic guitar and began to learn fingerpicking style and began writing songs with lyrics heavily influenced by the psychedelic music of the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Parker returned to England for a year, living in [[Chichester]] in Sussex where he worked at the Chichester Rubber Glove Factory. By 1971, he had left England again and spent time in Paris right at the time of the [[Angela Davis#Arrest and trial|Free Angela Davis]] march through the city. From France, Parker hitchhiked through Spain to Morocco, where he travelled around for a year before moving to [[Gibraltar]]. In Gibraltar he worked on the docks unloading frozen foods, which he then helped deliver to supermarkets. His guitar playing and writing skills were improving, and after playing songs to a few locals in a bar, he found himself on an afternoon show on Gibraltar television where he performed two or three of his own songs. At that time, a strongly psychedelic influenced band named Pegasus often played in the same bar and asked Parker to join them. With Parker in the band playing a borrowed electric guitar, Pegasus played one show in Gibraltar before going to [[Tangier]], Morocco, where they briefly performed in a nightclub. Parker, however, was growing out of the hippie trappings and decided the band needed to learn a few songs that involved major keys (all the songs they played were in A minor) and so taught the members some of the soul numbers he had loved as a youth, including [[Wilson Pickett]]’s "[[In The Midnight Hour]]". He also tired of the band's hippie name and renamed them Terry Burbot's Magic Mud.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In late 1972, Parker returned to England and lived with his parents, working at a petrol station around the corner from his childhood home in [[Deepcut]]. By now he was determined to pursue a career in music and worked steadily on improving his guitar playing and song writing. In late 1974 he placed an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' seeking like-minded backing musicians. One of the musicians who answered the ad was Noel Brown, a guitarist who lived in south London. Brown introduced him to [[Paul Riley (musician)|Paul "Bassman" Riley]] who had recently been a member of [[Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers]]. (Brown also found Parker a gig at Southern Comfort, a tiny hamburger café on Seven Sisters Road in [[Finsbury Park (area)|Finsbury Park]], London where he played solo, performing a mixture of original songs and covers.) Riley thought Parker should meet [[Dave Robinson (music executive)|Dave Robinson]], the manager of the by now defunct [[Brinsley Schwarz]] band. Robinson had a small studio above the [[Hope and Anchor, Islington|Hope & Anchor]] pub in [[Islington]] and began to record Parker, sometimes solo and sometimes with a few musicians behind him.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=933}}</ref>

One of the songs Parker recorded was "Between You and Me."  This demo version ended up on Parker's first album, ''[[Howlin' Wind]]'', after the Rumour tried to record it but failed to achieve the natural feel of the demo. Another song, "Nothin's Gonna Pull Us Apart" was played, in demo form, on the [[Charlie Gillett]] show "Honky Tonk" on [[BBC London 94.9]].<ref name="Larkin"/> On hearing the song, Nigel Grainge from [[Phonogram Records]] called Gillett and asked who the new singer was. By now Robinson had become Parker's manager and a deal with Phonogram was struck. Robinson then went about recruiting the musicians who would become the Rumour, and recording for ''Howlin’ Wind'' began in the winter of 1975 with [[Nick Lowe]] producing. In 1975, he recorded a few [[demo (music)|demo tracks]] in London with Dave Robinson, who would shortly found [[Stiff Records]] and who connected Parker with his first backing band of note, [[The Rumour]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Parker had one track, "Back to Schooldays", released on the [[compilation album]], ''[[A Bunch of Stiff Records]]'' for Stiff Records.

In the summer of 1975, Parker joined ex-members of three British pub-rock bands to form [[Graham Parker and the Rumour]]: Parker (lead vocals, guitar) with [[Brinsley Schwarz (musician)|Brinsley Schwarz]] (lead guitar) and [[Bob Andrews (keyboardist)|Bob Andrews]] (keyboards) (both ex [[Brinsley Schwarz]]), [[Martin Belmont]] (rhythm guitar, ex [[Ducks Deluxe]]) and Andrew Bodnar (bass) and [[Steve Goulding]] (drums).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> They began in the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|British pub rock]] scene, often augmented at times by a four-man horn section known as The Rumour Horns: [[John Earle (musician)|John "Irish" Earle]] (saxophone), Chris Gower (trombone), Dick Hanson (trumpet), and Ray Beavis (saxophone).

The band's first album, ''Howlin' Wind'', was released to acclaim in April 1976 and was rapidly followed by the stylistically similar ''[[Heat Treatment]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> A mixture of rock, ballads, and reggae-influenced numbers, these albums reflected Parker's early influences and contained the songs which formed the core of Parker's live shows – "Black Honey", "Soul Shoes", "Lady Doctor", "Fool's Gold", and his early signature tune "Don't Ask Me Questions", which hit the Top 40 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

Establishing a recording career in early 1976, Parker preceded two other [[New wave music|new wave]] English singer-songwriters with whom he is often compared: [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]]. (Costello's first single was released in 1977, and Jackson's first solo single in late 1978).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===New direction (1977)===
Graham Parker and the Rumour appeared on [[BBC]] television's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1977, performing their version of [[The Trammps]]' "Hold Back the Night" from ''The Pink Parker'' [[Extended play|EP]], a Top 30 hit in the UK Singles Chart in March 1977.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> At this point, Parker began to change his songwriting style, hoping to break into the American market. The first fruits of this new direction appeared on ''[[Stick To Me]]'' (1977), which broke the Top 20 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Parker and the Rumour gained a following in Australia thanks to the support of community radio (4ZZZ, 3RRR), Sydney independent rock station [[Double Jay (radio network)|Double Jay]] (2JJ) and the ABC's weekly pop TV show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', which gave the group nationwide exposure. They made their first tour there in 1978, where they spotted rising Australian band [[The Sports]], who subsequently supported Parker and the Rumour on their early 1979 UK tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memorabletv.com/musicworld/ozrock/stot.htm |title=Australian Rock by Memorable Music |publisher=Memorabletv.com |date=1 June 1973 |access-date=21 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409121857/http://www.memorabletv.com/musicworld/ozrock/stot.htm |archive-date=9 April 2012  }}</ref> The group made a second Australian tour in late 1979, when Parker appeared on ''Countdown'' as a guest presenter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/tag/countdown |title=Countdown |publisher=TV Tonight |date=23 April 2012 |access-date=21 November 2012}}</ref>

===''Squeezing Out Sparks'' (1978–1979)===
An official Graham Parker and The Rumour live album, ''[[The Parkerilla]]'', issued in 1978, had nothing new:<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> three sides were live, with versions of previously released songs; the fourth was devoted to a "disco" remake of "Hey Lord, Don't Ask Me Questions". ''The Parkerilla'' satisfied his contractual obligation to [[Mercury Records]], freeing him to sign with Arista.<ref name="Larkin"/> Parker had long been dissatisfied with the performance of Mercury Records, finally issuing in 1979 as a single [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] "[[Mercury Poisoning]]" a song that directly attacked it. The flip side of the single was a cover of the Jackson Five song "I Want You Back (Alive)."<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Graham Parker and The Rumour were one of the four support acts for [[Bob Dylan]] at The Picnic at Blackbushe on 15 July 1978. The band also opened Richard Branson's new club [[The Venue (Victoria Street, London)|The Venue]], London, in November 1978.

Energized by his new label, [[Arista Records]], and with record producer [[Jack Nitzsche]], Parker wrote the songs that would form the basis for ''[[Squeezing Out Sparks]]'', widely held to be the best album of his career.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> For this album, The Rumour's brass section, prominent on all previous albums, was jettisoned.

''Squeezing Out Sparks'' (1979) was named by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' at No.&nbsp;335<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6599324 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227061921/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6599324 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 December 2004 |title=News |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=21 November 2012}}</ref> on its [[List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. In an early 1987 ''Rolling Stone'' list of their top 100 albums from 1967 to 1987, ''Squeezing Out Sparks'' was ranked at No.&nbsp;45, while ''Howlin' Wind'' came in at No.&nbsp;54.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coastal.edu/library/media/rs100.html |title=Kimbel Library: Media Collection – Rolling Stone Magazine's Top 100 Albums |publisher=Coastal.edu |access-date=21 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107180443/http://www.coastal.edu/library/media/rs100.html |archive-date=7 January 2013  }}</ref> The album features several of Parker's most famous songs, including "[[Passion Is No Ordinary Word]]", "[[You Can't Be Too Strong]]", and the singles "[[Local Girls]]", "[[Protection (Graham Parker song)|Protection]]", and "[[Discovering Japan]]". The companion live album ''Live Sparks'', was sent to US radio stations as part of a concerted promotional campaign.

The jettisoned brass section continued to play on other people's records, credited as The Irish Horns (on the album ''[[London Calling]]'' by [[The Clash]]) or The Rumour Brass, most notably on [[Katrina and the Waves]]' 1985 hit "[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking On Sunshine]]".

===The end of The Rumour (1980)===
Bob Andrews left The Rumour in early 1980, and was not officially replaced. However, in studio sessions for the next album, [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Danny Federici]] (of [[The E Street Band]]) played keyboards.

1980's ''The Up Escalator'' was Parker's highest-charting album in the UK,<ref name="Larkin"/> and was produced by [[Jimmy Iovine]]. The album featured the single "[[Stupefaction]]" and the track "[[Endless Night (Graham Parker song)|Endless Night]]", which had guest vocals from [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The front cover of the album credited only Graham Parker, not "Graham Parker and The Rumour".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The album was certified Gold in Canada (for over 50,000 copies sold).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum#!/gp_search=graham%20nash|title=Gold Platinum|publisher=Music Canada|access-date=1 March 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6iYPUE2rD?url=http://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum#!/gp_search=graham%20nash|archive-date=26 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

''The Up Escalator'' would prove to be Parker's last album with the Rumour until a reunion decades later.<ref name="Larkin"/> However, Rumour guitarist [[Brinsley Schwarz (musician)|Brinsley Schwarz]] reunited with Parker in 1983 and play on most of his albums through the decade's end.  Other Rumour members also played with Parker in later years:  bassist Andrew Bodnar would rejoin Parker from 1988 through the mid-1990s, and drummer [[Steve Goulding]] would play on Parker's 2001 album ''Deepcut To Nowhere''.

===Commercial success (1981–1990)===
The 1980s were Parker's most commercially successful years, with well-financed recordings and radio and video play. His follow-up to ''The Up Escalator'', 1982's ''Another Grey Area'', used [[session musician]]s [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Hugh McCracken]]. This album charted at UK No.&nbsp;40 and US No.&nbsp;51, and spun off a Top 50 UK single in "[[Temporary Beauty]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

1983's ''The Real Macaw'', with drumming by [[Gilson Lavis]] of [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] and Brinsley Schwarz on guitar, did not fare as well, hitting US No.&nbsp;59 on the album charts but missing the UK charts altogether. However, Parker's 1985 release ''Steady Nerves'' (credited to '''Graham Parker and The Shot''') was a moderate success and included his only US Top 40 hit "[[Wake Up (Next to You)]]". The Shot was a four-piece backing band, all of whom had played on either ''The Real Macaw'' or ''Another Grey Area'': Brinsley Schwarz (guitar), George Small (keyboards), Kevin Jenkins (bass) and Michael Braun (drums).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> ''Steady Nerves'' was recorded in New York City, and Parker began living mostly in the United States during this time.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Record label changes came quickly after the mid-1980s, partly accounting for the number of [[compilation album]]s in Graham Parker's discography. Particularly unproductive was Parker's tenure at [[Atlantic Records]], where he released nothing and signed to [[RCA Records]]. He began producing his own recordings and issued ''[[The Mona Lisa's Sister]]''. The backing band for this album included former Rumour-mates Schwarz and Bodnar; keyboardists James Hallawell and [[Steve Nieve]]; and drummer [[Terry Williams (drummer)|Terry Williams]] (replaced on one cut by Andy Duncan, and two others by [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]], who, like Nieve, was a member of [[Elvis Costello and the Attractions]]).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked ''The Mona Lisa's Sister'' at No.&nbsp;97 on its list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s.

===The 1990s===
Parker continued to record for RCA through the early 1990s. Long-time guitarist Schwarz once again left Parker after the 1990 album ''Human Soul''.<ref name="Larkin"/> Parker's 1991 offering, ''[[Struck by Lightning (album)|Struck By Lightning]]'', had Bodnar and [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]] in the backing band, as well as guest appearances from The Band's [[Garth Hudson]] on keyboards and [[John Sebastian]] on autoharp. However, the album's chart peak of US No.&nbsp;131 saw Parker dropped by the label. 1992's ''Burning Questions'' was released by [[Capitol Records]], who promptly dropped him after the album failed to sell.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

A 1994 Christmas-themed EP release (''Graham Parker's Christmas Cracker'') was issued on Dakota Arts Records, before Parker found a more permanent home on American independent label [[Razor & Tie]]. After the personal ''12 Haunted Episodes'',<ref name="Larkin"/> and 1996's ''Acid Bubblegum'' (featuring [[Jimmy Destri]] of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] on keyboards), Parker grew quiet in the late 1990s.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> However, he continued to play live fairly regularly, often working with backing band [[The Figgs]] (who, like The Rumour, when not backing Parker also issue records as a discrete unit).

===To the present===

[[File:Graham Parker-SXSW-20070316.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Parker at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]], 2007]]
Parker began a more active period in 2001, with the UK re-release of his early Rumour work, and with his third studio album for [[Razor & Tie]], ''Deepcut to Nowhere''. In 2003, he collaborated with [[Kate Pierson]] of [[the B-52's]] and [[Bill Janovitz]] of [[Buffalo Tom]] to record an album of lesser-known [[John Lennon]]/[[Paul McCartney]] compositions that had never been recorded by [[The Beatles]]. The album, called ''From a Window: Lost Songs of Lennon & McCartney'', was credited to "Pierson, Parker, Janovitz". Also in 2003, Parker contributed a solo acoustic version of [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Comfortably Numb]]" to the [[compilation album]], ''A Fair Forgery of Pink Floyd''.

New solo work continued with 2004's ''Your Country'', which saw Parker switch labels to Chicago-based indie [[Bloodshot Records]] and was co-produced by [[John Would]] at Stanley Recording in Venice, California. The album was recorded and mixed in two weeks.

''Songs of No Consequence'' was recorded with The Figgs in 2005. A show from the ensuing tour with the Figgs was broadcast on [[FM radio]] and released as an album in 2006. In March 2007, a new full-length album, ''Don't Tell Columbus'', was released.

In addition to his records, Parker published an illustrated science fiction novella, ''The Great Trouser Mystery'' in 1980. He published a set of short stories, ''Carp Fishing on Valium'', in June 2000. His third book, the novel ''The Other Life of Brian'', appeared in September 2003.

In early 2011, Parker reunited with all five original members of The Rumour to record a new album, ''Three Chords Good''. It was released in November 2012. [[Music journalism|Music journalist]], [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted that the release was "the rare reunion that simultaneously looks back while living in the present."<ref name="Three Chords Good">{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/three-chords-good-mw0002420812 |title=Three Chords Good – Graham Parker, Graham Parker & the Rumour : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=21 November 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Judd Apatow]] film ''[[This Is 40]]'', in which Parker and Rumour play themselves, was released a month later, in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfilmweb.com/2011/09/steve-goulding-graham-parker-mekons-music-documentary/ |title=Graham Parker and the Rumour are back, Judd Apatow's got 'em &#124; The Ask |publisher=Musicfilmweb.com |date=6 September 2011 |access-date=21 November 2012}}</ref>

The Parker/Rumour reunion continued into 2015, when their new album ''Mystery Glue'' was issued.  It was followed by a short international tour, after which the reunion ended.

In April 2018, Parker signed with 100% Records, and released a brand new single titled "Dreamin'". Later, in July 2018, Parker announced ''Cloud Symbols'', his brand new studio album to be released on 21 September 2018. The album features Parker's brand new backing band The Goldtops, which consists of Martin Belmont on guitar, Geraint Watkins on keyboards, Simon Edwards on bass, and Roy Dodds on drums. The album also features the Rumour Brass, making this their first appearance on a Graham Parker album since ''Stick to Me'' in 1977 and their first time working with Parker since the Squeezing Out Sparks tour in 1979. The album was initially to be produced by [[Neil Brockbank]], but he died during the recording of the album and production duties for the rest of the album were passed onto Tuck Nelson and Parker himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ItsGrahamParker/status/1021325709740998656 |title= Graham Parker on Twitter|publisher=twitter.com |date=23 July 2018 |access-date=28 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ItsGrahamParker/status/1044257419751231489 |title= Graham Parker on Twitter|publisher=twitter.com |date=24 September 2018 |access-date=28 September 2018}}</ref>

He announced a solo, acoustic 40th Anniversary version of ''Squeezing Out Sparks'', for an 13 April 2019 release.  It also contains the non-album single, "Mercury Poisoning".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2019/03/music-news-to-celebrate-its-40th-anniversary-graham-parkerhas-recorded-a-new-solo-acoustic-version-of-his-seminal-albumsqu.html|title=Graham Parker To Release Solo, Acoustic 40th Anniversary Version Of His 1979 Classic Album "Squeezing Out Sparks"|website=Music News Net}}</ref>
