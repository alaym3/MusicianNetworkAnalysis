==Career==
On 14 December 2009 Ebony uploaded her first cover onto YouTube which was a cover of [[Jason Derulo]]'s "Whatcha Say". As she began uploading an increasing amount of music covers her view count kept getting bigger and her fan base kept growing. 
By December the following year Ebony had racked up over 20,000 subscribers, this was when Ebony really started to create her own platform on the YouTube platform and began collaborating with other YouTube artists.

On 8 October Ebony uploaded a video letting her audience know that she was moving from England to Australia and began to collaborate with Australian musicians. Whilst in Australia Ebony reached 100,000 subscribers on her main YouTube channel.

In July she travelled to America to attend Teen Hoot, an event for up and coming artists. July also marked the first video in which Ebony collaborated with fellow British musician [[Shaun Reynolds (musician)|Shaun Reynolds]]. On 29 September of that year Ebony released her first EP The Beginning.

Late 2012 Ebony was short listed into MTV's Brand New Artist competition to win a chance to perform at their MTV showcase. In early 2013 Ebony was named the winner of the competition.

In September she posted the music video for her song 'Brush You off My heart' which is on her EP The Beginning.
