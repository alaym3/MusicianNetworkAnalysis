'''Daughter''' are an English [[indie folk]] trio. Fronted by [[North London]] native Elena Tonra (born 15 January 1990), the band was formed in 2010 after the addition of [[Swiss people|Swiss]] guitarist Igor Haefeli and drummer Remi Aguilella from [[France]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/24/daughter-pop-if-leave-letterman |title=One to watch: Daughter &#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date=2015-02-06 |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref> They have released four EPs and three albums, and are currently signed to [[Glassnote Records|Glassnote]] (North America) and [[4AD]] (Europe).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/2218596-Daughter-2 |title=Daughter (2) Discography |website=Discogs.com |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref> After playing the local London circuit, they toured supporting [[Ben Howard]] around Europe and have since played headlining tours around North America, Europe and Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songkick.com/artists/201667-daughter/ |title=Daughter Tickets, Tour Dates 2016 & Concerts – Songkick |website=Songkick.com |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref>

==Biography==
Of Irish–Italian parentage, Elena Tonra was raised in [[Northwood, London]]. Through her [[Dublin]]-born grandfather she experienced [[traditional Irish music]] from an early age. Her interest in music began when she received a copy of the album ''[[Grace (Jeff Buckley album)|Grace]]'' by [[Jeff Buckley]].<ref name="Scotsman2013">{{cite web|author=Aidan Smith |url=http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/british-band-daughter-on-matters-of-life-death-1-2818924 |title=British band Daughter on matters of life & death |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2013-03-03 |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref> After being bullied at school she used writing to "deal emotionally with life". Changing schools at the age of 12 had a great impact and since then Tonra writes "about things I feel difficult talking about in adulthood”.<ref name="Examiner">{{cite web|last=Power |first=Ed |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/artsvibe/the-first-lady-of-nu-folk-224412.html |title=The first lady of nu folk |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=2013-03-04 |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref>

Tonra began her career in music by performing acoustic shows under her own name around London. She found that this "didn't suit me at all. As a musician, I'm self-taught and felt I was restricted by my abilities".<ref name="Examiner" /> Haefeli attended one of the acoustic shows that Tonra was performing and found that "she had this power which drew everyone in".<ref name="Scotsman2013" /> Originally from [[Neuchâtel|Neuchatel]], Haefeli also attended London's [[The Institute of Contemporary Music Performance|Institute of Contemporary Music Performance]] where he met Tonra during a songwriting course.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Campion|first1=Freddie|title=Artist of the Week: Daughter’s Elena Tonra|url=http://www.vogue.com/873852/artist-of-the-week-daughters-elena-tonra/|website=Vogue.com/|publisher=Conde Naste|access-date=18 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129180546/http://www.vogue.com/873852/artist-of-the-week-daughters-elena-tonra/|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> They began performing together with Haefeli adding electric guitars.<ref name="Examiner" /> After their first demo started word of mouth on the band, Daughter self-released their debut EP, ''His Young Heart'', on 20 April 2011, recorded in Haefeli's bedsit.<ref name=MusicFeeds /> Later that same year, they released another EP, ''The Wild Youth'', on 2 October through artist-led [[Communion Music|Communion]] Records. The latter EP earned praise from British website For Folk's Sake who described Daughter as "one of the unique sounds in the pop landscape today."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forfolkssake.com/records/13448/ep-daughter-the-wild-youth|title=Daughter – The Wild Youth|publisher=For Folk's Sake|access-date=16 December 2012|date=28 November 2011}}</ref> [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Huw Stephens]] also invited them to perform a [[Maida Vale Studios|Maida Vale]] Session for his show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00km73j|title=Daughter in session at Maida Vale|publisher=BBC Radio 1|date=29 September 2011|access-date=16 December 2012}}</ref>

Tonra and Haefeli became romantically involved and the guitarist insisted that they "keep our couple life and our band life separate, [because] I don’t want Elena to stop saying things in her songs that are personal [as] songwriters need to be expansive and they need to be unafraid”.<ref name="Scotsman2013" /> While Tonra concurred with "Igor doesn’t question my lyrics. He regards what we do as an art form. He certainly doesn’t try to rewrite my words. I never tell anyone what my songs are about, not even him. I feel they are direct enough, anyway. They aren’t especially obscure".<ref name="Examiner" /> Tonra and Haefeli ended their relationship before the release of their album ''If You Leave'' in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/daughter-elena-tonra-interview-new-album-solo-exre-music-a8648726.html|title=Daughter's Elena Tonra: 'I attach my work to feeling unhappy'|date=2018-11-27|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>

In 2012, shortly after headlining a 700-capacity show in [[London]], Daughter announced their signing to UK label 4AD. Speaking of this, Elena commented "we couldn't be happier to be working with 4AD, a label that has released so many inspirational records and whose ethos we hold in very high regard. It really is a privilege."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://4ad.com/news/19/4/2012/daughtersignto4ad|title=Daughter Sign to 4AD|publisher=4AD|date=19 April 2012|access-date=16 December 2012}}</ref> Their first single proper, "Smother", was released in October of that year. It was playlisted by both BBC Radio 1 and [[6Music]], while being awarded Single of the Week by long-time supporter [[Huw Stephens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mnkq2|title=Killers live, Daughter on the phone, Huw lookalikes|publisher=BBC Radio 1|date=16 September 2012|access-date=16 December 2012}}</ref> In December 2012 the band appeared on the [[Late Show with David Letterman|David Letterman Show]] prior to the release of the record, which Tonra described as "perhaps (...) a cart-before-the-horse situation".<ref name="Examiner" />

===''If You Leave''===
The band released their debut album, [[If You Leave (album)|''If You Leave'']], in March 2013 (May in Norway). Charting at Number 16 in the UK, it was also received favourably in the press; "An album as beautifully conceived as ''If You Leave'' is one you follow from start to finish, riveted by the story it weaves and the emotion it bleeds. And in these digital days that feels like a remarkable achievement" ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' said in their 9/10 review,<ref>{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Billy |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/17527/reviews/4146174 |title=Album Review: Daughter - If You Leave / Releases / Releases // Drowned In Sound |website=Drownedinsound.com |date=2013-03-15 |access-date=2016-01-15 |archive-date=6 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206032013/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/17527/reviews/4146174 |url-status=dead }}</ref> while The Fly in a 4/5 album review said that it's "word-in-the-ear intimate and mountain-range massive".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Daughter 'If You Leave' review |url=http://www.the-fly.co.uk/reviews/album/1017415/daughter-if-you-leave/ |date=2013-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323163717/http://www.the-fly.co.uk/reviews/album/1017415/daughter-if-you-leave/ |website=thefly.co.uk |archive-date=23 March 2013 |url-status=unfit }}</ref> Daughter also won ''Independent Album of the Year'' for ''If You Leave'' at the 2013 AIM Independent Music Awards in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicindie.com/news/1333 |title=AIM Independent Music Awards 2013 - Winners Announced! - The Association of Independent Music |website=Musicindie.com |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref> The band began a lengthy tour in support of the album and recruited Luke Saunders as an additional live-member to ensure the material could be reproduced. As Haefeli explained: "He plays everything we can’t play, which is keyboards, bass and some more guitar. We were really happy with the result. It took quite a while and a lot of rehearsing, but we are really happy with how the songs sound live". The band also use a number of vocal and guitar effects to achieve this sound live.<ref name=MusicFeeds />

During the first two months of 2014, the band travelled to the Far East and [[Australasia]] for a number of headlining shows and as part of the [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival]].<ref name="MusicFeeds">{{cite web|last=Beaven |first=Rachelle |url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/features/daughter-talk-laneway-2014-incremental-success-album-number-two/ |title=Daughter Talk Laneway 2014, Incremental Success & Album Number Two |publisher=Music Feeds |date=2014-01-24 |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref> In April, Daughter supported [[The National (band)|The National]] on six North American tour dates,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Daughter To Headline Beacons, Further Festivals Announced|url = http://www.4ad.com/news/6/2/2014/daughtertoheadlinebeaconsfurtherfestivalsannounced|website = 4AD|access-date = 2016-01-15|date = 6 February 2014}}</ref> while they also announced the release of a ''4AD Sessions'' EP, a collaboration with composer [[Joe Duddell]].

===''Not to Disappear''===
In September 2014 the band indicated that they had started working on a follow-up at their own studio in London. Haefeli explained: "We've played so many shows that the first album became rockier on stage and we're playing with that dynamic".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nme.com/news/daughter/79540|title = Daughter discuss 'more extreme' new album|date = 3 September 2014|access-date =2016-01-15 |website = Nme.com|publisher = Time Inc (UK) ltd|last = Earls|first = John}}</ref> On 6 April 2015 Daughter announced they would be supporting Ben Howard on a short string of tour dates in the United States.

On 30 September 2015 the band announced that they would release the 10-track album ''[[Not to Disappear]]'' in 2016, while the first single "Doing the Right Thing" was made available as a music video.<ref>{{cite web|title = Daughter detail new album 'Not To Disappear', 'Doing The Right Thing' video|url = http://4ad.com/news/30/9/2015/daughterdetailnewalbumnottodisappeardoingtherightthingvideo|website = 4AD|access-date = 2015-09-30|date = 30 September 2015}}</ref> ''Not to Disappear'' was released by 4AD on 15 January 2016, preceded by the music video for second single "Numbers" in November 2015. On 28 July 2016 a music video for "No Care" was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZCZG5pwQGk|title=Daughter - No Care|last=DaughterVEVO|date=28 July 2016|access-date=4 June 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>

In a Guitar Magazine interview, Elena said: "We decided to have a little break, because we realised that we’d been together and working together for about eight years, so we decided it would be nice – in a friendly way! – to spend some time apart.” In 2021, Ex:Re released ''Ex:Re with 12 Ensemble'', a collaboration with composer [[Josephine Stephenson]] and the string orchestra 12 Ensemble. <ref name="exrewith12ensemble-announcement">{{cite news |title=Daughter’s Elena Tonra announces reinterpretation of solo debut album ‘Ex:Re' |url=https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/music/daughters-elena-tonra-announces-reinterpretation-of-solo-debut-album-exre-2882460 |access-date=2021-02-27 |work=NME}}</ref>
