==Background==
Speer and Johnson met in 2004 while playing in [[Rudy Rasmus]]' St. John's Methodist Church [[Gospel music|gospel]] band in Houston, Texas. The church employed Speer as the guitarist and Johnson as the organist.<ref>[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/01/22/khruangbin-con-todo-el-mundo-interview/https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/01/22/khruangbin-con-todo-el-mundo-interview/] {{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> “When we first started the band, we wanted to have a formula,” he says. “It’s like, ‘This is what we do, and we’re not gonna try and go outside the box too much. We’re gonna explore the box we’re in. I’ve always been a big fan of that. I used to be in bands where was like, ‘Man, we’ve gotta think outside the box!’ And all I’m thinking is: ‘You guys don’t even know.’ Music should never be just for the sake of being experimental. Before you even start, you have to know what you’re experimenting with first.” Speer said.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/khruangbin_chasing_the_eternal_sunrise/|title=Khruangbin: Chasing the Eternal Sunrise|date=January 26, 2018|website=Relix.com|access-date=2020-06-26}}</ref>

In 2007, Speer met Lee through friends, where they initially connected over a shared love of [[Afghan music]] and [[Middle Eastern architecture (disambiguation)|Middle Eastern architecture]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/01/khruangbins-feel-good-funk-is-undeniable.html|title=Khruangbin's Feel-Good Funk Is Undeniable|first=Margaret|last=Rhodes|website=Vulture.com}}</ref> In 2009, Lee started to learn the bass with guidance from Speer. After playing for six months, she auditioned and got the gig to be the bassist for Yppah on his upcoming tour. Speer already had the gig as guitarist for [[Yppah]] and had encouraged Lee to audition.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Marcus J. |title='Was It a Lost Psych-Funk Classic?

The tour motivated the two of them to make music together more seriously, leading them to form Khruangbin.<ref name="nighttimestories.co.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://nighttimestories.co.uk/release.php/?id=khruangbin-a-calf-born-in-winter|title=Night Time Stories - Release - Khruangbin – A Calf Born In Winter|website=Nighttimestories.co.uk}}</ref> Speer and Lee went to a barn where they developed the bass-heavy, [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] sound that became the basis of the band's aesthetic.<ref name="nighttimestories.co.uk"/> Upon their return, they asked Johnson to join the band as drummer, to play simple [[Breakbeat|break-beats]] under the guitar and bass.<ref name="premierguitar.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/27040-khruangbins-mark-speer-addicted-to-reverb|title=Khruangbin's Mark Speer: Addicted to Reverb|website=Premierguitar.com}}</ref> The barn, located in the 300-person town of [[Burton, Texas|Burton]], [[Burton, Texas|Texas]], would become the site of all future Khruangbin recording sessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/da/article/6x85p3/khruangbin-interview-the-universe-smiles-upon-you-premiere|title=How a Thai Funk, Surf Soul Trio Named Khruangbin Found Their Groove in a Texas Barn|date=November 4, 2015|website=Noisey.vice.com}}</ref> The band has a longterm working relationship with Houston-based engineer [[Steve Christensen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-christensen-mn0003268934|title=Steve Christensen {{!}} Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|language=en-us|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref>

When asked to play their first gig, Lee, who was learning to speak [[Thai language|Thai]] at the time, decided they should use her favorite Thai word "khruangbin" ({{lang-th|เครื่องบิน}}; {{RTGS|khrueang bin}}), which means "aeroplane", as their name.<ref name="auto1">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/11/new-band-of-the-week-khruangbin-no-70|title=New band of the week: Khruangbin (No 70)|first=Paul|last=Lester|date=September 11, 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Speer said that, had they had the foresight to predict the band's success, they might not have chosen a name that was so difficult to pronounce.<ref name="premierguitar.com"/> The band's name symbolizes the international set of influences that shaped the band's formation.<ref name="auto1"/>

A notable part of the band's visual style is the black wigs that Lee and Speer wear on stage, and during promotional interviews and photoshoots. Originally this was to help them move from the stage to the merchandise stand without being recognised during early tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coconuts.co/bangkok/lifestyle/interview-khruangbin-american-rock-music-under-the-influence-of-thai-molam/|title=Interview: Khruangbin, the band making American rock music under the influence of Thai molam|date=August 17, 2018|website=Coconuts.co}}</ref>

==Career==
After Khruangbin toured with [[Bonobo (musician)|Bonobo]], he featured their song 'Calf Born in Winter' on his 2014 ''[[Late Night Tales: Bonobo|Late Night Tales]]'' compilation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/6x85p3/khruangbin-interview-the-universe-smiles-upon-you-premiere|title=How a Thai Funk, Surf Soul Trio Named Khruangbin Found Their Groove in a Texas Barn|date=November 4, 2015|website=Noisey.vice.com}}</ref> The song became one of the most popular tracks on the record, helping create an initial audience<ref name="nighttimestories.co.uk"/> for the band's first EP, ''History of Flight'', and debut record, ''The Universe Smiles Upon You'', in 2015.<ref name="npr.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2018/01/26/580429575/khruangbins-vibrant-con-todo-el-mundo-is-drawn-from-life|title=Khruangbin's Vibrant 'Con Todo El Mundo' Is Drawn From Life|website=Npr.org}}</ref>

In January 2018, Khruangbin released their second album, ''Con Todo el Mundo''.<ref name="auto2"/> The title of the album came from Laura Lee's [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] grandfather, who would often ask, "How do you love me?" (''"¿Cómo me quieres?"'') and would only accept one response, ''"Con todo el mundo,"'' or in English, "with all the world."<ref name="npr.org"/>

The band said the title of the record is also a reference to the diverse range of musical influences that inspired it, primarily from the Middle East.<ref name="auto"/> Shortly before the release of ''Con Todo el Mundo'', the band also covered ''Ma Beham Nemiresim'' by [[Googoosh]], a popular [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] songstress, for the ''Artists Rise Against [[Islamophobia]]'' compilation,<ref>[https://floatinghouserecordings.bandcamp.com/track/ma-be-ham-nemiresim-googoosh-cover#]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and created a [[Tehran]]-specific playlist on [[Spotify]], in addition to many other city-specific playlists, as part of their ''AirKhruang'' DJ series.<ref name="billboard.com"/>

In 2018, Khruangbin recorded live for Spotify an arrangement of the Indian song ''Khuda Bhi Aasman Se'', played by [[Mohammed Rafi]] in the movie [[Dharti (1970 film)|Dharti]] (1970), a [[Bollywood]] movie classic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jambase.com/article/khruangbin-covers-khuda-bhi-aasman-se-spotify-singles|title=Khruangbin Covers ‘Khuda Bhi Aasman Se’ For ‘Spotify Singles’|website=JamBase.com|access-date=August 6, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/0SsFgST749MQC6oN9PLHLf|title=Spotify Singles|access-date=August 6, 2021|website=Open.spotify.com}}</ref>

They also opened for [[Leon Bridges]] on his recent 2018 tour, as well as [[Trey Anastasio]]'s Ghosts of the Forest tour in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegreekberkeley.com/events/trey-anastasio-ghosts-forest|title=Trey Anastasio Ghosts of the Forest &#124; Greek Theatre|website=Thegreekberkeley.com}}</ref> In 2020, the group was featured on the cover of ''Relix''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://relix.com/mordechai/|title=New Relix Issue ft.

In April 2020, Khruangbin announced they would release their third studio album, ''[[Mordechai (album)|Mordechai]],'' on June 26 via Dead Oceans and shared their lead single "Time (You & I)" <ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-28|title=Khruangbin Announce New Album, Share Lead Single "Time (You and I)"|url=https://hypebeast.com/2020/4/khruangbin-mordechai-album-announcement-time-you-and-i-music-video|access-date=2021-02-05|website=HYPEBEAST}}</ref>

On June 26, 2020, Khruangbin released ''Mordechai''. Laura Lee said the band wanted the album to sound like "the world, rather than any one particular part of the world,” with influences from West African, Indian, Vietnamese, German, Czech, Mexican and many more cultures.
