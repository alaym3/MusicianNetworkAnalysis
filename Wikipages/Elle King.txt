==Early life==
King was born on July 3, 1989<ref name=AXS>{{cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/the-top-10-best-elle-king-songs-90679 |title= The top 10 best Elle King songs |last=Wallace |first=Jeff |work=AXS |date= July 10, 2016 |access-date=July 15, 2018}}</ref><ref name=birthday>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/elle-king-posts-hopeful-message-28th-birthday/story?id=48425088|title=Elle King posts hopeful message on her 28th birthday|last=Tuccillo|first=Andrea|work=[[ABC News]]|date=July 3, 2017|access-date=July 15, 2018}}</ref> in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to then-''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Rob Schneider]]<ref name="glamour1">{{cite web|last=Weinberg |first=Jen |url=http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2012/07/elle-king-the-voice-behind-the.html|title=Elle King, the Voice Behind the Mob Wives Theme Song "Playing For Keeps" Talks to Us About True Blood, Pickle Backs, and Showgirls: Obsessed: Entertainment |website=Glamour.com |date=August 5, 2012 |access-date=September 7, 2012}}</ref> and London King, a former model. Her parents divorced and her mother remarried. She grew up living in Ohio, between [[Wellston, Ohio|Wellston]] and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. When she was nine, her stepfather, Justin Tesa,<ref name=imdbbio>{{cite web|title=Elle King – Biography|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0773792/bio|website=IMDb.com|access-date=February 22, 2015}}</ref> gave her a record by [[all-female band|all-female hard-rock band]] [[the Donnas]]; she views this as the pivotal moment when she decided she wanted to be a musician. Around this time, she also started listening to [[the Runaways]] and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], and she made her acting debut alongside her father in the movie ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]''.<ref name="vanityfair"/>

At the age of 13, King started playing guitar, immersing herself in the music of [[Otis Redding]], the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]], [[Etta James]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Al Green]], [[Hank Williams]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[AC/DC]] (she has the phrase "dirty deeds" tattooed on her biceps), and [[Earl Scruggs]].<ref name="vanityfair"/> Her interest in the [[Country music|country]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] of Hank Williams and Earl Scruggs inspired her to learn the banjo. During her teenage years, she attended [[Buck's Rock]] camp in Connecticut, where she starred successfully in a number of musicals.<ref name="glamour1"/>

King spent her teenage years in [[New York City]], but she has also lived in Los Angeles, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Upon graduating from [[Little Red School House|Elisabeth Irwin High School/Little Red School House]],<ref name=klaw>{{cite web|title='Catch of the Day' - Dierks Bentley ft Elle King|url=http://klaw.com/catch-of-the-day-dierks-bentley-ft-elle-king-different-for-girls-audio/|website=KLAW 101 - Oklahoma's Best Country|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> she moved to Philadelphia to matriculate at [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]], studying painting and film.<ref name=klaw /> During these college years, she had an artistic epiphany seeing a live show where the band onstage used a [[banjo]] purely for accompaniment purposes, eschewing the bluegrass and country musical vocabulary traditionally associated with the instrument. King then began to use the banjo as a compositional tool. After college, she briefly lived in Copenhagen and Los Angeles, before moving back to New York where she currently resides in [[Bushwick, Brooklyn]].<ref name="vanityfair"/>

==Career==

===1999–2013: Career beginnings===
In 1999, she debuted as an actress in her father's film ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]''.<ref name="klaw" /> In 2005, at age 16, she started gigging around New York City, using a fake ID to gain entry to the local nightclubs.<ref name="vanityfair" /> King immersed herself in the local songwriting scene and honed her performance skills by busking around town. King was then signed by newly appointed RCA Chairman Peter Edge.<ref name="cake">{{cite web|title=EP: Elle King's "The Elle King"|url=http://grungecake.com/ep-elle-kings-the-elle-king/articles/1196|website=Grungecake.com|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> Her debut single "Good To Be A Man", was released on March 13, 2012, as a [[Music download|digital download]] and also as a 7" vinyl single.<ref name="cake" /> On June 12, 2012, the four-song ''[[The Elle King EP]]'' was released on RCA.<ref name="cake" /> The EP was recorded in New York and was produced by Andy Baldwin and [[Chris DeStefano]], with King herself producing a track.
