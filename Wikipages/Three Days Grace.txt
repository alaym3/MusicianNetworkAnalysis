'''Three Days Grace''' is a Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Norwood, Ontario]] in 1997. The band's original iteration was called "Groundswell" and played in various local Norwood back-yard parties and area establishments from 1993 to 1996.

Based in [[Toronto]], the band's original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist [[Adam Gontier]], drummer and backing vocalist [[Neil Sanderson]], and bassist Brad Walst. In 2003, [[Barry Stock]] was recruited as the band's lead guitarist, making them a four-member band. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by [[My Darkest Days]]' vocalist Matt Walst, who is also the younger brother of Brad Walst.

Currently signed to [[RCA Records]], they have released six studio albums, each at three-year intervals: ''[[Three Days Grace (album)|Three Days Grace]]'' in 2003, ''[[One-X]]'' in 2006, ''[[Life Starts Now]]'' in 2009, ''[[Transit of Venus (album)|Transit of Venus]]'' in 2012, ''[[Human (Three Days Grace album)|Human]]'' in 2015, and ''[[Outsider (Three Days Grace album)|Outsider]]'' in 2018. The first three albums have been [[RIAA certified]] 2x platinum, 3x platinum, and platinum, respectively, in the United States. In Canada, they have been [[Music Canada#Certification-awards|certified by Music Canada]] as platinum, triple platinum, and double platinum, respectively. The band has had 15 No. 1 songs on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, and three No. 1 hits on [[Alternative Songs]].

=== Groundswell years and break-up (1992–1996) ===

The band has its origins as a five-piece band called "Groundswell", formed in [[Norwood, Ontario|Norwood]], Ontario, in 1992.<ref name="allmusic bio"/> Groundswell released one full-length album, ''Wave of Popular Feeling''. The band's line-up consisted of lead vocalist Adam Gontier, drummer Neil Sanderson, bassist Brad Walst, lead guitarist Phil Crowe, and rhythm guitarist Joe Grant. Most of the members were attending high school when the band formed.<ref name="allmusic bio">{{cite web | last=Sutton |first=Michael |title=Three Days Grace > Biography |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p561754|pure_url=yes}} |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=August 13, 2009}}</ref><ref name="New Faces" /> By the end of 1995, the band had broken up.

=== Early years (1997–2002) ===

In 1997, Gontier, Sanderson, and Walst regrouped as "Three Days Grace". According to Gontier, the name refers to a sense of urgency, with the question being whether someone could change something in their life if they had only three days to make a change.<ref name="flentertainment">{{cite web|url=http://www.floridaentertainmentscene.com/music/artists/three_days_grace/interview.htm |title=Interview with Adam Gontier of Three Days Grace |access-date=November 19, 2008 |last=Montes |first=Michael |year=2004 |publisher=Florida Entertainment Scene |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116054817/http://www.floridaentertainmentscene.com/music/artists/three_days_grace/interview.htm |archive-date=January 16, 2009 }}</ref> Once in Toronto, the band became acquainted with local producer Gavin Brown.

The record label wanted to hear more material, and with Brown producing, the band created the song, "[[I Hate Everything About You]]", which attracted the interest of several record labels.<ref name=maplemusic /> TDG were soon signed to [[Jive Records]] after being sought out by the company's president.<ref name="allmusic bio"/>

The band appeared as themselves in the 2004 film ''[[Raise Your Voice]],'' performing the songs "Are You Ready" and "Home".{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

=== ''One-X'' and Stock's arrival (2006–2008) ===
{{Main|One-X}}

The release of "I Hate Everything About You" was followed by two more single releases, "[[Just Like You (Three Days Grace song)|Just Like You]]" and "[[Home (Three Days Grace song)|Home]]".  About this time, Gontier developed an addiction to the prescription [[narcotic analgesic|drug]] [[OxyContin]]. After finishing the tour for their first album, the band knew they could not continue with the condition he was in, so in 2005, with the support of his family, friends, and band members, Gontier checked himself into the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] (CAMH) in Toronto. While in treatment, Gontier began writing lyrics for songs regarding how he felt and what he was going through in rehabilitation.<ref name="The Star">{{cite news |last=Wagner |first=Vit |title=Saving Grace |url=https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/124134 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=November 28, 2006 |access-date=October 19, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115200359/http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/124134 |archive-date=November 15, 2009  }}</ref>

[[Image:Adam Gontier at Buzz Bake Sale 2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The band at the Buzz Bake Sale in 2007]]
Gontier successfully completed treatment at CAMH. The band found a place suitable for further songwriting in [[Northern Ontario]], in a cottage where they experimented on, tested, and practiced new songs. After three months at the cottage, they had about finished what would be their second album. Gontier contributed lyrics about his experiences in rehab; the first single from ''[[One-X]]'', titled "[[Animal I Have Become]]", features lyrics Gontier had written while getting sober. The second album contained at least four more such songs, including "Over and Over", "Gone Forever", and the hit songs "[[Pain (Three Days Grace song)|Pain]]" and "[[Never Too Late (Three Days Grace song)|Never Too Late]]". In a 2006 interview, Gontier said that the album's material was more personal to him than the band's previous work because the inspiration had come out of his experiences with despondence, drug abuse, and rehab, which had constituted the past two years of his life.<ref name=revolver>{{cite journal |last=Kelley |first=Trevor |date=January 2007 |title=Three Days Grace |journal=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |issue=52 |pages=46–48 |issn=1527-408X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPoDAAAAMBAJ |access-date=August 13, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name=msnbc>{{cite news | title=Three Days Grace Singer Feels the Pain |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/three-days-grace-singer-feels-pain-wbna13106824 |publisher=[[Today.com]] |date=June 2, 2006 |access-date=August 13, 2009}}</ref>

''One-X'' was released on June 13, 2006<ref name=msnbc /> and marked [[Barry Stock]]'s first effort with the band.<ref name="allmusic bio" /> Gontier also performed live by himself at various rehabilitation centres as a "thank you" to the people who had helped him get through his addiction, and as an inspiration to others who were also dealing with addiction issues. In these performances, he would play songs such as "Pain", "Animal I Have Become", and "Never Too Late", to encourage and motivate people under treatment to overcome their addiction. Most, if not all, of these solo acoustic performances, called the "Three Days to Change" tour, took place simultaneously as Three Days Grace toured promoting ''One-X''. In November 2006, Gontier performed with the band at a special show at the CAMH in Toronto, where he had gone for his own rehab. The audience of about 250 people included patients, radio contest winners, family and friends of the band, and representatives from the band's label. Following the performance, Gontier did a 50-minute Q&A session which was filmed as part of the "Behind the Pain" documentary.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

''One-X'' was met with mostly positive reviews.
