'''Benedict Chiajulam Ihesiba Jr.''' (born April 23, 1992), better known by his stage name '''OG Maco''', is an American rapper from [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Diep|first=Eric|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2014/09/the-break-presents-og-maco/|title=The Break Presents: OG Maco – XXL|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=September 10, 2014|access-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref>
He is perhaps best known for his 2014 debut single "[[U Guessed It]]" which peaked at number 90 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/artist/6288957/og-maco/chart OG Maco] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved January 1, 2016.</ref> He is signed to [[Quality Control Music]] since August 31, 2014, which is managed by Coach K, the former manager of both [[Gucci Mane]] and [[Jeezy]] and signed to Capitol Music Group/Motown Records since May 20, 2015. He was also chosen as part of [[XXL (magazine)|''XXL'' magazine]]'s  "2015 Freshman Class".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/06/03/2015-xxl-freshman-class-revealed/|title=2015 XXL Freshman Class Revealed|publisher=BallerStatus.com|date=June 3, 2015}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Maco was born on April 23, 1992 in [[College Park, Georgia]]. He grew up with friends in a band named Dr. Doctor, in which he participated as a guitarist and singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps-g08fqa34|title=OG Maco – Everything You Need To Know|access-date=August 5, 2016}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
=== Influences ===
Maco cites [[Black Sabbath]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]] and [[Curren$y]] as major influences.<ref name="nobs">{{cite web|url=http://www.360nobs.com/2015/08/how-fetty-wap-vince-staples-and-dej-loaf-got-voted-into-the-xxl-freshman-10-list/|title=How Fetty Wap, Vince Staples And Dej Loaf Got Voted Into The 'XXL Freshman 10 List'|author=Ladi|website=360Nobs.com}}</ref>

=== Car crash ===
On July 28, 2016, OG Maco was in a near-fatal car crash. Maco suffered multiple skull fractures, cracked vertebrae, a broken orbital, heart palpitations, and almost lost his right eye.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/og-maco-reveals-he-lost-an-eye-in-recent-car-accident-news.23267.html|title=OG Maco Reveals He Lost An Eye In Recent Car Accident|website=HotNewHipHop.com|date=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theboombox.com/og-maco-loses-right-eye-after-terrible-car-accident/|title=OG Maco Loses Right Eye After Terrible Car Accident|first=Jacinta|last=Howard|website=Theboombox.com}}</ref>

Despite earlier reports, OG Maco never lost his right eye. His eyesight only became extremely distorted, so he had to wear an eye-patch during his subsequent recovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rap-up.com/2016/08/04/og-maco-loses-eye-in-car-accident/|title=OG Maco Loses Eye in Car Accident|website=Rap-up.com}}</ref> A few surgical procedures on OG Maco's right eye by his doctors has corrected the eyesight and has proven successful, and OG Maco is still able to see through it. Many earlier reports claimed doctors replaced his apparent blinded eye with a prosthetic one; although these reports were later found to be misinformation or false.

=== Flesh-eating disease ===
OG Maco was diagnosed by doctors as having a flesh eating disease known as [[necrotizing fasciitis]] which has left the rapper's face disfigured. OG Maco is currently taking antibiotics for treatment and hoping for a speedy recovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/03/og-maco-details-his-struggles-with-flesh-eating-disease|title=OG Maco Opens Up About Battles With Depression and Flesh-Eating Disease|website=Complex.com|language=en|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref>
