The band is signed to [[14th Floor Records]] and [[Bright Antenna]]. They have sold over 1 million albums worldwide.

Their debut studio album, ''[[A Guide to Love, Loss & Desperation]]'', was released in 2007 and featured some tracks first released on ''Girls, Boys and Marsupials''.

==History==
===Early years and debut album (2003–2008)===
[[File:The Wombats 2007 (1).jpg|thumb|right|The Wombats performing in 2007]]
The three band members met in 2003, while they were studying at the [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]]; they soon became friends and formed the band. Murphy and Haggis are Liverpool natives (the former from [[Woolton]] and the latter from [[Garston, Liverpool|Garston]]), while Tord is from the Norwegian city of [[Elverum]]. Over the course of 2004 to 2005, the band released many EPs such as ''The Hangover Sessions'', ''No.3'', and ''The Daring Adventures of Sgt. Wimbo and His Pet Otter''. Their first official release was ''Lost in the Post'', which was issued as a limited edition vinyl on 10 July 2006 on the London-based indie label KIDS Records and came with a distinctive additional second sleeve in the form of a [[FedEx]] ("WomEx") package. In 2006, the band's first album, ''[[Girls, Boys and Marsupials]]'', was released solely in Japan.

In January 2007, the band released a second limited edition vinyl on KIDS called ''[[Moving to New York]]'' (again featuring a second sleeve, this time in the style of a suitcase), then in May that year they released a third single on KIDS entitled "[[Backfire at the Disco]]", which reached No. 35 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. This was followed by the band's first full single after signing to 14th Floor Records, "[[Kill the Director]]", in late July. Their debut album, ''[[A Guide to Love, Loss & Desperation]]'', coincided with the release of "[[Let's Dance to Joy Division]]" (widely regarded as the band's [[signature song]]) in October 2007 and peaked at No. 11 on the UK Albums Chart. It was followed by a European tour ending with a Thanksgiving party at [[Carling Academy Liverpool|Liverpool Academy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The band started 2008 as the opening act at the opening ceremony of Liverpool's [[European Capital of Culture]] celebrations at [[Liverpool Arena]]. The single "Moving to New York" was re-released on 14 January 2008 and reached No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming their highest charting release to date. At the 2008 [[NME Awards]], the band was awarded "Best Dancefloor Filler" for their single "Let's Dance to Joy Division".<ref name="musicomh">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/nme-awards/34754 |title=Shockwaves NME Awards 2008: The Wombats win Best Dancefloor Filler |website=NME |date=28 February 2008 |access-date=13 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021041743/http://www.nme.com/news/nme-awards/34754 |archive-date=21 October 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
