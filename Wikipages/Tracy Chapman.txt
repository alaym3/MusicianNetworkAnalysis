In October 2018, Chapman sued the rapper [[Nicki Minaj]] over copyright infringement, alleging that Minaj had [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] her song "[[Baby Can I Hold You]]" without permission.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tracy Chapman sues Nicki Minaj over unauthorised sample|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/23/tracy-chapman-nicki-minaj-lawsuit|access-date=July 21, 2019|work=The Guardian|date=October 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719070236/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/23/tracy-chapman-nicki-minaj-lawsuit|archive-date=July 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Chapman's lawsuit alleged two counts of copyright infringement ((1) for creating the song; and (2) for distributing the song), requested an injunction to prevent Minaj releasing the song "Sorry", and stated that she had "repeatedly denied" permission for "Baby Can I Hold You" to be sampled. Chapman has a policy of declining all such requests, according to the lawsuit. In September 2020, District Court Judge [[Virginia A. Phillips]] ruled on Summary Judgment in favor of Minaj on the first count, stating that Minaj's experimentation with Chapman's song constitutes fair use rather than copyright infringement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/nicki-minaj-copyright-lawsuit-tracy-chapman-1234772693/|title=Judge Rules in Favor of Nicki Minaj in Tracy Chapman Copyright Dispute|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 16, 2020|first=Gene|last=Maddaus|access-date=September 18, 2020}}</ref> However, the Judge ruled that the second count should go to trial. In January 2021, the dispute was completely settled when Minaj paid Chapman $450,000 to avoid the pending trial over how the track had been leaked to radio host [[Funkmaster Flex]], who had played it on his radio show.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/nicki-minaj-tracy-chapman-copyright-lawsuit-sorry-b1784702.html|title=Nicki Minaj to pay Tracy Chapman $450k in 'Sorry' copyright infringement lawsuit|last=Brodsky|first=Rachel|work=[[The Independent]]|date=January 9, 2021|access-date=January 9, 2021}}</ref>
