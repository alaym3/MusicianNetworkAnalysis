'''Eyedea & Abilities''' (often abbreviated as '''E&A''') was an [[Music of the United States#Hip hop|American]] [[hip hop]] duo from [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]], consisting of rapper [[Eyedea]] and [[DJ Abilities]].<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=eyedea-abilities-p553533/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic history]</ref> The duo was founded in [[1999 in music|1999]] and became a prominent figure of the [[underground hip hop]] scene, becoming known for Eyedea's [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and socially conscious lyrics, along with DJ Abilities' dynamic experimental fusion of stylistic elements from both rap and [[rock music|rock]], as well as [[electronic music]]. The group was active until Eyedea's death in October 2010.

Over the course of just over a decade, the duo had collaborated with many well-known hip hop groups and artists such as [[Aesop Rock]] and [[Sage Francis]], playing a prominent role in the emerging underground rap movement. Eyedea's highly successful background work in [[Battle rap|rap battle]]s, along with his greatly introspective, complex and [[Poetry|poetic]] sense of lyrical integrity heavily influenced E&A's distinctive musical output and largely defined the group as a unique and stylistically independent presence within [[alternative hip hop]].

== Early beginnings ==
[[Eyedea]] first became known around the local [[midwest hip hop]] circuit for his [[Battle rap|battling]] and [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] skills. Eyedea was best known for his victory at the [[Blaze Battle]], which was aired on [[Home Box Office|HBO]] and hosted by [[KRS-One]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.citypages.com/music/eyedeas-five-greatest-freestyle-rap-battles-of-all-time-6617910|title=Eyedea's five greatest freestyle rap battles of all time {{!}} City Pages|last=Kangas|first=Chaz|website=City Pages|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref> Afterwards, Eyedea went on to tour as [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]] with [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]] and other [[Rhymesayers Entertainment|Rhymesayers]] crew. DJ Abilities was known for winning two [[Disco Mix Club|DMC]] awards and for his work on his [[mixtape]]s and [[1200 Hobos]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfstation.com/2012/08/08/dj-qa-dj-abilities/|title=DJ Q&A: DJ Abilities|website=SF Station – San Francisco's City Guide|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref>

== Musical career ==
Eyedea & Abilities made their jump from the battle scene with the release of their debut album ''[[First Born (Eyedea & Abilities album)|First Born]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/55613/Eyedea-and-Abilities-First-Born/|title=Eyedea and Abilities - First Born (album review ) {{!}} Sputnikmusic|website=www.sputnikmusic.com|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref>

Following a solo effort by Eyedea in 2002 under the name [[The Many Faces of Oliver Hart|Oliver Hart]], Eyedea and Abilities released ''[[E&A]]'' in 2004, which returned Eyedea back to his battle rapper roots, with Vish Khanna from [[Exclaim!]] giving it a favorable review, saying: "Eyedea is a pesky braggadocio, spitting out disses like a mouthy schoolyard bully cracking his crew up at your expense."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/eyedea_abilities-e|title=Eyedea & Abilities E & A|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en}}</ref>

Following ''E&A'', the duo went on an unannounced hiatus, bringing speculation that Eyedea & Abilities were no longer together. However, in August 2007, the duo announced via their [[Myspace|MySpace]] that they would be at the Twin Cities Celebration of Hip Hop performing old songs, as well as new material.

Eyedea & Abilities returned to the road in the Winter of 2007 with their 'Appetite For Distraction Tour'. Accompanied by fellow Minnesota artists [[Kristoff Krane]] and Sector7G, the tour was mainly on the west coast until the Spring of 2008 when the duo brought the 'Appetite For Distraction Tour' to listeners in east coast cities. The tour has garnered excitement from fans, as E&A had taken a four-year hiatus, and the duo's next album was one of the most anticipated among the independent hip hop scene. The album [[By the Throat (Eyedea & Abilities album)|''By the Throat'']] was released through [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]] on July 21, 2009.<ref>{{Citation|title=By The Throat by Eyedea & Abilities|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/by-the-throat/eyedea-abilities|accessdate=2017-02-18}}</ref>

In 2007, Eyedea created a book of poetry and art with painter Louis N. LaPierre, who is also responsible for Face Candy's 'This Is Where We Were' album art. The book was titled 'Once A Queen... Always A Creep'. Only 80 copies were made. It was on sale during Eyedea & Abilities 'Appetite For Distraction' Tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.louisnlapierre.com/portfolio/once-a-queen-always-a-creep/|title=…once a queen, always a creep. « Louis N LaPierre|last=onioneye|website=www.louisnlapierre.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref>

On October 16, 2010, Micheal Larsen's mother found him dead in his home as a result of an opiate toxicity. [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] officials ruled the opiate overdose accidental.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1652692/eyedea-died-of-accidental-drug-overdose/|title=Eyedea Died Of Accidental Drug Overdose|newspaper=MTV News|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en}}</ref>
