'''Opal''' was an [[Music of the United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] band in the 1980s. They were part of the [[Paisley Underground]] musical style.
The band's name is derived from "[[Opel (album)|Opel]]", a song by [[Syd Barrett]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bT9Dc3mzdZ8C&pg=PA16|title=Lysergic Garage Party|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|page=16|date=March 1989|volume=4|issue=12}}</ref>

The group formed in the mid-1980s under the name Clay Allison, featuring guitarist [[David Roback]] (previously of [[Rain Parade]]), bassist [[Kendra Smith]] (from [[Dream Syndicate]]) and drummer [[Keith Mitchell (musician)|Keith Mitchell]]. After one single, they released the remaining Clay Allison tracks under the band's new name, Opal, on the 1984 ''Fell from the Sun EP''. Another [[extended play|EP]], ''Northern Line'', followed in 1985. These EPs were later compiled and released as ''Early Recordings''.

''[[Happy Nightmare Baby]]'', Opal's first full-length album, was released in 1987. Smith left the group during the Happy Nightmare tour after a show in Providence, Rhode Island. Roback continued with vocalist [[Hope Sandoval]], playing shows as Opal and planning an album to be titled ''Ghost Highway'' but in 1989 this band became [[Mazzy Star]] and ''Ghost Highway'' was presumably released as ''[[She Hangs Brightly]]''.  Kendra Smith released a number of solo singles, EPs, and one album before retiring to the woods of northern California.

On their debut 1990 album ''The Comforts of Madness'' UK band [[Pale Saints]] included a cover version of the Opal song "Fell from the Sun". The 2020 reissue of that album included a more raw and earlier version of "Fell from the Sun" along with the original cover.

The song "She's a Diamond" was included in the film ''[[Boys Don't Cry (1999 film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' but was not included on the CD release of the [[film soundtrack]].

[[David Roback]] died on February 25, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/mazzy-stars-david-roback-dead-at-61/|title="Mazzy Star’s David Roback Dead at 61". Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=February 26, 2020}}</ref>
