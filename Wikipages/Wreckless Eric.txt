'''Eric Goulden''' (born 18 May 1954), known as '''Wreckless Eric''', is an English [[rock music|rock]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] singer-songwriter, best known for his 1977 single "[[Whole Wide World (song)|Whole Wide World]]" on [[Stiff Records]].  More than two decades after its release, the song was included in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine's list of the best punk rock singles of all time.<ref>Mojo (October 2001) – ''100 Punk Scorchers '', Issue 95, London;</ref> It was also acclaimed as one of the "top 40 singles of the alternative era 1975–2000".<ref>{{Cite book|title= ''Alternative Rock''|last= Thompson|first= Dave|year= 2000|publisher= Miller Freeman Books|location= San Francisco|page= 818}}</ref>

==Early life==
Wreckless Eric was born in [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]], East Sussex. He is a cousin of actress [[Gemma Arterton]] through her mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/men-of-the-year/home/winners-2010-unseen/gemma-arterton-exclusive-interview-and-photos/page/2|title=When GQ met Gemma Arterton|work=GQ|access-date=28 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031203524/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/men-of-the-year/home/winners-2010-unseen/gemma-arterton-exclusive-interview-and-photos/page/2|archive-date=31 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1973, he began attending Art School in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], where he joined bands such as Dirty Henry that played local clubs. On a break after his first year at school he saw [[Kilburn and the High Roads]] in [[Oldham]]. Struck by their honest approach to music, Eric decided to employ the same to his composing and performing. His next band, Addis and the Flip Tops, were the first incarnation of what would later be known as the DIY style. He first became known as one of the original members of the late 1970s Stiff Records artist roster, along with [[Ian Dury]], [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Nick Lowe]]. Eric's first appearance on [[music record|record]] was "Whole Wide World" on the Stiff label sampler ''[[A Bunch of Stiff Records]]'' in April 1977. The single version of that song was finally released in August. The song was produced by, and featured bass and guitar by Nick Lowe, with Steve Goulding on drums. The following month, the song was one of five tracks broadcast for the first of two sessions Eric recorded for DJ [[John Peel]] at [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/w/wrecklesseric/ |title=Radio 1 – Keeping It Peel – Wreckless Eric |publisher=BBC |date=25 September 1977 |access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref> The song went on to make number 47 in John Peel's '[[Festive Fifty]]', the so-called 'lost list' of 1977;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/festive50lists.htm |title=Rocklist.net...John Peel's Festive 50's – 1977 – 2003 |publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref> it was number 8 in the ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' critics' singles of the year; and it received an 'honourable mention' in the ''[[NME]]'' critics' chart.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The song's reputation has grown over the years and numerous bands have covered "Whole Wide World", such as the [[Lightning Seeds]], [[Mental As Anything]], [[The Monkees]] (on their ''[[Pool It!]]'' album in 1987), [[The Proclaimers]] (on their 2007 album ''[[Life With You]]''), [[Paul Westerberg]], and [[Cage the Elephant|Cage The Elephant]] (on their 2017 album ''[[Unpeeled (Cage the Elephant album)|Unpeeled]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/all/whole+wide+world|title=Search for "Whole Wide World"|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=21 June 2021}}</ref>

His debut album ''Wreckless Eric'' was a Top 50 hit in the [[UK Albums Chart]].  His second album with Stiff Records was ''[[The Wonderful World of Wreckless Eric]]''.

==End of Stiff days==
Eric became increasingly unhappy with Stiff Records' business ideas and promotion. The label forced Eric to work with songwriting teams, hired backing bands and assigned his music to unsympathetic producers. By 1980, shortly after the release of ''Big Smash!'', he decided to leave Stiff and record music at his home studio. Despite leaving the mainstream music business, he has continued writing songs and performing consistently throughout Europe and the United States. Since the 1980s Eric has released albums on numerous independent record labels.<ref name="Turnit">{{cite web|url=http://turnit-down.blogspot.com/2008/01/wreckless-eric-interview.html |title=Turn It Down: Wreckless Eric Interview! |publisher=Turnit-down.blogspot.com |date=8 January 2008 |access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref>

==Post-Stiff bands==
Eric's post-Stiff bands/projects include: The [[Captains of Industry (band)|Captains of Industry]], The Len Bright Combo, The Hitsville House Band, with one album ''Karaoke'' (1997) recorded under his real name, Eric Goulden.<ref name="Turnit"/>

==Post-Stiff albums==
In 1985, he released ''A Roomful of Monkeys'' with the Captains of Industry. It was followed in 1986 by a couple of homemade garage albums with 'The Len Bright Combo'. He always stayed in touch with [[Ian Dury]] and the [[Ian Dury and the Blockheads|Blockheads]] – two Blockheads, [[Norman Watt-Roy]] and [[Mick Gallagher]], were in the Captains of Industry.

In 1989, he signed to New Rose Records as Eric Goulden, released the homemade ''Le Beat Group Electrique'' with bassist André Barreau and drummer Catfish Truton. This same year he moved to France, in a quiet countryside corner where he stayed for about ten years. By the time he made this move to the vineyard country, he had already ended his "career of full-time alcoholic", that he referred to in his autobiography.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Eric toured Eastern Europe in a 1960s [[Peugeot]] car, both solo and with his band. In 1990, he released a second Le Beat Group Electrique album, recorded live in a New Rose record shop in Paris, entitled ''At the Shop'' with Eduardo Leal de la Gala and Fabrice Bertran on the drums. Together they formed the Hitsville House Band.

Eric returned to the UK in 1998, wrote his autobiography ''A Dysfunctional Success – The Wreckless Eric Manual'' about his life in England in the punk rock years and the music industry, ending at his departure for France. Eric contributed his version of "Clevor Trever" ''([[sic]])'' to the Ian Dury [[tribute album]] ''Brand New Boots and Panties'' released in 2001. A new album ''Bungalow Hi'' was home-recorded, produced and released in 2004.
