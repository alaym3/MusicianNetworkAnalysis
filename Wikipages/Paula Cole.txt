'''Paula Cole''' (born April 5, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter.  After gaining attention for her performances as a vocalist on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s 1993–1994 [[Secret World Live (film)|Secret World]] tour, she released her first album, ''[[Harbinger (Paula Cole album)|Harbinger]]'', which suffered from a lack of promotion due to the label, [[Imago Records]], folding shortly after its release.  Her second album, ''[[This Fire (album)|This Fire]]'' (1996), brought her worldwide acclaim, peaking at number 20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart and producing two hit singles, the triple-[[Grammy]] nominated "[[Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?]]", which reached the top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1997, and "[[I Don't Want to Wait]]", which was used as the theme song of the television show ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''.  She won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] in 1998.

Her third album, 1999's ''[[Amen (Paula Cole album)|Amen]]'', marked a major stylistic departure for Cole, and this alienated many of her former fans; the album sales were disappointing compared to the multi-Platinum sales of her prior effort.  She has since released several more albums, including the [[jazz]]-influenced ''[[Courage (Paula Cole album)|Courage]]'' (2007) and ''[[Ithaca (album)|Ithaca]]'' (2010), which marked a return to her 1990s [[folk-rock]] sound.  Her most recent release was titled ''American Quilt'', and came out in May 2021.  Besides recording and performing, Cole has also served on the faculty at [[Berklee College of Music]] since 2013.

==Early life==
Cole was raised in [[Rockport, Massachusetts]], United States; her mother, Stephanie Cole, a mixed media artist, was an elementary school art teacher, and her father, Jim Cole, was a professor of biology and ecology at [[Salem State College]], and he played bass in the [[polka]] band "Johnny Prytko and the Connecticut Hi-Tones".<ref name="Northshore">{{cite web |url=https://www.nshoremag.com/community-news/paula-cole/ |title=Paula Cole |work=Northshore Magazine |date=July 10, 2010 }}</ref><ref name= "Huffington">{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-bialas/kickstarting-over-paula-c_b_3089833.html | title=Kickstarting Over: Paula Cole Prepares Raven for Takeoff | work=Huffington Post | date = April 16, 2013 | author=Bialas, Michael}}</ref> Her older sister Irene played piano.<ref name="Northshore"/>

==Career==
===1993–1998: ''Harbinger'' and ''This Fire''===
Cole got her first big professional break when she was invited to perform on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s 1993–94 [[Secret World Live]] tour. To replace [[Sinead O'Connor]] who left the tour, Gabriel sought Cole on the strength of his impression of an early pre-release copy of her ''Harbinger'' project.<ref name=LATimes1997/> He left an [[answering machine]] message for her at her apartment in San Francisco, and she immediately flew to [[Mannheim, Germany]], for her only rehearsal with Gabriel, shortly before performing in front of 16,000 people.<ref name=RS2021>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/paula-cole-american-quilt-album-1143802/ |title=Paula Cole on New LP ‘American Quilt,’ What She Learned From Emmylou Harris |date=March 19, 2021 |last=Martoccio |first=Angie |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 22, 2021}}</ref>

Cole joined the two last legs of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s 1993–94 Secret World tour.<ref name="sing365">{{cite web |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paula-Cole-Biography/3E9D9A28FAB415AB4825696A0026C428 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110091749/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paula-Cole-Biography/3E9D9A28FAB415AB4825696A0026C428 |title=Paula Cole Biography |website=Sing365.com |archive-date=January 10, 2014 |access-date=January 9, 2014}}</ref><ref name="nndbmapper">{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/402/000095117 |title=Paula Cole |website=NNDB Mapper |access-date=January 9, 2014}}</ref> A video of the concert was shot just days after Cole joined the tour.<ref name=RS2021/> The video was released as [[Secret World Live (film)|''Secret World Live'']], with Cole covering all the primary female vocals and featured in duets with Gabriel, especially the songs "[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]" on which she sang the part that [[Kate Bush]] recorded with Gabriel in 1986, and "[[Blood of Eden]]" recorded by Gabriel and [[Sinéad O'Connor]] in 1992. The film received the 1996 [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111109/awards |title=Peter Gabriel's Secret World – Awards |website=IMDb}}</ref> Cole was also the main female vocalist on ''[[Secret World Live]]'', the audio album documenting the tour. The tour gave Cole international exposure as well as experience performing on a large stage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427233/paula-cole-picks-up-tips-from-peter-gabriel.jhtml |title=Paula Cole Picks Up Tips From Peter Gabriel |work=MTV |date=April 9, 1997 |access-date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>

Shortly after the tour, Cole released her first album ''[[Harbinger (Paula Cole album)|Harbinger]]'' in 1994.  She appeared with [[Melissa Etheridge]] to sing a duet on [[VH1]]. Imago Records went out of business a few months after the album came out. In 1995, Cole signed on to [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Warner reissued ''Harbinger'' in the autumn of 1995.

''Harbinger'' featured songs dwelling on Cole's personal thoughts on [[discrimination]] and unhappiness.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The songs were musically lush but driven and bleak. The accompanying artwork featured photographs of Cole with a boyishly short haircut, wearing loose fitting black sweatclothes, combat boots and [[body piercing|nose ring]]. The Imago label folded and promotion of ''Harbinger'' was limited, affecting its sales.<ref name=AllMusic/> A single, "I Am So Ordinary", was released with a black-and-white video that reflected the album's artwork.

In late 1996, Cole released her second album on Warner, ''[[This Fire (album)|This Fire]]'', which was entirely self-produced. The album's debut single, "[[Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?]]", went to No. 8 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's pop chart. The follow-up single "[[I Don't Want to Wait]]" reached No. 11, its popularity bolstered by its use as the theme song for the hit teen drama series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' which debuted over a year after the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/music-90sgirls/33/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726122618/http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/music-90sgirls/33/ |title=Paula Cole: Then {{!}} '90s Alternative Girls: Then & Now |website=Xfinity |archive-date=July 26, 2012}}</ref> The single "Me" (No. 35 Airplay chart) was also released as a radio-only single. The title "Hush, Hush, Hush", a duet with [[Peter Gabriel]], talks about AIDS and about a young man dying in his father's comforting arms. "Feelin' Love" was a single that was included on the soundtrack to ''[[City of Angels: Music from the Motion Picture|City of Angels]]''.

Cole was a featured artist on [[Sarah McLachlan]]'s [[Lilith Fair]] during its prototype year, 1996, and for the major tours of 1997 and 1998. She was nominated for several [[Grammy Award]]s in 1997. Among them was "Producer of the Year" (Cole was the third woman to ever be nominated in this category after [[Janet Jackson]] in 1990 and [[Mariah Carey]] in 1992); she did not win, but she did go on to win "Best New Artist" that same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-02-10/features/1998041108_1_paula-cole-cole-admits-cowboys |title=Don't Fence Her In Singer Paula Cole and "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?" have been branded as anti-feminist.

===1999–2006: ''Amen'', hiatus, and motherhood===
{{main|Amen (Paula Cole album)}}
Cole took a hiatus to raise her daughter, Sky. In 1999 Cole released ''Amen'' with the newly formed Paula Cole Band. The album's debut single "I Believe In Love" was initially not a success but was remixed by producer [[Jonathan Peters]] into a successful dance song. The song "Amen" was featured and performed by Paula and the band at P3 on the hit TV show ''[[Charmed]]'' in 2000. The album which had guest appearances by [[DJ Premier]] and long-time Cole fan [[Tionne Watkins]] featured some R&B and hip-hop influences but failed to match the success of ''This Fire''. A fourth album was recorded with [[Hugh Padgham]] but the label refused to release it; in 2005 Cole uploaded one of the tracks, "[[Singing Out My Life]]", to her own website to get her sound heard. She also recorded a song called "It's My Life" during these sessions, which can be heard in [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] automobile commercials. Cole also made a home recording of a song protesting President Bush and the [[Iraq War]] titled "My Hero, Mr. President!", which she posted on her website.<ref>The song is available at:{{ulist |{{cite AV media |last=Cole |first=Paula |title=My Hero, Mr. President! |medium=Audio recording |url=http://www.paulacole.com/multimedia/audio/MyHeroMrPresident.mp3 |format=MP3 |publication-date=January 30, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041025165946/http://www.paulacole.com/multimedia/audio/MyHeroMrPresident.mp3 |archive-date=October 25, 2004 |url-status=dead }}}} Cole discussed it in subsequent blog posts: {{ulist |{{cite web |last=Cole |first=Paula |title=Paula's Thoughts on 'My Hero, Mr. President!' |date=February 3, 2003 |website=PaulaCole.com |department=Musings (blog) |url=http://paulacole.com/news/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009131146/http://paulacole.com/news/index.html |archive-date=October 9, 2004 |url-status=dead }} |{{cite web |last=Cole |first=Paula |title=News and Views from Paula |date=February 24, 2003 |website=PaulaCole.com |department=Musings (blog) |url=http://paulacole.com/news/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009131146/http://paulacole.com/news/index.html |archive-date=October 9, 2004 |url-status=dead }}}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Wiemann |first=Dirk |title=Off the Record: Pop Music and the War on Iraq |editor-last1=Angermüller |editor-first1=Johannes |editor-link1=Johannes Angermuller |editor-last2=Wiemann |editor-first2=Dirk |editor-last3=Kollmorgen |editor-first3=Raj |editor-last4=Meyer |editor-first4=Jörg |encyclopedia=Reflexive Representations: Politics, Hegemony, and Discourse in Global Capitalism |publisher=[[LIT Verlag]] |date=2004 |pages=111–112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZqx9GGI77MC&pg=PA111|isbn=9783825872380 }}</ref>

===2007–2013: ''Courage'', ''Ithaca'', and ''Raven''===
Cole returned in June 2007 with her fourth studio album ''Courage'', which was released on [[Decca Records]] and produced by [[Bobby Colomby]] at the Capitol Studios in Hollywood.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Cole's fifth studio album, ''Ithaca'', was released September 21, 2010. She wrote and co-produced all of the songs on the album. Cole says it "represents that inner fortitude and the journey I've been on."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/10/16/with_a_more_balanced_life_paula_cole_is_ready_for_a_return_to_spotlight/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+Top+arts+and+entertainment+news |title=With a balanced life, Cole is ready to return to the spotlight |work=Washington Post |date=October 16, 2009 |access-date=January 23, 2010 |author=McLaughlin, Moira E.}}</ref>

''Raven'' is Cole's sixth studio album. It was funded by a [[Kickstarter]] campaign which ran from September 22 to October 29, 2012, and raised $75,258.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paulacole/paula-cole-new-independent-album-raven-0 |title=Paula Cole: New Independent Album, "Raven" |website=KickStarter}}</ref> The album was released on April 23, 2013 on her 675 label. Cole wrote the 11 songs on the album including two from early in her career, "Imaginary Man" and "Manitoba".

The musicians included co-producer/drummer Ben Wittman, guitarist Kevin Barry and bassist [[Tony Levin]]. She has worked with Wittman and Barry since she was 19.<ref name=raven/>

===2014–2018: ''7'', ''This Bright Red Feeling'', and ''Ballads''===
''7'' is Cole's seventh studio album released on March 23, 2015, via Cole's website and to other digital music outlets on April 10, 2015. In Cole's words, it is "a collection of songs that came suddenly and urgently. The songs demanded to be written and released, as if my subconscious needed to reach out to me; to tell me what it thought about all I was going through. I recorded this album live, as an acoustic quartet. It sounds like a soft, soulful album made in the 1960s and the songs speak for themselves."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Simmons |first1=Christopher |title=Paula Cole announces new album release, '7' – a soft and soulful review of a 7 year life cycle |url=https://musewire.com/paula-cole-announces-new-album-release-7-a-soft-and-soulful-review-of-a-7-year-life-cycle/ |website=Musewire |publisher=Neotrope |access-date=14 May 2019|date=2015-03-22 }}</ref>

Cole announced that she was selling her new live album ''This Bright Red Feeling'' exclusively on CD at live shows and at her website, with intentions to put it online for digital sale soon. The album is a recording of her live New York City show on May 1, 2016, but also includes re-recordings of two of her biggest commercial hits. The album's title comes from a lyric from her song ''Tiger''.

Cole announced a new [[Kickstarter]] project on June 16, 2016, for a covers studio album, ''Ballads''. It raised $76,899. The album was released on August 11, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/premieres/paula-cole-sings-bobbie-gentry-hear-billie-joe-cover-w491363|title=Hear Paula Cole's Swampy Cover of Bobbie Gentry's 'Ode to Billie Joe'|work=Rolling Stone|date=July 7, 2017|access-date=August 18, 2017|author=Betts, Stephen L.}}</ref> The first single, a cover of [[Billie Holiday]]'s "[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]", was released on June 1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7816665/paula-cole-billie-holiday-god-bless-the-child-cover-listen|title=Paula Cole Covers Billie Holiday's 'God Bless the Child': Exclusive|work=Billboard|date=June 1, 2017|access-date=June 2, 2017|author=Bell, Sadie}}</ref>

===2019: ''Revolution''===
Paula Cole released her ninth studio album, ''Revolution'', on September 13, 2019, on 675 Records.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/paula-cole-revolution-review-2640276531.html |title=Paula Cole's 'Revolution' Is As Fresh and Vibrant As a Debut Album |website=PopMatters.com |date=September 13, 2019 |access-date=September 17, 2019 |author=Donovan, Charles}}</ref>

===2021: ''American Quilt''===
An article from [[The Independent]] has stated that Paula is due to release a new studio album, in 2021, titled 'American Quilt'. The same article detailed streaming issues with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', and the initial omission of "I Don't Want To Wait" as the original theme. Ostensibly the entire issue boils down to money, and attempted cost-saving at [[Warner Bros Television]]. Paula announced in January 2021 that a "verbal agreement" has been reached for the use of Cole's re-recorded version of the theme, taken from ''This Bright Red Feeling''.

==Other activities==
Cole performed a two-hour set at [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee]] Performance Center in Boston, Massachusetts on February 16, 2007, during which she debuted several songs from her upcoming fourth studio album, ''[[Courage (Paula Cole album)|Courage]]''. The set began with a solo piano version of "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?", which was replayed by the full band toward the end of the concert. Her performance was reviewed favorably in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' on February 19, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/02/19/returning_to_the_limelight_cole_is_as_striking_as_ever/ |date=February 19, 2007 |title=Returning to the limelight, Cole is as striking as ever |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |department=Living/Arts |author=Rodman, Sarah}}</ref> In March 2007, her official [[MySpace]] page previewed three new songs from ''Courage'': "Comin' Down", "El Greco", and the album's first single, entitled "14".
