== Early life ==
Born in the [[List of neighborhoods of Madrid|neighbourhood]] of [[Opañel]] in [[Carabanchel]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://indiehoy.com/listas/7-raperos-que-tocaran-en-el-lollapalooza-2020-argentina/ |title=7 raperos que tocarán en el Lollapalooza Argentina 2020 |last=Rivarola |first=Maximiliano |date=29 February 2020 |website=indiehoy.com |language=es |access-date=5 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.elmundo.es/metropoli/musica/2019/04/29/5cc5e102fdddfff83a8b4672.html |title=Kaydy Cain: el Bad Bunny de Carabanchel |last=Fajardo |first=José |date=29 April 2019 |website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|elmundo.es]] |language=es |access-date=5 March 2021}}</ref> a [[Districts of Madrid|district]] in the south western suburbs of [[Madrid]], Gómez lived a humble life as a teenager. The environment which he calls 'El [[Barrio]]', indicating that in the neighbourhood it is normal for 15 to 20 year olds to have to go out to the streets to sell drugs, or whatever is illegal (referring to his lifestyle in adolescence). Thanks to the emergence of the [[Urban contemporary|urban genre]] worldwide, he managed to leave that lifestyle and dedicate himself completely to his passion for music.<ref name="BM" />

== Career ==
Dani Gómez began his artistic journey in the 2010s as a member of the trap group Pxxr Gvng, with which he was able to turn his life around thanks to the popularity that [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] began to enjoy in Spain, which allowed him to be part of the group's album {{lang|es|Los Pobres}} (2015), before launching his solo career. Influenced by the [[Atlanta]] hip hop flair of rappers like [[Gucci Mane]] and [[Waka Flocka Flame]], as well as the salsa artist [[Héctor Lavoe]], Gómez has built a massive following with his dynamic mix of hip hop, [[reggaeton]] and [[Bachata (music)|bachata]]. All these influences not only keep a strong presence in his beats and in his musical proposals, but they are also part of his personal life since he has several of his [[Pop icon|icons]] tattooed on his skin, such as [[Camarón de la Isla|Camarón]], Héctor Lavoe, [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] or [[Cano Estremera]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ismorbo.com/kaydy-cain-en-riot-a-donde-sueno-llegar-ya-he-llegado/ |title=KAYDY CAIN: "A donde sueño llegar, ya he llegado" |last=Turmero |first=Carlos |date=5 February 2021 |website=ismorbo.com |language=es |access-date=5 March 2021}}</ref>

Gómez began to pursue his solo career in 2017. His solo album {{lang|es|Calle Amor}} was released in mid-2017, in which he put trap aside to give way to a more [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[List of Caribbean music genres|Caribbean]] style. The lyrics of the 18 songs of ''Calle Amor'' express the street lifestyle, making references to fights, drugs, prostitution, among other details.<ref name="BM" /> The music video for '{{lang|es|Perdedores del barrio|italic=no}}' was the most watched video clip in Spain at the end of October 2017. Since its release, it has been indicated that the song is a direct attack on the Spanish urban music singer [[C. Tangana]], who precisely at that time was number 1 on the country's streaming charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jenesaispop.com/2017/10/27/311805/videoclip-mas-visto-espana-beef-kaydy-cain-c-tangana-perdedores-del-barrio/ |title=El videoclip más visto en España es un beef de Kaydy Cain a C. Tangana, ‘Perdedores del barrio’ |last=Alonso |first=Sebas E. |date=27 October 2017 |website=jenesaispop.com |language=es |access-date=5 March 2021}}</ref>

In 2018 Gómez released two singles 'Puro malianteo' and 'No Dreams', which quickly obtained hundreds of views on YouTube. The following year he released two albums, {{lang|es|Lo mejor de lo peor}} and ''NBA'', respectively, which became a massive hit on the music scene in Spain.<ref name="BM" />
