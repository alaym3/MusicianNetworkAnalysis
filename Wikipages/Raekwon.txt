==Music career==
===Wu-Tang Clan===
{{Main|Wu-Tang Clan}}
Before Woods joined the Wu-Tang Clan his rap name was Sha Raider. Woods joined Wu-Tang Clan, an originally nine-member hip-hop group that later added rapper [[Cappadonna]], based in the [[Staten Island]] and Brooklyn borough of [[New York City]], in 1992. He performed under the stage name '''Raekwon The Chef''' as well as the aliases Shallah Raekwon, Louis Rich and Lex Diamonds.<ref name="WTC allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p143661/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Wu-Tang Clan biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author2=Prato, Greg|year=2007|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2009-09-18}}</ref> Wu-Tang Clan debuted one year later with ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]''.

===''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...''===
In 1994, Raekwon signed a solo deal with [[Loud Records]] and released his debut single "[[Heaven & Hell (Raekwon song)|Heaven & Hell]]" for the soundtrack to the film ''[[Fresh (1994 film)|Fresh]]''. His first solo LP, ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'', was released August 1, 1995 to rave reviews, though not to as much commercial success as fellow Wu-Tang member [[Method Man]]'s ''[[Tical (album)|Tical]]''.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=p144748/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Raekwon profile|last=Huey|first=Steve|year=2002|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2009-09-18}}</ref> Nonetheless, the album was immediately deemed a hip-hop classic.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/raekwon-only-built-4-cuban-linx-25th-anniversary-vinyl-instrumentals-1035708/|title= Raekwon to Release 'Only Built 4 Cuban Linx' Instrumentals for Debut LP's 25th Anniversary|first=Jon|last=Blistein|date=July 29, 2020}}</ref> According to Steve Huey of [[AllMusic]], "''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' contained a narrative album format revolving around cocaine trafficking, criminal activity, and a rise through the ranks of the illegal industry."

Raekwon insists ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...''' was aimed at listeners who could relate to the underground, street culture. In an interview with HipHop DX, Raekwon said, "This album was just the definition of everything that was in front of us. So where we was trying to go, we was trying to get out the hood. We wanted to buy the most expensive cars and jewelry and different things like that. So that's why I guess I always call the album... ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' because it was only built for a certain lifestyle or people that understood that language. But eventually, it would break off to people looking at it as a movie and respecting it saying, ‘Yo, wow! This is authentic. This is something that never been done before’...So, I just wanted to give the world something that they could feel is brand new, it's different, but it's real." ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...'' debuted at No. 4 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] 200 chart and No. 2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It sold roughly 130,000 copies the first week - eventually certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]] in October 1995, two months after its release.<ref name="hiphopdx.com">{{cite web|url= https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.57118/title.raekwon-announces-only-built-for-cuban-linx-3-album-as-original-turns-25|title=Raekwon Announces 'Only Built For Cuban Linx 3' Album As Original Turns 25|date=August 1, 2020}}</ref>

===''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II''===
[[File:Rae gotta get a plate now.JPG|thumb|left|150x150px|Raekwon in 2008.]]
Raekwon planned to release the long-delayed sequel to his debut, ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II]]'' in 2007 through [[Aftermath Entertainment]]. The album was informally executively produced by [[Busta Rhymes]], whom Raekwon cited as getting him in the "''Cuban Linx'' mindset", and [[RZA]], with RZA handling most of the production. [[Dr. Dre]], [[Scram Jones]], and [[J Dilla]] were other producers that were announced early on as working on the album. RZA explained the collaboration between him and Dr. Dre as "yin and yang" when it came to their styles. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Raekwon and EMI both confirmed at one point that ''Only Built For Cuban Linx... Pt. II'' would be released in the summer of 2009 with EMI serving as the distribution label for the album, which was officially released on Raekwon's ICE H<sub>2</sub>O label. However, Raekwon and EMI later announced that the album would be pushed back to September 8, 2009 due to sample clearance issues, and the leak of a song from the album entitled "Surgical Gloves."<ref name="New Release Date">{{cite web|url=http://www.welivethis.com/newsfeed/2009/07/01/raekwon-pushes-built-4-cuban-linx-ii-september-8-2009|title=Raekwon pushes back Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II album release date to September 8, 2009|work=WeLiveThis.com|access-date=July 1, 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707082930/http://www.welivethis.com/newsfeed/2009/07/01/raekwon-pushes-built-4-cuban-linx-ii-september-8-2009/|archive-date=July 7, 2009}}</ref>

On September 8, 2009, ''Only Built For Cuban Linx... Pt. II'' was released after many delays. The album features many Wu-Tang members and affiliates, as well as [[Slick Rick]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Beanie Sigel]] and more. On September 28, 2009, Raekwon was named the #10 Hottest MC in the game by [[MTV]]. He converted to [[Islam]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvinsparks.blogspot.com/2009/11/marvin-sparks-x-raekwon-interview.html |title=Marvin Sparks x Raekwon interview |last=Sparks |first=Marvin |date=2009-11-03 |work=Marvin Sparks |access-date=November 22, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117192549/http://marvinsparks.blogspot.com/2009/11/marvin-sparks-x-raekwon-interview.html |archive-date=January 17, 2010 }}</ref>

In December 2009, HipHopDx released their 2009 Awards, with ''Only Built For Cuban Linx... Pt. II'' being chosen as 'Album of the Year'. Dx described it as "...the Hip Hop equivalent to ''[[The Godfather Part II|The Godfather 2]]'', with Rae as revitalized as [[Marlon Brando|Marlon]] was...". In addition, Raekwon was selected as 'Emcee of the Year' (fellow New Yorker [[Nas]] had won in 2008). Their staff justified this pick with this description of Raekwon's career in 2009:
{{quote|Raekwon brought it back to lyrical, dope rap. He released an album that spoke to teens, twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and beyond. Without compromising, the Chef made an edgy Hip Hop record that refused to bastardize the catalog he laid down 15 years ago. On top of that, Rae (along with Ghostface) was a go-to for numerous rappers making albums, ranging from the Playaz Circle to Jadakiss to BK One. That's beyond real, as was a year filled with performing in arenas, clubs and even churches. When it came to mastering the ceremony, Rae had 'em all following the leader.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/editorials/id.1465/title.2009-hiphopdx-awards |title=2009 HipHopDX Awards &#124; Discussing Lil' Wayne, Drake & Many More Hip Hop Artists |magazine=HipHopDX |date=2009-12-22 |access-date=2010-08-19 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819130244/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/editorials/id.1465/title.2009-hiphopdx-awards |archive-date=2010-08-19 }}</ref>|HipHopDX}}

===''Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang''===

After the critical and relative commercial success of ''Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II'', Raekwon collaborated with Method Man and Ghostface Killah for ''[[Wu-Massacre]]'', a short trio album designed to showcase unity within the group. Following this release, Raekwon resurrected talk of ''[[Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang]]'', a project announced in 2007, originally planned as a Wu-Tang album, minus RZA, due to his response to the previous group album ''[[8 Diagrams]]''. Raekwon forwarded his projects continuously through his growing label Icewater. He both worked on his own project while signing other underground artists.

Although not a Wu-Tang Clan project, ''Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang'' was released in March 2011, serving as Raekwon's fifth solo LP. As originally planned, RZA did not participate on the project,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vibe.com/posts/raekwon-new-album-ghost-meth-deck-gza-black-thought-no-rza |title=Raekwon On New Album: Ghost, Meth, Black Thought In; No RZA |publisher=VIBE |access-date=2010-08-19 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808022307/http://www.vibe.com/posts/raekwon-new-album-ghost-meth-deck-gza-black-thought-no-rza |archive-date=2010-08-08 }}</ref> however, several other Wu-Tang members made appearances, as well as [[Black Thought]], [[Nas]] and [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]],<ref>Young, Alex.

On March 24, 2017, Raekwon released a studio album, ''The Wild'', his first not to feature collaborations with fellow members of the Wu-Tang Clan. Critical reception was positive, with Pitchfork saying the album was stronger than ''Fly'', which it alleged had a "bloated roster".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23145-the-wild/|title=Raekwon: The Wild|website=Pitchfork.com}}</ref> Consequence of Sound agreed, saying ''The Wild'' was largely understood as a return to form by Raekwon, with fewer guest appearances by other artists than usual and more focus on Raekwon's long-established style, albeit with the "maximalist modern production" he had employed on ''Fly''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/03/album-review-raekwon-the-wild/|title=Album Review: Raekwon - The Wild|website=Consequenceofsound.net|date=March 23, 2017}}</ref>
