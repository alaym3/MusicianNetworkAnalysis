'''Elitni Odredi''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Елитни Одреди, [[English language|English]]: ''Elite Units'') was a [[Serbia]]n [[pop-rap]] duo from [[Belgrade]], formed in 2005. They were composed of two rappers and long-time friends; [[Relja Popović]] and Vladimir Matović. Initially an underground [[hip-hop]] group, they reached mainstream success by switching to a more commercial and club-oriented sound.

Elitni Odredi was also one of the first regional acts to use platforms such as [[Myspace]] and [[YouTube]] to promote their music, while generally avoiding media. They are recognised as one of the most successful and iconic regional acts of the early [[2010s in music|2010s]].

==History==
The group, initially named ''Ulični Pesnici Crew'' (''Street Poets Crew''), was formed by two classmates, Relja Popović and Vladimir Matović, in seventh grade. They renamed it to Elitni Odredi in 2005 and included Nemanja Poznanović and producer Vladan Paunović.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espreso.rs/showbiz/zvezde/54204/danas-bi-on-bio-sa-nikolijom-ali-relju-i-vladu-svi-znaju-ali-da-li-se-secate-treceg-clana-elitnih-odreda/strana/2|title=Da li sesećate trećeg člana Elitnih Odreda?|language= Serbian}}</ref> The first songs they released were "Ako Ste Za Rakiju" (''If You Want [[Rakija]]''), "Biće Ekstra" (''It's Gonna Be Awesome''), "Šale" (''Jokes'') and others. However, only upon the release of "Moja Jedina" (''My Only One'') featuring Nemanja Poznanović (Padrino) and produced by Paunović, in 2006, the group gained widespread fame across Serbia and other former Yugoslav countries. Poznanović and Paunović soon split with the group.

Their first and to date only body of work, titled ''Oko Sveta'' ([[English language|English]]: ''Around The World''), was released in 2010 through Gold production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Elitni-Odredi-Oko-Sveta/release/13532533|title= Oko sveta - Elitni Odredi|website=[[Discogs]]}}</ref> The album was influenced by [[Kanye West]]'s ''[[808s & Heartbreak]]'' with its use of [[Auto-Tune]] vocal processor and [[R&B]] influence. It spawned several stand out hits such as "Raj" (''Heaven''), "Džek i Čivas" (''Jack and Chivas''), "Ljubav i Milion Dolara" (''Love and Million Dollars'') and "Samo Da Si Sa Mnom" (''Only that You're with Me'').

In October 2011, they released single "Kao kokain" (''Like Cocaine''). A month later, Elitni Odredi were featured on "Beograd" (''Belgrade'') by DJ Shone alongside [[Anabela Atijas|Anabela]]. With these releases their sound shifted to more electronic and pop, which brought them mainstream success. Elitni Odredi were also among few non-folk acts to perform in clubs throughout [[Serbian diaspora]].

In August 2012, they released "Ne koči" (''Don't Pull Over'') under IDJTunes, which was [[turbo-folk|pop-folk]]-oriented. While in September, Elitni Odredi had a collaboration with singer [[Mia Borisavljević]], titled "Nisi s njom" (''You Are not with Her''). A month later, they also released "Ljubavi moja" (''My Love'') featuring [[Dado Polumenta]].

Single "Zapali grad" (''Burn Down The City'') was released in October the following year. In December, duo released "Ima mnogo žena i kafana" (''There's a lot of Women and [[Kafana]]s'').

They then embarked on an [[Australia]]n tour at the beginning of 2014. In July, Elitni Odredi released "Ona sija" (''She Shines'').<ref name="Ona Sija iTunes">{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/gb/album/ona-sija-feat-dj-mateo-single/1320968053|title=Ona sija (feat.

Despite being their final single, it is also their most viewed one with over sixty million views.<ref name="Alkohola Litar iTunes">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/alkohola-litar-feat-dj-mladja-nikolija-single/1320968344|title=Alkohola Litar (feat.

After several months of media speculation, in an interview for [[Prva Srpska Televizija|Prva TV]] in January 2015, Elitni Odredi announced that they were going on a hiatus to focus on solo projects, claiming that they've "overgrown" the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prva.rs/web-tv/emisija/exkluziv/16929/exkluziv-magazin---21022015/51801/-srecni-kraj.html|title=Srećan kraj - Exkluziv Magazin|website=prva.rs}}</ref> Many fans, fuelled by media disinformation, blamed Nikolija Jovanović for the group's breakup, because of her pregnancy with Popović's child.
