'''Rivers Cuomo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|oʊ|m|oʊ}} {{respell|KWOH|moh}}; born June 13, 1970) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hurley-mw0002031815/credits|title=Hurley - Weezer {{!}} Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=July 3, 2019}}</ref> He is the lead vocalist, guitarist, pianist, and songwriter of the rock band [[Weezer]].

Raised on an [[ashram]] in [[Connecticut]] until age 10, Cuomo moved to Los Angeles at 18, where he played in several rock bands before forming Weezer in 1992. Burnt out after the success of Weezer's [[Weezer (Blue Album)|self-titled debut album]], Cuomo enrolled at [[Harvard University]] but dropped out to record Weezer's second album, [[Pinkerton (album)|''Pinkerton'']] (1996); he re-enrolled and graduated in 2008. Though ''Pinkerton'' is now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s and has been [[certified platinum]], it was initially a commercial and critical failure, pushing Cuomo's songwriting toward pop music.

Cuomo has released thirteen compilation albums of home demos: ''[[Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo]]'' (2007), ''[[Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo]]'' (2008), ''[[Alone III: The Pinkerton Years]]'' (2011), ''Alone IV: Before Weezer'' (2020), ''Alone V: The Blue-Pinkerton Years'' (2020), ''Alone VI: The Black Room'' (2020), ''Alone VII: The Green Years'' (2020), ''Alone VIII: The Maladroit Years'' (2020), ''Alone IX: The Make Believe Years'' (2020), ''Alone X: The Red-Raditude-Hurley Years'' (2020), ''Alone XI: The EWBAITE Years'' (2020), ''Alone XII: The White Years'' (2020), and ''Alone XIII: The Pacific Daydream Years '' (2021).

Outside of his work with Weezer, Cuomo has collaborated with a number of artists, including [[B.o.B]] and [[Todd Rundgren]]. Cuomo and [[Scott Murphy (musician)|Scott Murphy]] have released two Japanese-language albums under the name [[Scott & Rivers]].

== Early life ==
Rivers Cuomo was born on June 13, 1970, in New York City to a father of Italian and a mother of German-English descent.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/29/popandrock|title=My sporting life: Rivers Cuomo, front man of American rock band Weezer|last=Collinge|first=Miranda|date=June 29, 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref> Accounts differ as to the origin of his name. According to one account, Cuomo's mother Beverly Shoenberger named him Rivers either because he was born between [[East River|East]] and [[Hudson River|Hudson]] rivers in Manhattan or because she could hear a river outside her hospital window. However, his father, Frank Cuomo, a musician who played drums on the 1971 album ''[[Odyssey of Iska]]'' by jazz saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]], claims Cuomo was named after three prominent soccer players: [[Rivellino]], [[Luigi Riva]], and [[Gianni Rivera]], all of whom were playing in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]].<ref name="page 32">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 3</ref><ref name="Odysseya2">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r147526|pure_url=yes}}|title=Odyssey of Iska &gt; Overview|last=Yanow|first=Scott|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 6, 2008}}</ref>

Rivers was raised in [[Rochester, New York]], at the [[Rochester Zen Center]], until his father left the family in 1975. His mother relocated the family to [[Yogaville]], an [[ashram]] in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]]. Cuomo attended the Pomfret Community School, and his mother married Stephen Kitts.<ref name="page 52">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 5</ref>

In 1980, Yogaville relocated to [[Virginia]]. The Kitts family opted to stay in Connecticut and moved to the [[Storrs, Connecticut|Storrs]] [[Mansfield, Connecticut|Mansfield]] area.<ref name="page 82">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 8</ref> During this time, Cuomo attended Mansfield Middle School and [[E. O. Smith High School|E.O. Smith High School]]. Rivers was a member of the high school choir and he performed in a school production of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' as Johnny Casino.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/4/26/rivers-end-the-directors-cut-the/|title=Rivers' End: The Director's Cut {{!}} Arts {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name="aloneroll2">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.riverspodcast.com/podcast.xml |title=Rivers 10.15 Interview with Rolling Stone |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=January 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120115015/http://www.riverspodcast.com/podcast.xml |archive-date=January 20, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="page 202">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 20</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YLZZzyWfCk&list=TLPQMjUwMTIwMjG1ybCyXn9_MA&index=6/|title=Weezer 1994 Public Access TV interview part 2/2|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> He also changed his name to Peter Kitts;<ref name="page 152">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 15</ref> after graduating, Cuomo reverted to his original name.<ref name="page 502">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 50</ref>

== Weezer ==
{{Main|Weezer}}Cuomo formed [[Weezer]] in 1992 with drummer [[Patrick Wilson (musician)|Patrick Wilson]], bassist [[Matt Sharp]] and guitarist [[Jason Cropper]]. "Weezer" was the nickname given to Cuomo by his father when he was a toddler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tricycle.com/editors_pick/3546-1.html|title=Rivers in the Stream|last=Karafin|first=Amy|publisher=[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|Tricycle]]|access-date=October 15, 2007}}{{Subscription}}</ref> Weezer signed with DGC, a subsidiary of [[Geffen Records]], on June 25, 1993, and released their [[Weezer (Blue Album)|self-titled debut album]], also known as the ''Blue Album'', in May 1994. Cropper left the band during the album recording and was replaced by [[Brian Bell]]. The album was [[RIAA certification|certified]] platinum on January 1, 1995, with sales of over one million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=Gold and Platinum: Searchable Database |publisher=RIAA |access-date=August 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> Despite his success, Cuomo tired of the monotony and loneliness of touring and developed a "huge inferiority complex" about rock music, saying: "I thought my songs were really simplistic and silly, and I wanted to write complex, intense, beautiful music."<ref name=":0222">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/i-songwriter-2140096|title=I, songwriter|last=Sullivan|first=Kate|website=L.A.

[[File:Rivers Cuomo in Thailand.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Cuomo in 1997]]
In March 1995, Cuomo had [[Ilizarov apparatus|extensive surgery to extend his left leg]], which was 44mm shorter than the right. This involved the surgical breaking of the leg bone, followed by months of wearing a steel brace and painful [[physiotherapy]] sessions.<ref name=":2" /> The procedure affected his songwriting, as he would spend long periods hospitalized under the influence of painkillers.{{sfn|Luerssen|2004|pp = 148–149}}

In the fall of 1995, Cuomo enrolled in [[Harvard University]] to study classical composition. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'': "The only time I could write songs was when my frozen dinner was in the microwave. The rest of the time I was doing homework."<ref name=":023">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/16/garden/16weezer.html|title=Student With a Past|date=February 16, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=July 20, 2015|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He auditioned for the [[Harvard–Radcliffe Collegium Musicum|Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum chorus]] but was not selected.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/4/26/rivers-end-the-directors-cut-the/|title=Rivers' End: The Director's Cut {{!}} Arts {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|access-date=July 20, 2015}}</ref> He became introverted and grew a beard, and wrote in his diaries how students wearing Weezer T-shirts did not recognize him.

Cuomo had planned Weezer's second album to be a [[rock opera]], ''[[Songs from the Black Hole]],'' but he abandoned the project as his songwriting became "darker, more visceral and exposed, less playful".<ref name="PinkertonDeluxe">''Pinkerton Deluxe'' liner notes</ref> Realizing he did not enjoy [[contemporary classical music]], and missing Weezer,<ref name=":023"/> Cuomo dropped out of Harvard two semesters before graduation.<ref name=":023"/> He expressed the isolation and sexual frustration he had felt at Harvard in Weezer's second album, ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'', released in September 1996. With a darker, more abrasive sound than Weezer's debut, ''Pinkerton'' was a commercial and critical failure, but attained critical acclaim later.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pinkerton-mw0000646499|title=''Pinkerton'' – Weezer : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|publisher=[[AllRovi]]|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref>

Following ''Pinkerton'', Weezer went on a three-year hiatus. Cuomo enrolled at Harvard twice more and completed semesters in 1997 and 2004.<ref name=":023" /> During the 1997 semester, he played with a new band, [[Homie (band)|Homie]], in Boston. In February 1998, Cuomo disbanded Homie and moved to Los Angeles to work on new Weezer demos with Bell and Wilson, but the sessions were unproductive. In 1998 and 1999, he lived in an apartment under a freeway in [[Culver City, California]]. In an essay for Harvard, he wrote: "I became more and more isolated. I unplugged my phone. I painted the walls and ceiling of my bedroom black and covered the windows with fiberglass insulation."<ref name=":023" />

Disappointed by ''Pinkerton''<nowiki/>'s reception, Cuomo intended to return to simpler songwriting with less personal lyrics. He stated that Weezer's subsequent albums, the ''[[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]]'' (2001) and ''[[Maladroit]]'' (2002)'','' were "very intentionally not about me. Not about what was going on in my life, at least in a conscious way."<ref name=":1" /> He also developed a greater appreciation for pop music, feeling that its multiple disciplines — including lyrics, improvisation, and image — produce a multifaceted art "that moves people and is important, and relevant to our culture in a way that serious classical music isn't right now".<ref name=":0222" /> In June 2006, he graduated [[cum laude]] with a Bachelor of Arts in English from Harvard<ref name="page 222">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 22</ref> and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name="autogenerated32">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.spin.com/2006/06/rivers-cuomos-harvard-graduation/|title=Rivers Cuomo's Harvard Graduation|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=October 15, 2007}}</ref>

On December 6, 2009, Cuomo was in his tour bus driving to [[Boston]] from [[Toronto]] with his family and assistant when the bus hit an icy road in [[Glen, New York]] and crashed. He suffered cracked ribs and internal bleeding. Weezer canceled the rest of the 2009 tour dates, planning to reschedule them the following year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/06/weezer.accident/|title=Weezer singer hurt in bus crash - CNN.com|date=December 7, 2009|work=CNN|access-date=May 22, 2010}}</ref> They made their return to the stage on January 20, 2010, performing at [[Florida State University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

During Weezer's hiatus after the release of ''Pinkerton'', Cuomo formed [[Homie (band)|Homie]], and performed what he called "goofball songs" for his "country band". An album was planned, but only one studio recording, a song titled "American Girls", was released. Cuomo has contributed to recordings by various other musicians ([[Crazy Town]], [[Cold (band)|Cold]], [[Mark Ronson]]). Cuomo managed the band [[AM Radio (band)|AM Radio]] in 2002 and 2003; he and the band's frontman, [[Kevin Ridel]], went to school together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1473358/weezers-rivers-cuomo-helps-am-radio-dress-for-success/|title=Weezer's Rivers Cuomo Helps AM Radio Dress For Success|website=[[MTV]]|access-date=August 1, 2016}}</ref>

Appearing on the [[Song Exploder]] podcast in 2016, Cuomo explained the process he used to write albums such as Weezer's ''[[Weezer (White Album)|White Album]]'' (2016). He maintains [[Spotify]] playlists of music with "cool" chord progressions that he uses for inspiration. He sometimes uses piano to write vocal melodies his vocal muscles would be "too lazy" to create. Conversely, he improvises vocal melodies to write guitar solos, to avoid guitar habits and create solos "you can sing along to" with "space in [them] because I have to breathe".<ref name=":0" /> He has a [[tenor]] vocal range.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kilby|first=Dylan|date=October 6, 2014|title=Weezer – Everything Will Be Alright in the End|url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/weezer-everything-will-alright-end|magazine=musicOMH|access-date=January 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Voyce|first=MacEagon|date=March 29, 2016|title=Guy Grogan channels Elliot Smith and Rivers Cuomo on 'Dynamite Bouquet'|work=[[AXS (company)|AXS]]|url=https://www.axs.com/guy-grogan-channels-elliot-smith-and-rivers-cuomo-on-dynamite-bouquet-79926|access-date=May 13, 2018}}</ref><ref name="News">{{cite news|last=Ashare|first=Matt|date=August 17, 2016|title=Review: Weezer's Rivers Cuomo has reverse engineered a really good album|work=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|url=http://www.newsadvance.com/the_burg/music/review-weezer-s-rivers-cuomo-has-reverse-engineered-a-really/article_1f7fca2b-8fc3-53b6-a5ac-a0be1bd1d18d.html|access-date=May 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Aaron|date=April 6, 2016|title=Weezer's new album is sonically brilliant, but lyrically flawed|work=[[The Badger Herald]]|url=https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2016/04/06/weezers-new-album-is-sonically-brilliant-but-lyrically-flawed/|access-date=May 13, 2018}}</ref>

Cuomo's process of writing lyrics involves writing [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] thoughts in his journal, highlighting interesting lines, and adding them to a spreadsheet organized by the number of syllables they contain and [[Stress (linguistics)|strong-weak emphasis]]. When he comes to write a song, he finds lines that fit the melody and assembles them in a way that suggests a story.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/rivers-cuomo-weezer-summer-elaine-drunk-dori-song-exploder-podcast-stream/|title=Rivers Cuomo Explains His 'Crazy Way to Write' Tracks on 'Song Exploder' {{!}} SPIN|website=Spin|date=April 18, 2016|access-date=April 20, 2016}}</ref> He rarely uses [[profanity]] in his lyrics, as "Weezer came up at a time when [[Jane's Addiction]] released ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]''—everyone was trying to be controversial.

=== Influences ===
Cuomo credited the [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]] as a major influence on his early songwriting. He told ''Upset'':<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.upsetmagazine.com/features/weezer-interview-kings-of-the-world-white-album/|title=Weezer: Kings of the world {{!}} Interview {{!}} Upset|date=May 6, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=July 31, 2016}}</ref>{{cquote|I remember when I was 21 or 22, right when Weezer got together. I went to the local used record shop in Santa Monica with the intention of buying a classic album that was going to be a huge influence on me and my writing for Weezer. I flipped through all the records and I narrowed it down to two records. One of them was [[Led Zeppelin (album)|''Led Zeppelin'']], the other was ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' by the Beach Boys. It was almost a coin toss but I ended up going with ''Pet Sounds'', and I really came to love the melodies and the chord progression and the emotion on that record. It has to be one of the biggest influences right when Weezer was starting out.
}}

On tour with Weezer following the ''Blue Album'', Cuomo listened extensively to the operas ''[[Aida]]'' (1871) and ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' (1904), the rock opera ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970), and the musical ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1980), which influenced the composition of ''Pinkerton'' and the unreleased ''[[Songs from the Black Hole]].''<ref name="AloneII">''Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo'' (liner notes).

Cuomo recorded the [[Weezer (Blue Album)|''Blue Album'']] with a [[Gibson Les Paul Special]] and a [[Fender Jaguar]], borrowed from producer [[Ric Ocasek]]. His amp was a vintage Mesa Boogie Mark I. For touring, he initially used a sonic blue Warmoth [[Fender Stratocaster]] copy with Seymour Duncan and DiMarzio pickups alongside Marshall amps. However, the guitar was destroyed in late 1997. In recent years, he has used additional Warmoth strat copies (in blue, seafoam green, black and blonde), as well as a [[Gibson SG]] painted in white with a Seymour Duncan bridge pickup. During the [[Hella Mega Tour]] in 2021, Cuomo has been seen playing a [[Jackson Rhoads]] which seems a tip of the hat to [[Randy Rhoads]], likely having a connection to the recent use of Rhoads’ solo on Crazy Train. The guitars are plugged into a Kemper Profiler amp.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/rig-tour-weezer|title=Rig tour: Weezer|last=Sharma|first=Amit|publisher=MusicRadar|access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref>

Cuomo was born with equal length legs, but as he grew to his full height, his [[Unequal leg length|left leg grew nearly two inches shorter than his right]]. After the success of ''[[Weezer (Blue Album)|The Blue Album]]'', Cuomo underwent the [[Ilizarov apparatus|Ilizarov procedure]] to correct the condition. This involved the surgical breaking of the bone in his leg, followed by several months of wearing a steel brace that required self-administered "stretching" of the leg four times daily; Cuomo likened the ordeal to "crucifying [his] leg."<ref name=":2">Luerssen D., John, 2004 p. 148–149</ref>
